 This install applies to "King's Quest" © 1988 Sierra.

 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick345.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.1 (30.05.03)
 - noticed that it won't work if the disk is not fixed (s/startup-sequence added)
   install script does the necessary fixes to the source disk
 - added Byte Bandit antivirus protection (found it on a copy of King's Quest I)

 version 1.0 (24.05.03) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - use fastmemory
 - quit option quits to system
 - saves to HD (updates file "disk.1")
 - Herdnon disk protection removed
 - solution included
 - source code included

 notes:
 
 - since original version has no startup sequence, and the game fails inexplicably
   but if there is one, installer script asks you if you want to modify your 
   original disk. If you don't want to, use a backup to install, and answer
   yes, or the install will quit.
   Best way to do it is to mount a FMS disk, copy the original disk there, then
   install from the FMS virtual floppy.

 - another solution would be to backup disk, create a startup sequence
   (file s/startup-sequence) containing "sierra" in it and use the installer
   on the copy of the disk.
