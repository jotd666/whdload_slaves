SETTING
This game takes place sometime in the future, after something has
happened and a "Killer Cloud" of poisonous gas has settled over
San Fransisco.  You play a police officer who is out to stop the
ever present crime element

WEAPONS ETC
There are several weapons that you will use throughout the
game.  All of which play an important role in the game itself.
Listed below are as many as i have seen and some which are
suggested by pushing miscelanious buttons.

    Machine Gun - Purchased from the super-niffty arsenal vending
machine.  This is the most used and effective weapon in my opinion,
you really dont need to get more than 100 lbs. worth of it though.

    Cannon - Also found in the vending machine.  not very useful
except for situations when your machine gun jams...

    Net Missle - Placed duringthe meeting at the begining of all
missions.  Using these are explained in the how to use and control
your shit section.

EQUIPMENT SECTION
    Suit - I don't remember the exact name of the suit but it's in
the vending machine.  If you plan to get out of your hoverbike and
walk around for a while you will need this.

    P.U.P. - A thing that picks up all the criminals you arrest.
You place these at the begining of the game in the meeting when
you place the nets.

    Extra Fuel Pod - This just gives you more fuel to cruise around
with.  I suggest getting this whenever possible.

A FEW TIPS
    * You must be within a certain distance whenever you are on foot
trying to do something...I.E..Arrest,Re-Enter Vehicle..ETC...

    * Run over Net Pods to pick them up.

    * Don't run over P.U.P.s they will be destroyed and you will
be fucked...The net pods look like a box...the PUPS look like a
new wave box...Be aware.

    * Make sure all of the susspects are in custody before you
attempt to re-enter your base...

    * When all of your objectives have been rechead,,,Land on the
station (anyone) and turn get out of your bike..Then hit I to go
inside.

    * Don't hit buildings after level 1 they kill you with 1 hit.

    * Use the external view when attempting to land F6...Also use
this when helping or waiting for the PUPS to land on the Station
it seems to work better for reasons i dont understand.

    * Place your net pods in the section by the station then
you can scoop down and pick up the nessesray amount and not
worry about it when you see an enemy.

End.
