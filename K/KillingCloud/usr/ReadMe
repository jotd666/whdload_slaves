    This is release 1 of a hard drive installation package for the
    Vektor Grafix game "Killing Cloud".




HISTORY

 Version 2.0 (26.11.2022) done by JOTD & paraj:
 - paraj: faster draw operation on fast machines
 - paraj: takes advantage of AGA fmode for even better speed
 - paraj: fixed more self-modifying code
 - paraj: relocated stack in fastmem for better speed
 - JOTD: now uses fast memory for better speed
 - JOTD: restored slave source code with missing bits
 - JOTD: added more document files (hints, keys...)
 - JOTD: adapted to whdload 17
 - JOTD: quitkey on 68000/NOVBRMOVE
 - JOTD: keyboard fixed
 - JOTD: only one version supported now
 
 Version R1 (11/2001) done by Girv
 - first release
 - supports two versions of the game
 - removed self modifying code
 - removed cpu speed dependent delays
 - removed manual protection
 - enabled instruction cache

NOTES:

- The game is MUCH faster thanks to 1) relocation in fast memory (hard work) but
mostly 2) re-write of blitter drawing routines so they use CPU instead, plus a lot
more optimizations from paraj. He already helped with the latest F/18 interceptor fixes.
Big Kudos to him!

- If you get "unsupported version", it means that your version
is no longer supported for newer features. Relocating the executable
in fast memory took a lot of time and I'm not redoing it for the other
version... Use old slave instead
