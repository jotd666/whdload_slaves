             KING'S QUEST I: QUEST FOR THE CROWN (ENHANCED)

   A long, long time ago, when unicorns still roamed the forests and
the merfolk still dwelt in the shallow waters frequented by men, there
ruled in the kingdom of Daventry King Edward and his lovely Queen.  The
people of Daventry were prosperous and happy, and and everywhere peace
reigned.  But the King and Queen were sad because they were childless.
They had no son to inherit the throne, nor a daughter to gladden their
hearts.

One bright, sunny day King Edward the Benevolent (for so he was called)
and his Queen were walking in the castle garden when suddenly before
them appeared a powerful sorcerer.  "I know your problem and I can
cast a spell that will bring you a child," he said.

"Oh, great sorcerer, if you can help us, we will be everlastingly
grateful," said the Queen.

"We will bestow upon you many honors, and great riches," said the
King.

"I have no use for honors or riches.  My payment will not be so
great.  All I ask in return is the mahogany-framed Mirror that hangs
in your private chamber."

The sorcerer's words gave them pause, for that Mirror was priceless.
It had the power to read the future, and helped to keep Daventry
prosperous.  The royal couple used it to foretell the weather for
planting and harvest, as had the kings and queens before them.  It
had been hundreds of years since a crop had been planted before the
last frost, or had been ruined by autumn rain.  What the sorcerer
desired was indeed valuable.  The King and Queen retired to their
chamber to consult the magic Mirror.

King Edward and his wife gazed into the Mirror's depths and saw a
young princely figure with a gold crown upon his head.  Imagining 
the youth to be the son they yearned for, the royal couple gladly
bestowed the Mirror upon the sorcerer.  He took it to his dwelling,
where he set one of his beasts to guard over it.

The months passed and the Queen did not conceive a child.  For the
first time in four hundred years, Daventry lost the harvest to an
early autumn rainstorm.  The King and Queen wept, and everyone
tightened their belts.  Instead of having excess produce to sell to
neighboring kingdoms, the people of Daventry had to supplement their
stores with food bought elsewhere.

With famine came the dreaded plague, and the Queen was stricken.  For
three days she lay in the grip of a great fever, with Edward 
maintaining a constant vigil by her side.

On the fourth day of the Queen's illness, a diminutive figure pushed
his way between the legs of the castle guards.  "I have a cure for
the Queen," he claimed.  Quickly the courtiers ushered him into the
Queen's chamber, where the King despaired.

"I have traveled a great distance to bring relief to your dear wife.
This powerful root known only to dwarves will cure any plague."

The dwarf leaned over the Queen and touched the root to her lips.
Her eyes fluttered open and she smiled at Edward.

The Queen's attendants looked at each other in wonderment.  "Only
a touch revived her," they whispered.  "Imagine how fast she will
recover when given the whole root!"

"Ask any reward for this miraculous gift, oh small one," exclaimed
King Edward.

"I ask in repayment the Shield left you by your father when he died,"
said the dwarf softly.

The King paled at the thought.  The Shield, made of titanium and set
with emeralds, was traditionally carried in battle by the ruler of
Daventry.  Legend held that he who bore the Shield was invincible,
and his army always victorious.  Thus there had been no successful
attack on the kingdom of Daventry for over five hundred years.

"Ask again little man.  I will give you your weight in gold, but
please do not ask for the Shield," said the King.

"You do not appear to value your wife's life, your highness," said 
the dwarf.  "I will take no other reward than that which I have
requested."  Haughtily he turned to go.

"Come back," Edward called.  "I'll give you the Shield."  The Dwarf
took the Shield, and secreted it away in a hole in the ground, in the 
way of Dwarves.

The Queen partook of the root, but to no avail.  She worsened and
died.  Daventry's church bells tolled in mourning, and the King
vowed vengeance against the false dwarf.  Years passed, and the news
of the loss of the Shield spread.  Armies attacked the weakened
Daventry, and the King went out to lead his armies without the
Shield.  Never before did they have need of the Mirror to foretell
enemy moves.  Now, that too was gone.

Many years passed, and the King was very lonely.  One day, while
out riding with his courtiers, Edward came upon a pack of wolves
tearing at the lower limbs of a big tree.  When the group
approached, the wolves scattered to reveal a beautiful young women
perched in the tree.

She descended regally, "I thank you for the rescue, kind sirs.  I
am the Princess Dahlia, of Cumberland.  I was travelling through
this land when that pack of wolves fell upon my group.  My bodyguard
fled in terror from their fangs, leaving me quite alone.  I owe you 
my life, and my heartfelt gratitude."

The King was charmed with the Princess Dahlia, and brought her back
to his castle to visit.  He felt new life coursing through his veins,
and knew it was because he had met someone who might fill the 
loneliness left by his late Queen.

In due time Edward asked Dahlia to marry him, and she accepted.  The
people of Daventry were wildly excited at the prospect of a new Queen
(and hopeful again of an heir), and made preparations for a glorious
wedding celebration.

On the night before the wedding, when the air was thick with toasts 
and merriment, Princess Dahlia bid Edward good night.  He never 
noticed her hand stealing up to his belt and extracting the ring of
keys hanging there.  Much later, the Royal treasurer approached the
King with alarming news.

He had discovered the treasury door standing open, with the King's
own key in the lock.  The Princess Dahlia had been inside, holding a
small Chest of gold.

The treasurer stood frozen to the spot.  The Princess' bright
laughter changed to a witch's cackle as her form grew old and
withered.  She grasped the Chest and mounted her broom to fly out
the open window.  The treasurer watched in dismay as she swooped
up through the clouds and disappeared.

When the King heard the news, he wept in despair.  The Chest was
magic, and the last great treasure remaining in Daventry.  No matter
how much was taken from it, the Chest always remained brimful of 
golden coins.  Without the Chest he could buy no more food, pay no
more soldiers.

Many more years passed, and Daventry grew poor and weak.  King 
Edward was old and feeble, and saw that his end was near.  Fearing
that the country would fall into even greater disorder when he
died, he sent for his favorite knight, Sir Graham.

"You are the bravest and truest knight in my kingdom, Sir Graham.
Long ago I envisioned your form in my magic Mirror, and thought
I was seeing my son and heir.  The years have proven me at least
half wrong.  But the prophecy may yet be fulfilled."

"To prove yourself worthy of my crown, I command you to journey
out into the world and retrieve the three great treasures taken
from Daventry by treachery and stealth.  Succeed in this great
quest, and you shall become King upon my death.  Fail, and our
beautiful Daventry will grow ever weaker until it is invaded and
conquered by unfriendly nations.  This I promise by all that is
honorable and right."

"May you return victorious, Sir Graham!"

Become Sir Graham and travel through lands of myth and magic to
recover the great treasures.  You must retrieve them all, for only
the combined magic of the three will restore Daventry to its former
glory.

Look at the fables and fairy stories of yore for clues.  Leave no
stone unturned, no avenue unexplored, and you will triumph in your
Quest.  Along the way, collect as many treasures as you can.  The
kingdom of Daventry will need everything you can bring back.  And
you will profit from the experience.

It may be possible to accomplish each task in more than one way.
The more imaginative your solutions, the better fitted you will
be to rule Daventry.

                          MAP YOUR PROGRESS

You will not be able to fulfill the prophecy, Sir Graham, without
charting your progress.  Create a map showing objects and
landmarks you see along the way.  You'll want to note dangerous
areas, in particular.

Here's a typical map:

Above all, try every direction and map all of the different 
possibilities.  If you overlook an area, you might miss an
important clue or necessary tool.

The road you must travel is long and perilous; it is beset by many
dangerous beings.  You must have the wisdom to know when to stand
and fight and when to flee from superior strength.  But take heart -
you may receive help in unexpected places.

Go now, Sir Graham.  And in the words of King Edward, "May you
return victorious!"

SAVING AND RESTORING THE GAME

To allow for errors in judgment, and also for some pretty creative
exploration, we make it possible for you to save and restore the game.
Before you try something that looks dangerous, or just because you've
been playing awhile and you don't want to lose what progress you've made
through some chance encounter, save your game.

At any time during the game, type "save game" and press return or press
F-5 to save your game.  Follow the directions below to complete saving 
your game.

SINGLE DISK DRIVE USERS

You have a choice of saving your game on your game disk (original or
back-up), or to a formatted "saved game" disk.  When you recieve the 
prompt asking on which directory to save your game, press RETURN and 
follow the prompts if you are saving on your game disk.  If you use a 
"saved game" disk, remove the game disk from the drive, insert the 
"saved game" disk, and type the name of the "saved game" disk followed 
by ":" and the name of the directory and press RETURN.  Follow the 
prompts, using the up/down arrow keys to select a saved game space.  Re-
insert the game disk to resume playing.

TWO DISK DRIVE USERS

When you recieve the prompt asking on which directoryto save your game,
backspace through the suggested default name and type the name of your
"saved game" disk with it in one of the drives, and press return.  This
will allow your game to be saved onto your second disk drive.  If you 
are using more than one directory for saved games, when prompted, type 
the name of the directory where you want the game to be saved.  Follow 
the prompts using the up/down arrow keys to select a saved game space, 
to complete saving the game.

IN GENERAL

Although your game position is stored on disk as a normal Amiga DOS 
file, you are not required to follow Amiga DOS naming conventions in
identifying your saved games.  If the character is standing before a 
tree when you save a game, call your saved game "STANDING BEFORE A TREE" 
or whatever has meaning to you.  You may save up to 12 different games 
per saved games directory.

If you "run out" of saved game spaces in your saved game directory, 
(and you don't want to create more saved game directories), you may 
reuse one of the 12 spaces. To change the name of a saved game, just 
enter CTRL-C or CTRL-X to clear the line, and type a new name.

RESTORING A GAME

Type "restore game" and press RETURN or press F-7 to restore a 
previously saved game.  You will be asked where you saved the game. 
To accept the default directory, press RETURN.  Otherwise, clear the 
line, type the name of the "saved game" disk followed by ":" and the 
directory on which you saved the game, and press RETURN. Now choose the 
game you wish to restore by moving the pointer and selecting it by 
pressing RETURN.
