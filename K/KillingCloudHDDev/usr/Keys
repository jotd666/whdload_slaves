           L =  Leave/Board Bike
           N =  Drop Net Pod
           M =  Arm Machine Gun

  extra keys:
  
  for F5: rear tracking view (1 zoom in 2 zoom out)
  for F6: scrolling external view (1 zoom in 2 zoom out
        3/4 pitch camera,  5/6 yaw camera)

Walk mode (after leaving hover bike):

           S =  Arrest suspect
           I =  dont press this it aborts game
           D =  drop bomb
           G =  get bomb
           B =  Walk forwards
           V =  Walk backwards

To leave the hover bike you must first hover on a building & turn the
engine off.

To find the robots on the first mission you must put your radar on max range
when you find one drop below the brown level on your alt meter to actually
see and catch the robot.

End.
