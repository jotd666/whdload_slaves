it to open. When  the keypad comes up, enter in the strange word you overheard
in the  secret passageway. Then enter the word that you  found in the Vizier's
ebony box. Together,the magic words are A-L-I-Z-E-B-U. Once you enter, uncover
the table and look at each of the items on it.

Problem:
I keep getting run through by Captain Saladin! How do I get past him?

Hint:
You  must give  him the incriminating letter  you found  in the  Vizier's room
quickly!

10. The Wedding
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
How do I stop the wedding?

Hint:
Once  inside the  wedding area, step  forward  and/or speak  to the  Vizier or
Cassima. If  you have been to the Realm of the  Dead and rescued the  King and
Queen of the Green Isles,they will enter and help you. Use the magic mirror on
Cassima. The mirror will reveal that Cassima is really  the Genie in disguise.
The Genie will attack.Avoid the Genie's spells by following the Vizier through
the door to the top of the tower.

Problem:
How do I defeat the Genie?

Hint:
When the Genie appears in the top of the tower and  you happened to have given
Jollo  a lamp  earlier in the game,  you can  use the  lamp to trap the Genie.
Otherwise, you must use the Peppermint Leaves from the cave at  the top of the
Logic Cliffs to confuse him. You will not  be able to defeat the  Genie in the
wedding area, only at the top of the tower.

Problem:
How do I defeat the Vizier?

Hint:
Take the heavy sword from the wall and attack him. Cassima must have a dagger.
If you  run into trouble, Cassima will attack him. Finish  the Vizier off with
the sword. Congratulations, you have just completed the adventure!
