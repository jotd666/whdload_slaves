                       ---------------------------
    Long ago,in the kingdom of Daventry,there were three magical treasures 
 that kept the kingdom strong and prosperous: a magic mirror that foretold
 the future,an enchanted shield with the power to overthrow any invaders,
 and a treasure chest that was never empty.These treasures were taken from
 Daventry by deception and stealth,and without them Daventry gerw poor and
 weak and King Edwar,once stout-hearted and vigorous ruler,had become power
 less and sickly.Edward had no heir,and everyone feared the chaos that would
 result on his death.
    King Edward asked his bravest knight,Sir Graham,to embark upon a quest 
 to recover the three treasures.Graham's quest was successful,and as his 
 reward,King Edward named Sir Graham his heir and granted him the throne of
 Daventry.The chronicles of Graham's search for the royal treasures of 
 Daventry are recounted in KING'S QUEST I : QUEST FOR THE CROWN.  
  
    King Graham was a wise and kindly monarch,and with his great wisdom and
 the return of the three treasures,Daventry prospered once again.But Graham
 knew that he must soon marry and establish his own royal line with an heir
 to his throne.He searched far and wide,but no maiden in the kingdom possess
 ed the qualities he sought in a queen.
    One day King Graham saw in his magic mirror a vision of a lovely young
 woman held prisonner in a crystal tower.The mirror told him that her name
 was Valanice,a girl both beautiful and good,who had been stolen from her and
 taken to a far land.Graham vowed to find her and set her free.After a long
 journey with many trials,he did,and asked her to be his queen.The chronicles
 of Graham's perilous journey to rescue the lovely Valanice are related in 
 KING'S QUEST II : ROMANCING HE THRONE.

    In time,queen Valanice and king Graham became the parents of twins,a son
 and a daughter.Life in Daventry was peaceful and good---for a time...
    In a land far away lived an evil and powerful wizard named Manannan.It 
 was his wont to kinap infant boys and raise them to be his slaves,killing 
 each in turn before he was full-grown and could pose a threat to he wizard's
 dominance.His most recent vassal,a boy he called Gwydion,was,however,
 unusually bright and peceptive.He mastered several of Manannan's spells and
 turned them against him to gain his freedom.
    After a ime,Gwydion's travels brought him to Daventry,no the lovely and
 peaceful Daventry of days gone by,but a land devastated by a terrible afflic
 tion.The kingdom had fallen victim to the ravages of a dreadful three-headed
 dragon,which had burned the land all around and killed many people.
    Gwydion was able to use his newfound magical powers to destroy the dragon
 and rescue an intended victim from his lair.He was taken before the king and
 queen and rewarded in such a way he never could have imaginated in his life
 as Manannan's slave.The chronicles of Gwydion,his trials and his journeys,
 are told in KING'S QUEST III : TO HEIR IS HUMAN.
  
    In later years,king Graham's health began to fail,and the royal physician
 were powerless to help him.Only a magical fruit from the farway land of 
 Tamir could bring about a cure and restore the health of Daventry's Monarch
 Graham's daugther,princess Rosella,set off in pursuit of this healing magic
 for her father.On her journey,she performed many brave deeds,and had many 
 great adventures.The chronicles of Rosella's travels and experiences in Tamir
 are described in KING'S QUEST IV : THE PERILS OF ROSELLA.
  
    With the king's health fully restored,and his family together once more,
 it was a happy and fulfilled Graham who set out for a walk in the forest one
 spring day almost a year since Rosella had returned from Tamir.The kingdom
 was peaceful and prosperous again,and the people were content.Birds were
 singing in the trees.It seemed an auspicious sign. 
    As Graham was contemplating his good fortune,a sharp wind blew into the
 woods from the east,whirling up sticks and leaves into his path,and starling
 the birds into silence.The air grew suddenly colder.It seemed an unexpected
 storm was approaching.Graham began to walk toward the castle,his joyful mood 
 broken by a dark foreboding.
    When he reached the top of the gentle rise overlooking his home,he was
 horrified to see only empty space where the royal castle of Daventry had stood
 only minutes before.Cold fear gripped his heart.Where was his family? what
 happened to them?
    "whoo-hoo...whoo-hoo." An owl hooted behind him,but Graham scarcely heard
 it over the pounding of his heart."I can tell you what happened,"came a voice
 behind him,and Graham spun around to confront a large owl in a blue vest and 
 spectacle."I know what happened to your castle.I saw it all,"said the owl.
 Journey into the magical world of KING'S QUEST once again on a quest for the
 missing castle and the royal family of Daventry.

    SAVING YOUR GAME :  IMPORTANT!! If you are playing from diskettes,you
   -------------------- must have a separate formated diskette ready before
                        you can save a game.Since each disk can only hold
                        a limited number of games,we recommend that you have
                        more than one disk formatted,in order to assure 
                        adequate space for save game storage.
    (to allow for errors in judgment and creative exploration,we recommend
     that you frequently save your game in progress,and that you save several
     different games from different points as you play.You will always want
     to save your game before encountering potntially dangerous situations.                   
     You should also save your game after you have made significant progress.
     You may name your saved games using a standard English phrases.For 
     example,if you are standing on a beach,you might call your game 
     "standing on a beach",or simply "beach").

  SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN : especially when you are about to try something new
 ----------------------- or potentially dangerous.This way,if the wort should

                         will always be able to return to a desired point in 
                         the game.In effect,this will enable you to travel
                         backwards throught time and do things differently if
                         you wish.
                        
 DON'T GET DISCOURAGED : if you come o an obstacle that seems insurmountable,
------------------------ don't despair.Spend some time exploring another area

                         solution,and some have more than one.Sometimes 
                         solving a problem one way will make it harder to 
                         solve the next,and sometimes it will make it easier
                         if you get stuck,you might try backtracking to an 
                         earlier point in the game,then choosing a different 
                         path.If all else fails,you can buy the KING'S QUEST
                         V hint book from he dealer who sold you the game,or
                         you can order it directly from SIERRA ON-LINE by
                         calling (800) 326-6654.
                         BRING ALONG SOME HELP,you may find it helpfull to
                         play the game with a friend.Two heads are better
                         than one at interpreting clues and solving problems.
