 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5/0.7 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

Here is my long awaited ultimate patch of this superb Psygnosis game!

During the install procedure you will be asked if you wish to decrunch the
data files.  This will mean you need 4.5Mb of memory instead of 2Mb to
preload the files but the game will load almost instantly.  While the files
decrunch the screen will flash green 25 times (once per file) to show it is
working.  This was hard work due to the fact that the intro loads the file
frontend.ppc to a temporary location and then relocates it and decrunches!

The annoying 1 minute delay on the Walker intro picture while it plays the
tune has been removed.  After the Walker pic has appeared for a few seconds
the main files will have decrunched and you can hit either the mouse or
joystick button to skip it.

On the title screen, you can use the joystick to start the game instead of
the function keys.  This is useful for people who burn games for playing on
the CD³² (hi Riempie!)

I have used Del for the level skip rather than the Help key since the built
in cheat mode for the game uses it and there might be some key combination
which does something cool which I haven't found out yet.

There is a slave included with speech disabled. This is because the speech 
must be located in chip memory and WHDLoad does not allow an optional chip
memory segment. If you have a plain Amiga without any expansion memory, use
the NoSpeech slave to run the game as the other one will probably not work.

A few people asked me to center the display in the game.  Unfortunately due
to the way the game sets up the screen it can't be done.  There are complex
copperlists which are made up from a number of different memory locations
and if you alter the DIWStrt and DIWStop values you get a lot of corrupt
graphics on the left hand side. You'll just have to live with it :(

Special greetings must go to Jean-François Fabre for the original JST
install and for some of the joystick support code on the title screen.

Thanks to Chris Vella for the original, Pavel Narozny and Frank for ideas,
Frank again for great icons, Mad Matt for testing, Ltd/Backlash for the
great trainer on the Fairlight version, Wepl for the superb WHDLoad, all
Action members and the WHDLoad team!
