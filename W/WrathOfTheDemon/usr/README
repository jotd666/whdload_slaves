 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.



Floppy version (done by Harry):

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and The Patcher 1.05 in the path (eg in c:).

Fixed:  Some access faults. (I guess the game ran not reliable at an A4000).

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.
Default trainer key is numerical ] (quitkey-2 in the keytable).
Pressing the trainer key gives full energy.
Once you used the trainer the program will not save the gameposition this
runtime anymore.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.

JOTD: fixed missing assign command when running disk imaging. Now works

CDTV version (done by JOTD)


 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick345.lha" on aminet.
