  *** WILLY BEAMISH HINTS FROM SIERRA ON-LINE, OFCOURSE FIXED BY [RYGAR] ***

                              Carbuncle School
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Problem:
      How do I get out of class?

      Hint:
      Eventually, Ms. Glass  will fall asleep, then you  can sneak out
      of class. Don't try to leave before she conks out, and make sure
      she doesn't  find out you have  a frog in your  backpack. If Ms.
      Glass  catches you  for either  of these  offenses, you will get
      sent to the principal's office.


      Problem:
      How do I get by Coach Beltz?

      Hint:
      You can  make a hall  pass that will  fool Coach Beltz  from the
      items  inside Willy's  desk. Combine  the white  crayon with the
      piece of  wood and show it  to Coach Beltz when  he asks you for
      it.


      Problem:
      How do I avoid getting beat up by Spider?

      Hint:
      To avoid  getting mauled by  Spider in the  bathroom, choose the
      dialog response  2 when he asks  you to give him  something from
      your backpack. Then give him your Game Buddy.


      Problem:
      I've been sent to Principal Frick's office! What do I do?

      Hint:
      The first time  you get sent to Principal  Frick's office choose
      dialog response 1. Then give him back his toupee. Try not to get
      in trouble  again, if you  are sent to  Principal Frick's office
      too many times you will end up in military school.



                              The Beamish House
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Problem:
      Who is this Ghost Beamish character?

      Hint:
      Ghost Beamish is the spirit  of Willy's Grandfather. He provides
      Willy with helpful information and guidance throughout the game.
      Ghost Beamish provides the first  warning that something foul is
      afoot in  the fair city  of Frumpton. Most  of the time  it is a
      good idea to listen to what Ghost Beamish has to tell you.


      Problem:
      Help! I keep getting sent to military school!

      Hint:
      When you  get a warning from  Gordon or Sheila to  do something,
      you  have a  short amount  of time  to do  it before the trouble
      meter begins to climb into the danger zone. If Willy ignores his
      parents  or  misbehaves  too  frequently  he  will  get  sent to
      military  school. Promptly  doing what  you are  told and common
      sense will keep you out of trouble for the most part.


      Problem:
      What do I do about the mail?

      Hint:
      You are better off leaving your report card in the mail slot. If
      you get  caught trying to  hide Willy's report  card from Gordon
      and Sheila, military school will be the inevitable result.


      Problem:
      What do I do if I cut my thumb?

      Hint:
      If you cut your thumb while  slicing veggies in the kitchen, you
      need to go to the upstairs bathroom and use the first-aid kit in
      the cupboard. Make sure that you put both iodine and band-aid on
      it. If  you don't take care  of the cut it  will become infected
      and you won't be able to win the Nintari Championships.


      Problem:
      How can I get my Nintari Key away from Tiffany?

      Hint:
      There are two ways to get the Nintari Key away from Tiffany. You
      can  either take  her diary  and blackmail  her with  it in  her
      bedroom or you can drop Horny on  her when she is in the bathtub
      after dinner  on day 1. Make  sure that you practice  Nintari at
      least once or you can't win  the championships at the end of the
      game.


      Problem:
      How do I get away from the baby-sitter from hell?

      Hint:
      Once the baby sitter from hell goes batty, you only have a short
      amount  of time  to act.  Go upstairs  to the  bathroom and  get
      Tiffany's hairspray out of the cupboard. Then spray the bat with
      the  hairspray; this  will give  you more  time to  complete the
      puzzle. Next, go to Brianna's room  and take the mouse away from
      the cat.  After you have  the mouse, go  back downstairs to  the
      living room  and jump behind  the sofa. Place  the mouse on  the
      coffee table and  when Alicia-bat pounces on it,  use the vacuum
      cleaner to suck her up.


      Problem:
      What should I do with Duffy?

      Hint:
      You  need to  feed Duffy  whenever  he  is hungry  and walk  him
      regularly. If you don't take good  enough care of Duffy, he will
      get you  into trouble. If you  neglect him he will  run away and
      the game is over.


      Problem:
      How do I deal with Brianna?

      Hint:
      If you play with Brianna on  the swings in the back yard, choose
      the second dialog response when she asks you to push her higher.
      If you  send her into orbit  you may as well  pack your bags for
      military school. Picking  Brianna up when she falls  off her bed
      after dinner  on the first day  will make your trouble  meter go
      down.


      Problem:
      What do I have to do to get some money?

      Hint:
      There are two ways for Willy  to earn money at the Beamish Home.
      The first chance  is to mow the lawn after  dinner on day 1. The
      second opportunity  is to wash the  Grange Rover after breakfast
      on day 2.



                             Willy's Neighborhood
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Problem:
      What do I in the tree fort on day 2?

      Hint:
      Tree Fort Headquarters is where Willy likes to hang out with his
      friends, Dana and Perry. On day 2 you need to make sure that you
      get the  Biffo Man comic book  from the tree fort.  You can also
      trade  Perry for  the Mickey  Morris baseball  card if  you have
      Tiffany's diary, but this is not crucial to solving the game.


      Problem:
      How about the tree fort after Day 2?

      Hint:
      After day 2 you can convince Dana to enter Gigi in the Tootsweet
      frog jump if you give her a T-shirt from the OK T-shirt Kiosk in
      Olde Towne. On day 3 you can get  a jar of fire ants in the tree
      fort.


      Problem:
      What do I do at Sloeffer Park?

      Hint:
      Sloeffer park is the perfect place  for Horny to get in a little
      jumping practice.  If you really want  to see Horny leap,  buy a
      can of  Slam Dunk from  the vendor  in  the park and  give him a
      swig. You should also check out what happens when you feed Horny
      the flies and the fire ants.



                                 Olde Towne
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~
      Problem:
      I can't get past the Bully in the Slice of Life Pizza rest room!

      Hint:
      A little skullduggery is called  for here. Take the "No Smoking"
      sign off the  wall near the sink and throw  it in the trash can.
      When Spider comes in, give him  the Biffo Man comic book you got
      at the tree fort. Spider will have a real blast with it.


      Problem:
      What do I do at the OK T-shirt Kiosk?

      Hint:
      If you bought a photo in the Slice of Life pizzeria and did your
      chores at  home, you will  be able to  purchase a T-shirt  here.
      Slide the kiosk  vendor 5 bucks and the photo  and you'll be the
      proud owner of a shirt guaranteed to last 1,000 washings.


      Problem:
      How do I get to West Frumpton?

      Hint:
      You can't  take the ferry to  west Frumpton until day  3 because
      Gus  has  run  it  aground  on  a  sand  bar.  Once the ferry is
      operational, you can  pay for your fare with  a ferry token from
      the Harry Humpford Memorial Fountain  or trade the Mickey Morris
      baseball card for a ride.


      Problem:
      I'm at the fountain. What can I do here?

      Hint:
      You  can find  a ferry  token to  pay for  your passage  to West
      Frumpton in the fountain. Make sure  that you only take one. The
      local  gendarmes  don't  take  kindly  to  people messing in the
      fountain.



                        East Frumpton/Humpford Mansion
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Problem:
      How do I get to the Humpford Mansion?

      Hint:
      You need to win the frog jump  on day four before you can get to
      the  Humpford Mansion.  One of  the  prizes  you will  win is  a
      jet-ski which you can then ride to Humpford Mansion.


      Problem:
      How do I get past Arthur the parrot?

      Hint:
      Arthur is  a very sensitive and  repressed bird, so you  must be
      careful  not to  ruffle his  feathers. Try  the following dialog
      responses: 1, 2, 1, 2.


      Problem:
      Can I do anything with this suit of armor?

      Hint:
      The suit of armor is precariously balanced and will crash to the
      ground noisily  if you don't  cushion its fall.  Get the quilted
      tablecloth from  the dining room and  place it near the  feet of
      the suit of  armor before knocking it over.  Take the helmet and
      the piece of paper you find inside the armor.


      Problem:
      What do I do in the Humpford Mansion dining room?

      Hint:
      Leona and  Louis are just in  the next room so  you need to move
      quickly and quietly. Grab the brass chalice on the table and set
      it on the floor. Then, pull the tablecloth off. Take the chalice
      with you  when you leave. If  you want to check  up on Louis and
      Leona in the  Big Game Room you can use  the magnifying class to
      get a closer look. Don't go in there - you'll get caught.


      Problem:
      How do I save the frogs?

      Hint:
      First, you need to throw the  brass chalice from the dining room
      at Chef  Childish to distract  her. Sneak over  behind the large
      cauldron. After  you reach the  cauldron, grab the  saucepan and
      dump  the sauteed  butter just  behind Chef  Childish. Scoot the
      cauldron closer to  her. Go back to the  entrance to the kitchen
      where  you started  and jump  onto the  frog conveyor.  When the
      conveyor brings you around, this  will startle Chef Childish and
      she'll  fall into  the cauldron  and start  yelling. Stifle  her
      screams  by stuffing  her head  in the  helmet from  the suit of
      armor. As  soon as Chef Childish  is taken care of,  release the
      frogs by pressing the stop button on the conveyor control panel.
      Then get  the heck out  of there. You  will still get  caught by
      Louis and Leona,  but the frogs you just  rescued will repay the
      favor by saving you.



                         Plumber's Union/Golden Bowl
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Problem:
      How do I get inside the Plumbers' Union?

      Hint:
      You can't get inside Local 409 until day 4 but you can listen to
      Louis Stoole address  the plumbers rally on day 3.  On day 4 you
      can  sneak into  Louis Stoole's  office by  climbing through the
      window.


      Problem:
      What do I do in Louis Stoole's office?

      Hint:
      After you  are in his office  for a short time,  Louis will come
      crashing through the door. Pick up the plunger near the desk and
      throw it  at Louis' face.  This will only  hold him for  a short
      time. Pick up  the security pass to Humpford  Sludgeworks on the
      desk and make a break for it.


      Problem:
      How do I handle the Cripes Gang outside the Golden Bowl?

      Hint:
      Except for throwing you the wrench,  Ray isn't going to help you
      here. Take the  smoke bomb the Japanese tourists  gave to you on
      the ferry and throw it at the Cripes. Then use the monkey wrench
      to open the fire hydrant and spray them with water. After you've
      doused the gang, run to Tootsweet  where you will again find the
      Japanese tourists.


      Problem:
      How do I get in the Golden Bowl Bar?

      Hint:
      Ray's astrology fetish can be used to help you get in the Golden
      Bowl, but you have to win  the frog jump contest first. You need
      the  radio/tape recorder  from the  jet-ski you  won at the frog
      jump to help you solve this  puzzle. After you get the tape deck
      from the  jet-ski, go to  the phone booth  outside the plumbers'
      union. Put the phone receiver on top of the radio/tape recorder.
      Press record  and dial 432-7446  to tape the  phone conversation
      with Alyssa. Then call the Golden  Bowl and ask for Ray. When he
      gets on  the line, play  the recording. When  you return to  the
      Golden Bowl, Ray will be inside on the phone and you can get in.


      Problem:
      What do I do inside the Golden Bowl?

      Hint:
      Poor Burt doesn't  have a lottery ticket. Give  him the one from
      the machine next to the OK T-shirt Kiosk. He'll let you stay and
      watch the drawing. Take a nudie calendar from the pile on top of
      the bar before you leave the bar.



                        Tootsweet/Frog Jump Contest
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Problem:
      Where do I get an entry blank for the Frog Jump Contest?

      Hint:
      You can  pick up an entry  blank for the Frog  Jump at the booth
      outside of the Tootsweet Building on day 3.


      Problem:
      Can the Japanese tourists help me against the Cripes Gang?

      Hint:
      If you  make it to Tootsweet  while being chased by  the Cripes,
      talk  to the  Japanese tourists.   They will  come to  your aid.
      Choose dialog response #1.


      Problem:
      How can I win the Tootsweet Frog Jump Contest?

      Hint:
      Horny can't beat  Turbofrog head to head in  the jumping contest
      so you have to stack the odds in your favor a bit. Place the jar
      of flies near Turbofrog, he will eat them and fall asleep. Don't
      feed the  flies directly to  Turbo or give  Horny the Slam  dunk
      Cola. Both of theses actions  will get you disqualified. If Gigi
      is at the contest, Horny will jump better.


      Problem:
      How do I escape the Tootsweet security guard?

      Hint:
      You need to combine the Nintari Key with the GI Jim dog tags and
      hypnotize the  guard. The correct  hypnotic phrase can  be found
      inside Dr. Jeckle's ad inside Willy's Meed Notebooklet, included
      with your game.



                              Humpford Sludgeworks
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Problem:
      How can I get by the striking Plumbers?

      Hint:
      Being  the red-blooded  blue-collar men  that they  are, you can
      easily  get their  attention with  the nudie  calendar from  the
      Golden Bowl Bar.


      Problem:
      How do I get into the sludgeworks?

      Hint:
      To get inside the sludgeworks, you need to give the guard at the
      gate the security pass you got from Louis Stoole's office in the
      Plumber's Union. The guard will  still sound the alarm after you
      get inside, so don't waste any time.


      Problem:
      How do I operate the bridge?

      Hint:
      You will need the plans for  the sludgeworks you got from inside
      the suit of armor at the  Humpford Mansion to solve this puzzle.
      The correct  color code sequence to  activate the bridge control
      lever is  listed in the margin  of the map. Enter  the four part
      code from the map: you'll know  you have it right when the small
      light over  the control lever turns  green. After you've entered
      the  correct code,  wait until   the guards  start to  cross the
      bridge, then throw the lever.


      Problem:
      What do I do in the Duct Control Center?

      Hint:
      Time is of the essence, if  you don't hurry you'll buy the farm.
      Type "AIR" into  the control panel, then wait  for the guards to
      appear.  When they  do, press  the enter  button on  the control
      panel to blow  them off the catwalk. Then  type "TRAM" and press
      enter to go to the Tub Tray Tram Room.


      Problem:
      How can I escape from Stanley in the Tub Tray Tram Room?

      Hint:
      Stay in the middle of the  tramwalk until Stanley throws his hat
      at  you. Make  sure you  duck  when  he tries  to hit  you. When
      Stanley's hat lands  at the end of the conveyor,  go pick it up.
      Throw it at him from the end of the tram - don't run back to the
      middle. When Stanley's body gets plunged, run back to the middle
      of the conveyor and jump on the piston that's sticking up on the
      left side of the tramwalk.


      Problem:
      Help! I keep getting lost in the Tub Tray Tram Tunnels!

      Hint:
      The blueprints  from the Humpford Mansion  are a map of  the Tub
      Tray Tram Tunnels. The toilet icon near the center of the map is
      where you want  to end up. When you jump  into the tram you will
      automatically be taken  to Grand Junction, then you  need to use
      the map. From Grand Junction go forward to Conjunction Junction,
      then take  a RIGHT. When  you reach Compunction  Junction take a
      LEFT  and go  straight through  Malfunction Junction, continuing
      until  you reach  Petticoat Junction.  Take a  LEFT at Petticoat
      Junction.   This  will   lead   you   to  the   final  climactic
      confrontation with your arch-enemies Leona  and Louis at the Hot
      Sludge Vat.


      Problem:
      How do I rescue Gordon?

      Hint:
      You finally get to use the  yo-yo Willy has being carrying. Drop
      the yo-yo on  Willy. Leona and Louis will  start running towards
      you on the  rim of the Hot Sludge Vat.  When they stop to laugh,
      throw the yo-yo at them. This  will knock them into the goop. Be
      sure to flush the main colitis valve after you knock them in.
