     The putter is the only club which may be used on the green and is
     automatically selected.

     Shots from the rough and good shots from the bunkers (with no hook
     or slice) will function as if made by a club 2 sizes smaller.

     The left mouse button controls the cursor to aim the shot.

     The wind indicator is on the right side of the screen. Allowance for
     the wind should be made at Professional Level. The height of the white
     stake indicates the wind velocity and the blue line the direction,

     The right mouse button is used to swing the club and hit the ball.
     Press the button to commence the swing. Set the power by releasing the
     button during the back swing. Releasing the button at the top of the
     swing will set maximum power.

     Hook and slice is avoided by re-pressing the button as the club hits the
     ball. The snap indicator lets you know if you pressed early or late.

     When putting you should make allowance for the slope as shown by the
     slope indicators on the green when aiming the shot and the power should
     be set according to the slope and distance.

     To go to driving Range press "R" or press "D" for Demo, when select
     player screen appears. Exit by pressing "/".
