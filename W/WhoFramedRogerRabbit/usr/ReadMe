 This install applies to "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" © 1988 Buena Vista Worldwide

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.0 (05.01.2021) done by JOTD:
 - 2 versions supported (SPS160 and the pre-release)
 - protection really removed (issue #0004021)
 - music replay fixed
 - CUSTOM1 bits used to set various trainers/levelskips
 - CUSTOM3 skips introduction
 - adapted to new kickemu
 - changed from diskimages to real files (needs reinstalling)
 
 version 1.0 (08.11.2004) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - document protection removed (thanks LockPick): note it didn't work
 - documentation included
 - source code included

Notes:

- both versions were incredibly very different. It seems that the game has been completely
rewritten from C (prerelease) to assembly (for SPS160) for no visible in-game difference...
And uses a different loading scheme too (still using damn overlay hunks!).
The non-SPS (pre-release) version has an extra "loading zone" screen that was removed (loading
is probably not hype enough...).
SPS160 version is reported to work till the end sequence, whereas the pre-release version
crashes after level 4 is completed (no, I'm not going to fix that, thanks, i don't have a clue
how to play this damn game)

- how convenient was it that just after I paused that release because I wanted to create a
trainer for both versions and all levels, Radertified posted in eab.abime.net and published
the offsets where code should be changed in the rogerrabbit executable for all kinds of trainers
on all levels, which saved a lot of time (even if the overlayed nature of this damn program made it
slightly more difficult, check source code). Also proposed a method to completely bypass
the protection screen. So big thanks!

- a third version was trained by Radertified but is currently not supported. Not worth it... for now.
