This patch applies to "Wonderdog" by Core Design (c) 1993 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD V17+
Game requires 0.5 MB Chip Mem and 0.5 Fast Mem (+ 1.5 other memory for preload option)

Version 1.3 (23.10.2024) done by JOTD:
- adapted for WHDLoad 19

Version 1.2 (26.12.2018) done by JOTD:
- added levelskip key (HELP) or with joypad: red+blue+yellow+green
- fixed in-game keys (ESC,P) which didn't work in some cases

Version 1.1 (25.08.2018) done by JOTD:
- adapted to WHDload 17: trainer now selectable from splash menu
- added option to enable sound effects by default at startup
- added option to set trivial passwords: AAAAAAAA, BAAAAAAA, and so on
- added option to enable jump with blue button
- added CD32 joypad controls: play => pause, fwd+rev => quit current game
- added option to set Megadrive-like background palette (thanks to Earok)
- now really uses fast memory instead of 1 meg chipmem (and thus playable on
  512K chipmem computers provided there is enough fastmem)
