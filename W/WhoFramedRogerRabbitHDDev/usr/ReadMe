 This install applies to "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" © 1988 Buena Vista Worldwide

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

 version 1.1 (xx.yy.202?) done by JOTD:
 - 2 versions supported (SPS160 and another one)
 - protection REALLY removed, no need for LockPick, it was trivial
 - CUSTOM1 bit 0 set: skips first part (car race)
 - TODO (v2)/TOTEST ALL LEVELS: CUSTOM1 bit 1 set: infinite lives
 - adapted to new kickemu
 - changed from diskimages to real files (needs reinstalling)
 
 version 1.0 (08.11.2004) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - document protection removed (thanks LockPick)
 - documentation included
 - source code included

Note: both versions were incredibly very different. It looks that the game
has been rewritten from/to C from/to assembly! And uses a different loading scheme too.
The non-SPS version has an extra "loading zone" screen too. I wonder which version
is the best and if it behaves the same with such a radical change.
