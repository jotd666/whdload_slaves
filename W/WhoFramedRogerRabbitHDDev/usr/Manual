            WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE

THE SETTING

     Welcome to Hollywood-1947- a busy, bustling, colorful place fo dazzle,
drama, and dreams; a place where you can go straigt to the top-or at least
across town on a network of electric streetcars called the "Red Cars" for a
nickel you can ride to the end of the line, where two bits buys a ham on ray
at the Terminal Bar and Grill.

- More (Y)/N/NS? 
     Cartoons are in their heyday, and our "Toon" hero, Roger Rabbit, is a
true superstar! But hes status as a Saturday matinee idol hasn't gone to his
head.  He's just a nice, ordinary, well-rounded guy.  That's right! Like all
his comic cronies, Roger is real, three-dimensional-just like you or me.  He
goes to work every day at Maroon Cartoon Studios and comes home every night to
the animated suburb of Toontown.

     Then trouble hits Roger like a ton of bricks! He's frame for murdering
Marvin, the Gag King.  When Marvin's will also disappearrs, it's clear that
someone is up to sone not-so-funny business...especially since Marvin, who
owned Toontown, had promised to leave the place to the Toons.

THE GOAL

     Things look bad for Roger.  He's on the lam, with that sinister
Toon-hater, Judge Doom, after him.  Doom wants to "administer justice"-in the
form of a nasty chemical concoction called "The Dip" that dissolves Toons on
contact.

     Roger has to move fast to stay out of Doom's clutches!  (It's not that he
minds an occasional bath, its just that he'd rather not be washed up so early
in his career!)  Help him stay ahead of Doom in a race to find Marvin's will -
and prevent Toontown from being dipped off the face of the earth!

PART 1: BENNY THE CAB

     Benny is a freewheeling, streetwise, and (usually) "wreckless" Brooklyn
cab with the gift of gab.  Able to hop buildings and rise above it all on his
accordian suspension, Benny's great in a jam (but watch out for bridges!).

     You're at the controls as Roger and Benny race Judge Doom through the
streets of Hollywood.  You can beat him, if you watch out for the weasels in
their Toon Patrol wagons, puddles of that deadly Dip, and collisions with the
Red Cars. (Try landing on top of a Red Car and see what happens!)

     Touch the Rubber Gloves to temporarily protect Benny from puddles of Dip;
the Wheels to get a burst of superspeed; and the Diamonds to remove a bucket
of Dip from your tally.  Keep your eyes open for other helpful items, too!
     Start your engines - and get going!

PART 2: THE INK and PAINT CLUB

     Whew!  With your help, Roger and Benny have arrived at the Ink and Paint
Club, the only place in the world where humans can enjoy live performances by
Toon stars like Roger's gorgeous wife, Jessica.

- More (Y)/N/NS? 
     Marvin's will is somewhere in the piles of nightclub receipts, napkins,
and checks.  Since it was written in disappearing ink, you must grab all the
papers in the club to make sure Roger gets his mitts on the will before the
music stops.

     You control Roger on his mad race around the tables collecting papers as
fast as the penguin waiters replace them.  Avoid the gorilla and don't ever,
ever, ever let Roger take a drink.

PART 3: THE GAG FACTORY

     At last!  You've reached the place where all those famous cartoon gags
are made. Unfortunately, the weasels are waiting to jump you!  But don't give
up - just grab the gags you find and use them to temporarily disable the
weasel you meet in the factory.  Since weasels are Toons, your only hope of
permanently destroying them is by making them laugh themselves to death.  Do
anything funny - the more gags, the merrier - and the faster, the better for
you!

     If you survive the weasels, it's not over!  Judge Doom is waiting for
you, ready for the moment of truth!  Lose and it's all over for you, Roger,
and Toontown.  Defeat Doom and you save Toontown from total destruction and
Hollywood from a future of strip malls, exaust fumes, diamond lanes, and
- More (Y)/N/NS? 
gridlock!

MAP of LOS ANGELES

     On the map, you can see Marvin's Gag Factory, the Ink an Paint Club, and
Toontown.  A glance will tell you how close you are to the Gag factory, and
how you're doing in your race against Judge Doom.

BUCKETS of DIP

     A bucket of Dip will be added to the tally when Benny collides with
something, when Roger is bounced from the Ink and Paint Club, or when the
weasels use a gag on Roger.  Once five buckets are accumulated, the game is
over.
