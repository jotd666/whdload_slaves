 EXTRA NOTES
 -----------
 
Hmmm..... not sure about this one!  It's ok, but its very formulaic, and I have
to question why its in 25Mhz?  There isn't a great deal going on in the game!

Usual Knobbylock protection, though this one had 12 modifications made by the 
protection, but as per usual, the protection was as formulaic as the game!

There is one bug in the Intro sequence that I couldn't track down, and thats 
right at the start where its supposed to write the word 'Wolfchild', but it
doesn't!  I'm certainly not going to stress about it..... you'll all watch it
once and realise its still a lame intro anyway!

See you all again! :)
 
Kindest Regards, Galahad & Frank
