INSTALLATION & HELP INSTRUCTIONS

ON-LINE HELP SYSTEM

   Control Documentation is available in the form of an electronic help
system built into Willy Beamish.  To access the help system, press the
ESC key during game play.
                                                                 _____
   Use the arrow keys to move the cursor over the button marked |  _  |
and press the spacebar.                                         |?|_|?|
                                                                |_____| 

AMIGA

   The following are instructions for installing Willy Beamish onto a
hard disk and booting the system.  Both can be done from either the
Workbench or the CLI, in the instructions we assume that you are using
floppy drive DF0: and hard drive DH0:.  If your drives go by different
names, replace the drive label in the example with the correct one.
For example, if you have an Amiga 3000, you will probably need to replace
DH0: with WORK:.

Copying Willy Beamish to a Hard Disk

   1. Boot your system.
   2. Insert Willy Disk #1 into the first internal floppy disk drive.
   3. From Workbench, double click on the Willy Beamish #1 icon and
      then on the install icon.
   4. From the CLI, type CD DF0: and press the Return key.
      Then type INSTALL and press the Return key.
      The Dynamix install Utility window will appear.
   5. Choose which drive and directory you wish to install the program
      to.  The default directory is: DYNAMIX/WILLY.  To change the path,
      click in the Destination Directory box and type in the new path.
   6. Click on the INSTALL button.
   7. At the prompt, click on the Okay button to install the program
      files.  To cancel the installation process, click on the Cancel
      button.
  
Amiga Loading Instructions

   From Floppy Disks
   Note: You may run the Willy program from multiple floppy drives.

   Self Booting
   1. Insert Willy Beamish Disk #1 into drive DF0:.
   2. Turn on your system.

   From Workbench
   1. Boot your system with Workbench.
   2. Insert Willy Beamish Disk #1 into a disk drive.
   3. Double click on the Willy #1 disk icon.
   4. Double click on the Willy icon.

   From a Hard Disk
   From Workbench
   1. Load Workbench.
   2. Double click on the hard disk icon.
   3. Double click on the Dynamix drawer.
   4. Double click on the Willy drawer.
   5. Double click on the Willy icon.
   
   From the CLI
   1. Load a CLI window.
   2. Type CD DH0:DYNAMIX/WILLY and press the Return key.
   3. Type WILLY and press the Return key.

Amiga Specific Notes

   1. Willy Beamish does not multitask with other programs.  For best
      performance, make sure no other programs are running when you
      start Willy.
   2. Although your system may have one megabyte of memory, you still
      may not have enough available memory to run Willy Beamish.  Self-
      booting the program from disk should provide you with enough 
      free memory to run the program.  
      NOTE: Memory allocated for hard disk partitions or resident
      programs will reduce the amount available for running programs.
   3. If your system has only the minimum RAM required to play (1MB),
      the Detail Level Slider is set to low and cannot be changed.
   4. If you are playing off floppies, you can speed-up game play or
      disk loading by turning off the music or by inserting the music
      disk in a second drive.

Trouble shooting

   Problem: Even though my computer has 1MB of memory, I receive a
   message saying there is not enough memory to run Willy.

   Possible Solution: Avoid running other programs before you start
   Willy.  Such programs might be using memory that Willy needs.  It
   also helps if you run Willy from the CLI without loading the
   Workbench.  You can also save memory by running Willy from the 
   Workbench when there are no CLI or application windows currently
   open.

   Problem: My computer doesn't have a hard disk, so I am often forced
   to swap disks during game play.
 
   Possible Solution: You can reduce the number of disk swaps by turning
   off the game's music or leaving the Music Disk (#10) in a second
   drive.  Press Alt-M to turn off the music.

   Problem: Constantly playing music bugs me, but I still want to hear
   sound effects.

   Possible Solution: Press Alt-M to turn off the music or select "music
   off" from the Options Menu.

   Problem: Everytime I set the game's Detail Level to high, the computer
   lowers it.

   Possible Solution: Unless your computer has more than 512K of chip
   RAM, you will be unable to set the game's Detail Level to high.
   Owners of Amiga 1000's or some older 500's and 2000's, will need to
   upgrade their computers to the 1MB Fatter Agnus chip to increase
   the amount of chip RAM.

LEONA HUMPFORD: A CITIZEN WE CAN BE PROUD OF 
--------------------------------------------
by Henrietta Sskisser.

   FRUMPTON-Frumptonians are privileged to enjoy the high quality of life
in our fair city made possible by pillars of the community like Leona
Humpford.

   Outstanding community service programs such as the upcoming Tootsweet
Annual Frumpton Frog Jump have long been a hallmark of the Humpford
family, enriching Frumptonians both young and old for nearly two
generations.  Following in the footsteps of the patriarch of the
Humpford clan, Col. Rev. Dr. Hipolytus Mumford Humpford, (may he rest
in peace) and her husband Harold Henry Humpford (may he also rest in
peace), Leona Humpford has continued the family's tradition of
generosity to the citizens of Frumpton.

   Indeed, even in the midst of deep personal grief, she affirmed the
Humpford civic commitment, remarking to the group of reporters
shortly after her husband's untimely demise in a tragic golfing
accident, "Harold guaranteed in his will that the sludgeworks will
continue to benefit all the citizens of Frumpton as long as sludge can
be turned into Tootsweet.  I will do everything in my power to make
sure the terms of his will are fulfilled."

CARE OF THE COMMON BULLFROG
---------------------------
By Prof. J. Arthur Toedkissrer

The North American spotted bullfrog (jumpinus greenwartia) has long
been maligned as a source for the unpleasant skin condition commonly
known as warts.  This assumption is not only medically invalid but 
also a grave dis-service to a benevolent and helpful species.  As any
young boy can tell you, frogs are great fun and make excellent pets as
long as you take a few basic steps to care for them.  To keep your
hopper in good health you need to make sure he stays moist and cool.
Check his skin: if it's cold and slimy then your frog is probably in
good condition.  As far as food goes, frogs can eat almost any kind of
insect but they are especially partial to ants and bees.  You should
try to feed your amphibian friend at least once a day, but he can go
without food for several if he has to.  It's also a good idea to let 
your web-footed pal take a swim on a regular basis: it's good for his 
skin and will keep him in good spirits.  A bathtub-sized pool is ideal
for your little green buddy to bathe in.  Following these guidelines 
will keep both you and your frog happy and healthy.

Local Boy Wins Regional Title
-----------------------------

   Frumpton's own William J. Beamish has won the western regional title
for the Nintari "Monster Squad" championships, qualifying him for the
national championships to be held later this summer.  Beamish's score of
2,349,997,186 was enough to beat his closest competitor by eighty
thousand points.  The Nintari Corporation plans to award the winner of
the national championships a scholarship and will feature him in
several upcoming nationally-aired commercials.  He will also receive a
lifetime supply of video games, a stereo, a minibike and a trip to space
camp.  When asked the secret to his success, the nine year-old Beamish
replied "I practice a lot and drink Slam-Dunk cola while I play: it 
improves my reflexes."

Supreme Interview after I dominate at Nintari Championship!

Lather: So Mr. Beamish, How does it feel to be the Supreme exalted
world Nintari Championship?

Me: Pretty good, Stan.  But I gotta tell ya: it took a lot of hard work
for me to get where I am today.

Lather: I guess so.  What kind of things did you do to get ready for this
championship?

Me: I had a very strict training regiment:  Every day I'd get up and skate
3 miles down to the video arcade and play Space Busters for a while.
Then I'd head back home after my parents went to work and practice 
Nintari.

Lather: I see.  What other things did you do to get ready for the
championship?

Me: Well, I had a strict diet: Dofritos chips, Slamdunk Cola, and
products made with Tootsweet were almost all that I would let myself
eat.

Lather: That's impressive self discipline!

Me: Well if you want to Hone your skills to razor sharpness, you have
to make a few sacrifices.
