CONTROLS
  [F1] -> Not used
  [F2] -> Radio 
  [F3] -> System Status
  [F4] -> Steering 
  [F5] -> Control
  [F6] -> Course Plotting
  [F7] -> Weaponary Selection
  [F8] -> Sonar
  [F9] -> Bridge 

[F2] - RADIO
 [*] -> Send Code. When starting a new mission you will be connected via 
        satellite with the HQ and a description of your mission will be 
        given. Click on Send Code to link with the satellite (the Send Code
        button together with 3 other buttons with letters were originaly 
        used as a copy protection - I think)

 [*] -> Msg Review
        Prev - to see the previous message.
        Next - next message.

 [*] -> Transmit
 
     -> To transmit your message. Using the keyboard.
 
 [*] -> Esm Level - I think it tells you if the enemy found your sub.

     -> Periscope Down/Up - raises or lowers the periscope (for those who 
        don't know what is it used for don't bother playing)
     -> Antenna - used for communication

 [*] -> On the bottom there are coordinates with mission time.
  
[F3] - SYSTEM STATUS 
 [*] -> Select - clicking on this will go through the whole sub and 
                 give you system status (damage if any)

[F4] - STEERING  
 [*] -> The horizonatal lever is used for steering left or right. 
        The one next to it is for motor speed. The lever on the top
        is used to make the sub RISE or DIVE.  
   
 [*] -> Auto Function
 
 [*] -> 150 FT - raises the sub to 150 ft below surface. 

 [*] -> Periscope depth - raises the sub to depth where you can use 
                         the periscope to see the what is on the surface
 
 [*] -> Emergency Surface - raises the sub to the surface in case of 
                           emergency (all the tanks are filled with air)

[F5] - CONTROL

 [*] -> Target - select your  target with the pointer (cross-hair) if
                 there is no object in the area you will be told so.
 
 [*] -> Launch - launches torpedos or a missile on the target.
   
 [*] -> Periscope Up/Down - raises the periscope to view the surface, and 
                           to aim at a target.   
 
 [*] -> Antenna - up/down used for communication (and I think for sonar
                  tracking too)
      
 [*] -> Periscope Rotation (in degrees) - to see what is around you.
   
 [*] -> Weapon Control - Launch a torpedo or a missile at a target.

[F6] - COURSE PLOTTING 
 [*] -> Target - select target.
 
 [*] -> Waypoint Control - Set --------> specify course.
                           Clear ------> clear previously set course.
                           Time -------> compresses time (speeds up time)
                           Auto Pilot -> self explanatory.

 [*] -> Plotting
 
 [*] -> Target Track - On/Off tracks the target you selected.

[F7] - WEAPON SELECTION
 [*] -> Torpedoes - 1,2,3,4 - if yellow it means it is being armed 
                              and put into the launching tube. 
                              When changes color it means ready
                              to launch.
 
                        1,2 - different type of torpedoes 
                              (the noise maker)
  
                          2 - Missiles - used for surface targets only!
  
 [*] -> Detonate - detonates a missile or a torpedoe before it 
                   reaches its target.

 [*] -> Select - selects tube. 
  
[F8] - SONAR
 [*] -> Filter - turns the filter on (High Pass/Band Pass)

 [*] -> Trgt Pulse - sends sonar ping to the target. 

 [*] -> Towed Array - underwater microphone, towed by a cable by the ship
        far away enough to avoid towing ship noise perturbation.

 [*] -> Target - to select the target you want to listen to.

 [*] -> Analyze - gives you analysis of the sonar ping. I know how 
        a sonar worx but this shit beats the hell out of me. I never
        use it , and sink the ships anyway. 

[F9] - BRIDGE
 [*] ->  Back to the Bridge where you can perform all the functions
         described here with your mouse (or like I do with 'F' keys) 

At the mission selection screen next to almost every mission are two 
buttons; one blue and one orange (dark). Next to the blue is says: 688
which is an American sub, the orange is either 700 or ALFA which is a
Soviet sub. You can pick either one. I will not get into describing every
mission, I just want ot make few comments -> 1. Pick the First mission to
get to know the game, and learn how to operate the sub. The first time
I played this game I lost but the second time I won, it is really easy to
master, there are few flows (bugs) and some things I don't know how to use.
But I play the game and it doesn't bother me -- I still win! I have problems
with the 9 buttons labeled with letters, when I click on one of them I get a 
Zoom function, click on other nothing happens! Use the Waypoint control to
set the course (where the targets are - marked with crosses or letters) and
set it on auto-pilot. then when you get close to the target, go no Periscope
Depth and look around, if you see a ship arm torpedos or missiles and 
nuke'em. If there is a helicopter coming at you watch out. I dive when that
happens.
