	That install applies to "Turrican" © 1990 Rainbow Art/Innerprise.


	That install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the WHDLoad package.

	You need 512 KB Chip memory and 512 KB other memory.
	
	This install supports the original PAL 'Rainbow Arts' (SPS92), the NTSC
	'Innerprise' (SPS1858), the 'AmigaFun' rerelease and the CDTV version.

	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").

	Features:
	- many blitter waits added in the main, intro and level sections
	- decuncher relocated and optimized (the one used in the AmigaFun
	  version is still relatively slow)
	- stack moved to fast memory
	- 7 copylock routines removed (in Levels 1,2,4,4,5,5,5)
	- interrupt acknowledges fixed
	- new random generator because the old one has read the ROM area
	- keyboard handling fixed
	- keyboard reenabled in the CDTV version
	- delays for intro speech/picture added
	- some access faults fixed
	- all files (except the AmigaFun release) can be packed with ProPack
	  or an other supported decruncher, some files are already compressed
	- buttonwait added for intro picture
    
	Thanks and greetings are going to Matthew Holliday and Chris Vella
	for support and patience. Thanks also to the testers on eab.
