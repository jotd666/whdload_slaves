Some quick answers to common questions..
change targets with the c key
hit z to use the laser bomb sites
'040 version is a little buggy, seems to only work on stock A4000s. Use
the FPU version. Processor settings in MCP or use of Oxypatcher make
the FPU code go a lot faster on '040 and '060s.

Press ALT L to put the plane into auto landing mode. Now go and practice doing
it yourself!

Hello everybody,

as getting the TFX-issue of CU Amiga was quite a *big* problem for me,
and I do not want to buy the November issue of TFX as well, I suggest
we exchange some information on the keys supported by TFX.

L - does NOT activate instrument landing, it only repeats the last
message

' - Instrument Landing System

DEL - Toggle mid-air refuel mode
(mid-air refueling is quite easy in TFX, just make sure you approach
the refueller straight from behind and within a reasonable range of
its speed)

alt W - Wind/weather report
(pointless, really, as the wind never stayed on, no matter how often I
toggled it)

the reference in CU Amiga that says '9' and '3' can be used to look
up/down within the cockpit should read 'Numeric Keypad 9' and 'Numeric
Keypad 3'

A - Autopilot
in all autopilot modes, speed can be adjusted in steps of 10 in the
same way engine RPM is controlled

7 - set autopilot to waypoint mode

8 - set autopilot to bearing mode - the plane will keep the preset
bearing and speed, bearing can be adjusted using the cursor left/right
keys

9 - set autopilot to tracking mode - your plane will follow the
currently active air target

\ - switch to targettting camera for the Laser-Guided-Bombs
(you still need to press 'Z' to lock onto a target)

Numeric * - increase after burner stage (RPM will be turned to
maximum, too)

Numeric / - switch off afterburner

-/+: throttle control

left-ALT J - Jettison all air-to-ground weaponry

left-ALT + cursors left/right - rudder control
(changes plane heading without banking, this is only effective at
speeds below 300 knots, great for correcting your runway approach) 

info compiled by Angus. Many thanks
