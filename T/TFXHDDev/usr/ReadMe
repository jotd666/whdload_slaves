 This install applies to "TFX" © 1995 Digital Image Design.
 
 It was released on CU amiga coverdisk in 1997.
  
 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 It can be quit by pressing num 'k' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 7.0 MB OtherMem (16 MB with PRELOAD)
 It also requires the AGA chipset and at least a 68020, but a 68030 and/or
 a FPU or even a 68040 or 68060 will help a lot with framerate.

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

  Version 1.0 (25.12.2020) done by JOTD
  - automatic executable selection depending on cpu/fpu (or manual)
  - self-modifying code removed (fonts were trashed)
  - CD32 joypad support for some frequently used keys (see below)
  - small manual included (thanks Angus)
  - source code included
 
 Installation:
 
 the game wasn't distributed in floppies but only in an archive of a beta
 version. To install, just create a "data" directory and unpack the files there
 
 Versions:
 
 there are a lot of executables around for this game. 3 of them are supported, the
 others (3 newer beta versions) are complete bogus/not working
 
 - TFX (554340 bytes): base 68020/nofpu version
 - TFX.FPU (503340 bytes): 68020/68881 fpu version
 - TFX.040 (599152 bytes): 68040/fpu version
   
 The slave tries to select the best executable for your configuration but if
 for some reason it doesn't work, it can be selected manually.

 Joypad controls:
 
 Obviously I couldn't map the million keys required but at least a few
 that are probably frequently used.
 
 FORWARD: thrust (+)
 REVERSE: thrust (-)
 BLU:     switch weapons (return)
 YEL:     lock to target (Z)
 RED:     fire (original controls)
 GRN:     max power (*)
 PLAY:    pause (P)

 FORWARD+REVERSE+YELLOW: quit to workbench
 
 Todo:
 
 - maybe try to make the bogus exes work
 - see if game can be made faster
