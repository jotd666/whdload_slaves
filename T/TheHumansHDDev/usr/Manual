Helping the Humans
------------------
        Obviously, the Humans need help. That is where you come in.
Can you direct the Humans through evolution? To do this, they
will have to make many momentous leaps to rise above the animAls.
Can they tame the awesome force of fire? Can they master the complexities
of the wheel? Will they realize that fur is out of fashion?
        All these questions must be answered by you. Can they survive in
a world 4000 years away from the invention of deodorant?

object, will now be in use and your ACTION BAR will change to reflect the

        Stacking is when a Human allows another to climb on top of his
shoulders. To stack, select the Stacking Icon using the SELECT key and

his stance. Now select another Human nearby (by pressing a FUNCTION key
or the "<" or ">" keys). Now move the Humanin front of the stacking Human
abd push UP on the control pad. This Human will now climb up the stacking
Human and will automatically be stacked on top of him. You can repeat
this process until you run out of Humans.

NOTE: Sometimes when trying to get to a higher level, you will move off
the top of the stack and fall. This means you have not stacked close enough
to the edge of the block. Make sure you are right up against the block
before you stack.

Using the Spear

        The first object you will discover is the spear. Here is what it can

His world is dark and mysterious; only he understands the ancient forbidden
knowledge. The Witch Doctor can summon objects from the spirit world to aid
you; however, there is a price to be paid.
        The Witch Doctor does not turn up in all levels, as he is an
important person and has many things to do ( Examining entrails and other
vital tasks). When the Witch Doctor DOES show up then he is still unwilling
to perform any menial tasks. The Witch Doctor will not use any object.
However, he will participate in stacks.

To Use the Witch Doctor
----------------------
Press the SELECT key until the spell of

your choice is selected then press FIRE to select. A Human standing
nearby will then be terminated.

Tips on Magic
-------------
        Insure that there is at least one Human standing nearby, otherwise
the gods will be angry. Let's face it, you can do without a deity as an
enemy. Let's just get this clear: these are the kind of deities that turn
Humans into insects and curse families to generations of misery. These
are not "nice" deities; there will be no "Well I am sorry omnipotent one,
will you let me off?" around here. The answer will be "Foolish mortal allow
me to turn your family into hamsters." Well you have been warned.....
Seriously though, these guys are really BAD. I mean imagine, falling over
and chaffing your knee... ouch. Pretty bad huh? That's NOTHING compared
to what these guys can do. We are talking MAJOR bad news. Really, be careful.
