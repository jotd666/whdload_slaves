 This install is for "Turrican 2" © 1991 Factor 5 / Rainbow Arts.

 Turrican 2 was written by Factor 5 and published by Rainbow Arts. Created
 by Manfred Trenz, coded by Holger Schmidt, graphics by Andreas Escher &
 Thomas Engel, music by Chris Hülsbeck.

 Features:
 - saves hiscores to disk
 - press F10 to quit
 - also supports the CDTV version of the game.
 - skip the Rainbow Arts intro logo: hold down the fire button as you load
   this game, you'll go straight to the titles. Or set Custom1=1 to skip it
   always.
 - cheat: press SPACE in the titles for the music menu, then press
   1, 4, 2, ESC, ESC. You'll have infinite lives and no points.
 - level select: press SPACE in the titles for the music level, then choose
   the music of world 1 to 5. In this new menu, press TAB to start the game
   at the beginning of that world.
 - for the floppy version you can compress the file '60000' with ProPack or
   FImp (no extension!) to save disk space, for the CDTV you can compress
   all files in the data directory

 Note:
 - the installation process will not work with adf image provided by the
   factor5 website, because this image has incomplete last track, with
   other words the adf itself is broken

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 The CDTV version requires 1 MB ChipMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

  - That was an easy install because Turrican 2 is well programmed. Nearly
    no fixes was neccessary only the loader and saver has been redirected
    and the decruncher patched because it uses self modifying code.
