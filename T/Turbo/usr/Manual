        WELCOME TO TURBO !

   There are three modes of play  in
TURBO, you have just chosen:

             GAME PLAY

   You have  just  entered  a  death
race with  no rules  and no  judges,
just you in your modified race  car.
Your opponents want to reach the end
of  the  course  so  much,   they're
willing  to  kill  you.    The  race
course is a stretch of highway  that
starts in the city, runs through the
country, and  ends  in  the  desert.
Weapons left by destroyed enemy cars
can be found on the course and  used
against  your  enemies.    You  must
reach the end  of the course  before
time runs out.


       THE STATUS WINDOW 

   SPEEDOMETER:  This   shows   your
speed.   You are  Cautioned to  take
corners slowly.

   SCORE:  Points  are  awarded  for
destroying the enemy.

   RADAR: On your status window is a
police radar detector, which  lights
up when the police are attempting to
arrest you.   Try not  to upset  the
police,  they   are  already   upset
because people  are  racing  through
the  city   at   120   MPH   killing
pedestrians.

         JOYSTICK CONTROLS

   Press up  on the  joystick to  go
forward, pull back to stop, left and
right to  turn.   Pressing the  fire
button will fire any weapon you  may
have.

              WEAPONS

   Wheels:  When  you  pick  up  the
wheels your  maximum speed  will  be
about 30% faster  and you will  also
brake faster.   Wheels  may also  be
used  in   conjunction   with   oil,
grenades and missiles.

   Spikes: These are the only  items
that  offer  protection  from  other
cars and motorcycles.   They can  be
used in conjuction
 with oil, grenades and missiles.

   Oil: A  fast way  to get  rid  of
tailgaters.   Drop a  little oil  in
their  path   and  they'll   realize
they're not as SLICK as they thought
they were.

   Grenades: An  essential  item  in
every Death racers Kill-Kit.

   Missiles:   Missiles   give   you
explosive power at a distance.  Very
good  at   removing  annoying   road
obstacles,    like    your    enemy.
Missiles  are  especially  effective
when used in conjunction with spikes
to ward off the police.

            SOME HINTS

   As nice as  it would  be to  race
the streets, death  racing is  still
illegal, so killing an enemy car  or
motorcycle will bring down the wrath
of the police.  Unless you are  very
careful or  have  spikes,  you  will
have to pull over before the  police
push you off the road.

   Keep an  eye on  the map  to  the
right of the viewing screens.   This
map shows where you are relative  to
the end  of the  race.   if time  is
running  out,  you  should  consider
using the WHEELS to get you farther.
At this speed you may not be able to
control the  car as  well, so  watch
out for  pedestrians.   If  you  are
making  good  time,  then  grab  the
missiles  or   grenades  and   start
racking up points.
