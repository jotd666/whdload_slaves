	That install applies to "Toki" © 1991 Ocean.


	That install requires WHDLoad and The Patcher to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing Help (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").


	if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
	a newer version of this install from 
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/
	if that does'nt help try some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC,
	NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. if that also does'nt help inform the
	author via the Bug-Report-Form which can be accessed on
		http://www.fh-zwickau.de/~jah/whdload/

Mr.Larmer/Wanted Team in 1999.

I added 2-button joystick control because the original controls are terrible,
e.g. when you want to shoot up and you jump instead (and die), it's very annoying.
Obviously you need a CD³² joypad or a differentiated button joystick (Sega) to play
in this mode (CUSTOM2=1)
