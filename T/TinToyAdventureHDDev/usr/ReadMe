 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 Slave requires WHDLoad V17+.

version 1.3-B (22.05.2020):
- fixed installer script (issue #0004641)

version 1.3 (09.05.2020):
- support for Micro Series rerelease version (issue #0004618)

version 1.2 (24.04.2020):
- fixed 2 small mistakes that could crash the machine (issue #0004541), don't
  use v1.1 (no problem seen in WinUAE, but 2 confirmed crashes on real machines)

version 1.1 (21.04.2020) done by JOTD:
- added joypad controls (pause, quit, levelskip). Fully playable with joypad only
- added up for jump option
- added trainer (infinite lives, invincibility, levelskip)
- enabled level/section select without invincibility/infinite lives
  (invincibility isn't very good to train oneself)
- fixed level 2 interrupt (quitkey didn't work)
- source code reworked and included

version 1.0 (05.11.2000) done by Codetapper:
- Full load from HD
- Snoop bugs removed
- Decruncher relocated to fast memory (you can decrunch the file TT if
  you find loading is too slow for you!)
- RomIcon, NewIcon and GlowIcon (created by me!)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

JOYPAD CONTROLS:

- blue/second button: jump (if CUSTOM2=1 is set)
- play: pause/unpause
- reverse+forward: quit current game
- forward+yellow: skip to next level

CHEAT MODE:
- Press 'P' to pause the game and press the left mouse button and 'HELP' 
  at the same time for infinite everything.  Now use the following keys:

          'F1'-'F5'______________Skip to the corresponding level.
          '1'-'4'____Skip to different sections of current level.

Beware: at level 5, pressing '4' to get to the boss locks up the game.

Some of you might say "Why a hard drive installer for this game when
it already has one?". The original doesn't work with all hard drives,
it forces you to install in one of 3 paths that it chooses, and it does 
not quit. So I think it improves the original version enough to warrant 
an install.

Besides, since 2020 update, it has now joypad controls and possible jump
mapped to second button/blue joypad button.
