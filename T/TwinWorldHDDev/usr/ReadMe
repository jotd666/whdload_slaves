 This install applies to "Twinworld" © 1989 Ubi Soft.

 Requirements:
 -------------
 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path.
 These programs can be found in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed game requires 0.5 MB ChipMem (+1.0 MB OtherMem for preload).

 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 Features:
 ---------
 - Full load from HD
 - Protection removed (MFM)
 - DMA waits in replayer and sample player fixed (x4)
 - Bplcon0 color bit fixes (x7) 
 - Keyboard routine rewritten
 - Trainer options added
 - High-score load/save
 - NewIcon (created by me)
 - Source code included
 - Quit option that works on 68000 machines (default key is 'F10')

 Here is another update of a very old patch. I have coded a RawDIC
 imager, added Bplcon0 color bit fixes and recoded the keyboard
 routine completely.

 I have also added a few trainer options which can be selected in
 WHDLoad's splash window. If you select in-game keys the following
 extra keys can be used:

 W: toggle unlimited weapons
 L: toggle unlimited lives
 1: 99 red bubbles
 2: 99 green bubbles
 3: 99 blue bubbles

 Please note that high-score saving is disabled if any
 trainer options are used.

 Enjoy the game from HD.
