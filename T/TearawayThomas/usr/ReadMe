This patch applies to "Tearaway Thomas" (c) 1992 Head-On Technology Ltd.
Thanks to Carlo Pirri for the original.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Slave requires WHDLoad V10+.
- Game requires 0.5Mb chip mem (+0.6Mb other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:
- Full load from HD
- RomIcon, NewIcon and GlowIcon (created by me!)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)

CHEAT MODE:
- These cheats were taken from Sweet Cheater by Keith Krellwitz!

        At any time, type any of the following: (screen will flash to let
        you know if it worked.)

                "NORMAL"_______________Disables all active cheats.
                "LIFE IS TOO SHORT"____________For infinite lives.
                "IRON MAN THOMAS"_______________For invincibility.
                "ANY LEVEL"___________________Activate stage skip.
                (Down cursor to advance level and up to go back)

        There is a secret level located on level 1.3, and can be found by
        climbing up to the ninth branch of the tree (which is the one with
        the birds on it) and running off the end. You then will be whisked
        off to a room containing some diamonds which can be collected for
        extra points.


I must take this opportunity to thank Galahad/Fairlight for his assistance
on this release. He quickly decrypted the game and cracked it so that it
could be installed. Great work!

Greetings to all Action members (including our newest member from Greece,
Torturer) as well as my usual testing crew and the WHDLoad team!
