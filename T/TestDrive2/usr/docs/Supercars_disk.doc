                THE SUPERCARS - TEST DRIVE II CAR DISK

TYPED IN BY THE HELLION & THRE COURSAIR. EDITED BY PARASITE.


THE MANUAL
This promises to be among the shortest product manuals in the history of
entertainment software. In fact, it has only one instruction:

1    To find out how to install THE SUPERCARS into THE DUEL: TEST DRIVE II,
     see your Test Drive II manual. Pay most attention to the section
     called HOW TO USE THE INSTALL OPTION.

That's it. That's all. But since we have the bulk of this paper left to
fill, we've decided to fill it with a description of each of the Supercars
in the disk. Here goes.

'88 Lotus Turbo Esprit - If you're expecting typical British reserve, guess
again. This Esprit is as sensuous and aggressive as any exotic to come out
of Italy. And any car capable of pegging its 160 mph speedometer is
certainly worthy of Supercar status. The Lotus handling is world famous.
The 2.2-liter turbocharged engine, irresistible. Keep a stiff upper lip and
let Esprit's 228 horses stampede.

Ferrari Testarossa - A legend in its own time. The elite of Grand Touring
cars. This Ferrari hits 185 mph with twelve cylinders singing in perfect
harmony. 0-60 strikes in 5.3 seconds and the quarter mile blurs by a 13.3 -
well over 100 mph. But speed isn't the only thing to snap necks. Take one
look at its styling, its wrap-around leather interior - and you'll know
exactly what you'd do with $134,000.

Porsche 911 RUF - Introducing Louis Ruf's gift to the automotive world - a
custom-built, twin-turbo Porsche 911. Top speed: 211 mph. 0-60 mph: 4.0
seconds. Blindingly quick. Acceleration that sucks you into the seat.
Supreme ruler of the German Autobahn, this 469 bhp bullet is perfectly
street legal. But don't let that fool you. The space program would provide
better preparation for this experience than driving school.

'88 Lamborghini Countach 5000S - Stunning. No other word best describes
the Lamgborghini's look - or performance. How can a car so outrageous be
so so darn fast? Take a look under the hood. The Countach sports a
powerful V-12 with four valves per cylinder. Before you can say "Giotto
Bizzarrini" you're at 179 mph. And nothing can match its stability at top
speed. Go out on the open road. Count how many times "WOW" leaves your
mouth.

'89 Corvette ZR1 - Tough to keep a 185 mph Corvette under wraps but the
ZR1 stands as one of Detroit's best kept secrets. Designed with one goal:
"create the world's fastest production car." Its engine, code LT5, is a
legend before its time. An all-aluminum, four cam, 32 valve V-8 so strong
that Chevrolet engineers had to completely redo the rear end to
accomodate more rubber. Is there anything simular to the ZR1? Check out
the Indy 500.

Important Note #1: After you boot up the Master Disk for The Duel: Test
Drive II, and you want to use the Car Disk, you must assign the Car Disk
to a drive. You will then be instructed to insert your Car Disk into the
assigned drive. At that time, a serial number is assigned, Play Disks can
be created with that Car Disk only with the Master Disk that was in use
when the serial number was assigned.
