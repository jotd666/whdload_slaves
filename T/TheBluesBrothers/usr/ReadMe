 CHEAT (courtesy from Sweetcheater by Abaddon)

 On the character select screen, type "WALLOO" (the background will 
 change to maroon).  Press a number ('1'-'6') then the 'SPACEBAR' to
 go to the corresponding level (with infinite lives)
 (note: this cheat is already included in the slave, except that infinite
  lives can be done separately)

 When finishing a level, get the second of the two flags, and you'll
 keep your record collection through to the next level.


 NOTES FOR V1.3+
 --------------

 I (StingRay) have changed the patch to use real files. This means
 you have to reinstall the game (unless you use CUSTOM3=1 to use old data),
 the RawDIC imager requires at least RawDIC V5.0! The imager handles
 the NON-DOS parts as well as the DOS parts of the disk so it also
 saves the "main.prg" file!

 I have also added trainer options and fixed the problem with samples
 not being played properly.
