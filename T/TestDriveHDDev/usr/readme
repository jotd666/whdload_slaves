 This install applies to "Test Drive" © 1987 Accolade

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 Thanks to Bert Jahn for writing kickemu.s kickstart interface system.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

Notes:

- Game flies with fastmem & caches. Try with NTSC for even smoother game
- I had to include the cracked executable (I restored the original credits)
  because I could not remote-crack it (Chris and I were not able to make a working
  copy with MFMWarp, too bad), although I could decrypt a lot of the
  startup code, for nothing... Must be Hernon protection, I could crack it now
  (did that on Final Assault) but why bother?
