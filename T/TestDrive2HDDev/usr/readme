 This install applies to "Test Drive II - The Duel" © 1991 Accolade.
 You can also install level disks and car disks.
 
 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

History:

 version 1.4 (21.02.2020) done by JOTD:
 - another version supported (issue #0004372). Note that this version doesn't have speed regulation
   in the menu, so on a fast machine "the duel" sample maybe shortened and replaced by "test drive ii" sample
   but I'm not going to invest more time trying to patch overlayed segment just for that. Other fixes are working
   
 version 1.3 (21.02.2020)
 - fixed wrong sfx replay during the introduction. This bug was there
   from the start (no wait after dma write, typical DSI replay routine bug)
   but was hidden by the fact that we were using chip memory only (issue #0004354)
 - "accolade presents" and more importantly "the duel" titles were appearing/fading
   too fast, resulting in the "the duel" sample not being played on fast machines
 - added "Northern Germany Challenge" support in install script (the version with
   files starting with "ger". If you have the other one, copy the disk, on the floppy,
   rename all "euro" to "ger" and use the file "scen.dat2_northerngermany" provided in the install
   (overwrite it on the floppy as "scen2.dat"). If you use the version with "euro" files, then
   it will overwrite the "European challenge" files if installed

 version 1.2 (05.02.2020) done by JOTD:
 - fixed the flickering bug on fast machines
 - reenabled fast memory (now that the flickering bug has been fixed)
 
 version 1.1 (06.03.2016):
 - converted to whdload v16

 version 1.0 (21.02.02) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - Clean execution using WHDLoad/KickEmu
 - Installer script which avoids some read/write errors due to the protection
 - Disk protection removed (done by anonymous)
 - Car/scenery disks support with index merging system, allowing to access all
   sceneries and cars at the same time
 - Docs included (see directory "Docs")
 - Quitkey quits anytime (ESC also works)

Hints:

 - Run the game in NTSC mode for better framerate

notes:

Incredible. About more than 15 years after trying to find the flickering bug, finally figured out the issue...

The game uses double buffering, but on fast machines (for some reason I didn't investigate)
it switches the copperlists in the middle of a frame while the blitter is still drawing stuff.
So gives the impression that the game isn't double-buffered when it is!

My fix was just to wait vertical beam until it matches the value of a
slow machine running the game at this point! and the flickering is completely gone!

Now I told myself: "time to enable fast memory". And the audio bugs popped up :) fixed too now.
