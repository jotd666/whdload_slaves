                       The Duel : Test Drive II

Typed by The Agnostic/CYBERTECH. Edited by Parasite.


Imagine the desert. Flat. Hot. Roads that drill straight ahead into perpetuity.
A driver's dream. Now, imagine yourself at the wheel of a silver gem known as
the Porsche 959. The world's fastest production car. That's what they told you
when you plunked down your quarter-of-a-million dollars, anyway. You're 
cruising at 200 KPH, feeling very royal, very king-of-the-road.

Nothing in these parts can touch you. Or so you think.

Suddenly, there is a blur in the passing lane.

You blink. Whatever it was had to be going at least 240 KPH. You put your pedal
to the metal and investigate. Up ahead, in a perfect red haze of automotive
harmony, cruises a machine unlike any you've seen before. Your jaw drops. It's
the legendary Ferrari F40 - as sleek a piece of Kevlar and carbon-reinforced
plastic as ever rolled off a production line.

You pull even. The other driver looks you over. He raises his thumb... then
roars ahead, finding another 40 or 50 KPH in the bowels of his 478-horse, twin-
turbo V-8. You glance at your instrumentation. You've always wanted to explore
the depths of that famous Porsche 6th gear. You shift. You rocket, head to 
head, down the desert chute. You wind up treacherous mountain curves. You hurtle
through lush woodland corridors.

And the cops are out in droves.

HOW TO LOAD THE DUEL

   1.  Connect your joystick.

   2.  Insert THE DUEL: TEST DRIVE II into the drive, label side up.

   3.  Turn on the computer. The game will load, and after the initial title
       and credit screens appear, the game automatically goes into its 
       demonstration run - a preliminary peek at driving nirvana. Watch the
       action. Enjoy the scenery. Let your jaw fall agape. (Also a good time
       to don goggles and scarf.)

   4.  Press the FIRE BUTTON whenever you want to exit the demo. You're whisked
       to the first Selection screen to set up your race.

HOW TO SET UP A RACE

   1.  Your Car

       * A picture of the current selection is displayed in the box (in the 
         picture here, the Porsche 959). To choose other cars, preess the
         FIRE BUTTON.

       * After the screen dissolves to the Car Selection screen (like the one
         pictures on page 2), use your joystick or Up and Down arrow keys to
         scroll through the available cars. When your favorite appears, press
         the FIRE BUTTON and the screen dissolves back to the Setup screen.

   2.  The Other Car

       * This displays your competition if you elect to race the computer. 
         High-light, press the FIRE BUTTON and the screen dissolves to the Car
         Selection screen. Choose the computer's weapon and press the FIRE 
         BUTTON to return to Setup.

   3.  Scenery

       * You don't need this option unless you have an additional Scenery disk
         (see box below). If you don't, skip to #5 in this section.

       * If you do have one, press the FIRE BUTTON. The screen dissolves to the
         Scenery Selection screen, which features the Mastery Scenery Disk
         (pictures of the three original roadscapes you face in THE DUEL.) If
         you've already installed the scenery disk (see INSTALL, page 10), move
         the joystick up or down (or press the Up and Down arrows) to examine
         other roadscapes. When you see the scenery you want, press the FIRE
         BUTTON. The screen dissolves back to the Setup screen.

   4.  Install

       * You don't need this option unless you have an optional Car or Scenery
         Disk. If you don't have them, skip to #5. If you do, please turn to
         page 10, HOW TO USE THE INSTALL OPTION.

   5.  Do you want to race against the clock?

       * Highlight the stopwatch, press the FIRE BUTTON and you're off to the
         Skill Selection screen.

   6.  Or battle the relentless, icy cool driving hand of the computer?

       * Highlight the computer, press the FIRE BUTTON and you go to the Skill
         Selection screen.

CHOOSE YOUR SKILL LEVEL

There are 12 levels of difficulty. Here's a quick breakdown of the range for 
the different variables:

      Skill level           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
      ~~~~~~~~~~~           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Auto Shift            x x x x

      Opponent speed        90 MPH   ----------------- Top speed of selected
                                                       car

      Cop speed            120 MPH   ----------------- 200 MPH

      Traffic Density      50%   --------------------- 100%

      Traffic Speed        30 MPH  ------------------- 60 MPH

      Scoring              33%   --------------------- 100%

*     Move your joystick left or right to choose a level, then press the 
      FIRE BUTTON.

HOW TO DRIVE YOUR CAR

Use the joystick to play THE DUEL: TEST DRIVE II. Here's how it works:

Joystick:
                           Accelerate
       Accelerate/left                   Accelerate/right
                      \        |        /
                       \       |       / 
                        \      |      /

                       /       |       \
                      /        |        \
            Brake/left                   Brake/right
                             Brake

To manually shift your car with these controls, accelerate or decelerate until
you're ready to change gears, then simultaneously press the FIRE BUTTON.

THE COCKPIT

Tachometer

Large gauge in center of dashboard. Registers in thousands of revolutions per
minute (RPMs), the rotational speed of your drive shaft. The bigger the number,
the harder your engine is working. If you work it too hard, or "red line" -
that is, push the tach needle into the red area - you'll blow all your precious
horse-power right out the tailpipe. (Watch for smoke in the rear view mirror.)

Steering Wheel

The joystick turns the wheel left or right. The dot on the top moves to show you
how far off of straight ahead you are.

Radar Detector

Located on sun visor in upper left of windshield. A blinking light means it's
on. If the light flashes and beeps, slow to the speed limit, because lurking
nearby is your worst nightmare: A state trooper with (1) an attitude and (2)
a shortfall on his weekly ticket quota.

Of course, you could try to outrun the toast. But you better be good.

Police

A cop will chase you until you either outrun him or he passes you. In the latter
case, you must stop and get a ticket. (Getting a ticket is not a good thing. Not
only do your insurance rates go up, but the clock is still running and you lose
valuable time.) If you crash into a cop, the game is over. That's justice.

At times you'll be coming around a bend and a cop will be standing beside the
road (car parked), motioning you to pull over. You have three options: 1) pull
over and get a ticket 2) speed by 3) run him over. If you choose #2 and he
catches you, you get a ticket. Choose #3 and the game is over.

Speedometer

Near the middle of the dashboard. You can't miss it. For the European-made 
cars, it's measured in KPH (kilometers per hour). Here's a chart to help you
convert KPH into MPH (miles per hour). For the record, one KPH is equal to about
.62 MPH.

        KPH = MPH                       KPH = MPH
        
        375 = 232.5                     225 = 139.5

        350 = 217                       200 = 124

        325 = 201.5                     175 = 108.5

        300 = 186                       150 = 93

        275 = 170.5                     125 = 77.5

        250 = 155                       100 = 66.14

Gear Shift

To make it appear and disappear from the screen, press D. If the display is off,
the gear shift appears only briefly when you shift.

Rear View Mirror

Monitor it well. Especially at higher levels, watch out for zealous highway
idiot of an opponent. A keen eye to the glass will help you keep on top of ol'
Smokey too.

Dots at the Top of the Screen

These are moving dots (three are possible if you're challenging, two if you're
racing solo against the clock). They move across the top of the screen during
each leg of a race, starting at the left side at the beginning and ending at
the right (or the gas station - the finish line of that leg.) The dots 
represent the cars in the race - yours, the computer's and the cop's. You are
the first dot at the start (red), followed by the computer (blue) and the
gendarme (he only appears when he's in pursuit, in yellow). The dots quickly
show you how much race is left, and how you're doing relative to the
competition.

TAKE A TRIP

Lives. You start with five, which is less than a cat gets, but still pretty
generous. You lose a life every time you crash or get a penalty. But you gain
one each time you refuel.

Penalties. You lose a life and get 20-second penalties (added to your time) if
you crash, blow an engine, or run out of gas.

Gas. Elixir of the road gods. When you see a sign like the one in Diagram 19.5
page 8, start thinking about filling up. When the two white lines pop up beside
the gas station (like the ones in Diagram 42.76, page 8), stand on the brake
and pull onto your side of the road. If you don't stop between the lines, you
can't refuel. That's not good - and you'll find out why in a few miles.

Go. Rev the engine, fool. You are now in gear. If you're on a manual shift level,
pop it into gear and go.

Shift. To shift up, hold the joystick up and press the fire button. To shift 
down, hold the joystick down and press the FIRE BUTTON.

Resurrections. After each crash or penalty, press the FIRE BUTTON to continue
the duel. If you run out of lives ... well, cheer up, even Rome fell. Don't
quit. Ignore the callous insults flung at you by the computer and take another
shot.

SCORE SCREENS

One or two screens that resemble Z1 and Z2 will appear after each leg of the
race is finished. When you race against the computer, the winner is determined
by the highest point total. (If your time is only slightly better than the
computer's, his speed and points may be greater than yours. The is because he
started behind you and had a slightly greater distance to travel.)

TOP GUN SCREEN

After you race, and if you have one of the seven highest on your disk, a screen
appears which asks you to type in your name. Then press the FIRE BUTTON an
you'll see your name in print. Congrats. (There are separate Top Gun screens, 
by the way, for every Scenery Disk.)

HOW TO USE THE INSTALL OPTION

This section explains you can create your own unique races using different
combinations of cars and scenery from the original game AND the optional Car and
Scenery disks.

What kind of combinations can you make? How about a Porsche RUF (top speed 211
mph) head-to-head against the new Corvette ZR1? Rocketing between a stand of
redwoods near the Oregon border, or through heavy San Francisco traffic?

To take the first step toward creating your custom match races, highlight 
INSTALL and press ENTER (or the FIRE BUTTON). You dissolve to the Install Menu
which looks something like this.

                    Install Menu

                    Exit to Game Menu

                    Car Disk
                    Scenery Disk
                    Play Disk

                    Make Play Disk
                    Copy Cars
                    Copy Scenery

                    Exit to Game Menu

WARNING!

When you swap disks, please wait until the red light on the drive goes off
before you press the fire button.

A Tip To Save Disk Swaps

After you've made a Play Disk, and you're ready to exit the Install Menu 
screen, make sure that Car Disk or Scenery Disk are not assigned to any drive
(a blank space beside them.) It'll save you much swapping grief.

Car Disk

   *  This tells the computer whether you have inserted a Car Disk into the
      drive. Highlight it, press the FIRE BUTTON, then type in the name of the
      disk or its drive location. 

   *  If you are asked to insert the Car Disk, follow all the on-screen 
      instructions.

   *  When you return to the Setup screen, choose Your Car or Other Car option.
      (If you have only one drive, you'll be prompted to insert your Car Disk;
      follow the on-screen instructions.) You can move your joystick to scroll
      through the original and new cars. Press the FIRE BUTTON when you spot
      your dream car.

Only One Disk Per Drive?

No, you can assign more than one disk to the same drive, which is particularly
important - obviously - if you have only one drive. For example, both a Car and
Scenery Disk could be specified to Drive A.

Scenery Disk

   *  This tells the computer where the Scenery Disk is located. Highlight it,
      press the FIRE BUTTON, then type in the name of the disk or its drive
      location.

   *  If you are asked to insert the Scenery Disk, follow all on-screen
      instructions.

   *  When you return to Setup screen, choose the Scenery option. (If you have
      only one drive, you'll be prompted to insert your Scenery Disk; follow
      the on-screen instructions.) Now you can move your joystick (or arrow
      keys) to scroll through the original and new scenery. Press the FIRE
      BUTTON when the roads of your dreams appear.

Play Disk

   *  This tells the computer the location of the Play Disk. Assign a drive
      for the Play Disk, then follow the on-screen instructions. What's a play
      disk? It's a formatted disk onto which you can copy some of the Master
      Disk as well as different combinations of cars and scenery. For example,
      you could create a match race between the F40 and the Corvette ZR1 in
      California. And it keeps you from having to swap disks at each gas
      station. (You must assign a drive to PLAY DISK before making a Play
      Disk.)

YOU'RE NOT CRAZY!

If you think your game is asking you to swap disks an awful lot, you're not
crazy. It is. But you can resolve the merry-go-round by creating a Play Disk.

DON'T WRITE PROTECT YOUR DISKS!

If you write protect your disks (perhaps so that you won't make a serious
mistake when swapping disks), the game won't work properly. So don't. Bruce,
the designer, built safeguards into the product (in fact, it will prompt you to
take the write protect off).

ANOTHER ESSENTIAL PLAY DISK TIP

If you want to put cars or scnery onto your Play Disk from an optional Car or
Scenery Disk, make sure that the Car or Scenery Disk is assigned to a drive on
the Install Menu before you proceed. Otherwise, you can only extract cars and
roadscapes from the Master Disk.

Make Play Disk

   *  With this option, you copy some of the Master Disk onto a formatted disk
      or your hard drive. Important: You must format your blank disk first - 
      see your Amiga manual if you need more info. Highlight, press the FIRE
      BUTTON, then follow the on-screen instructions. Now you're ready to add
      Car and Scenery information which makes the Play Disk playable - you must
      have at least one car and one scenery to make a working play disk.

Copy Cars

   *  After you make a Play Disk, this lets you copy cars from the Master Disk
      or Car Disk onto your Play Disk. (You can copy one scenery and two cars 
      to a Play Disk.) Press the FIRE BUTTON, follow the on-screen 
      instructions. and a screen appears which looks something like the diagram
      on page 13.

   *  Use your joystick to highlight the name (or names) of the car you want to
      manipulate, then press the fire button. An * will appear before each
      name to indicate that it's selected. (Press the FIRE BUTTON again to undo
      the selection.)

   *  You can only copy cars - never delete them - from the list in the first
      column. Likewise, you can only delete - never copy - cars from the
      second column list.

   *  After a car is selected, press COPY or DELETE, and follow the on-screen
      instructions.

Copy Scenery 

   *  This lets you copy scenery from the Master Disk or Scenery Disk onto your
      Play Disk. (You can copy one scenery and two cars to a Play Disk.)

   *  You can only copy scenery - never delete them - from the list in the first
      column. Likewise, you can only delete - never copy - scenery from the
      second column list.

   *  After a scenery is selected, press COPY or DELETE, and follow the 
      on-screen instructions.

   *  Use your joystick to highlight the names or names of the scenery you 
      want to manipulate, then press the FIRE BUTTON. An * will appear before
      each name to indicate that it's selected. (Press the FIRE BUTTON again to
      undo the selection.)

   *  After a scenery is selected, press COPY or DELETE, and follow the 
      on-screen instructions.

   *  After you've placed cars and scenery onto a Play Disk, go to Play Disk
      and press the FIRE BUTTON. Make sure that your Play Disk is specified to
      DF0: and press the FIRE BUTTON again. The message at the top of the screen
      should read "Using Play Disk." Then when you exit the Install Menu, be 
      sure to set the YOUR CAR, OTHER CAR, and SCENERY settings to match your
      Play Disk.

Using More Than One Disk?

Eventually, you may create a library of Play, Car, or Scenery Disks. To switch
them without turning off your computer, go to the Install Menu. Take out your
current disk out of its drive and put your new one in. Highlight PLAY DISK (or
CAR DISK or SCENERY DISK), press the FIRE BUTTON twice and you're ready to go.

One Final All-Encompassing Installation Tip

On occasion you will boot up the game (or change disks within the game), and a
message might pop up asking you to insert a Play, Car, or Scenery Disk. If you
don't want to do this, or you don't have such a disk, or you've specified the
wrong drive location, just press ESC and follow the on-screen instructions.
That should get you back into the game.
