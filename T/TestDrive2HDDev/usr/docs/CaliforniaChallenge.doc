                             CALIFORNIA CHALLENGE
                          TEST DRIVE II SCENERY DISK

                                  THE MANUAL

This promises to be among the shortest product manuals in the history of
entertainment software. In fact, it has but one instruction.

1   To find out how to install CALIFORNIA CHALLENGE into THE DUEL: TEST
    DRIVE II, see your Test Drive II manual. Pay most attention to the
    section called HOW TO USE THE INSTALL OPTION.

That's it. That's all. But what about all the space left on this paper? In
the interest of competition, we're going to fill it with a description of
each roadscape along the seven legs of C.C.

The California/Oregon Border to the Trees of Mystery - The sign says
"Welcome TO California" - but don't plan on a long stay. The race begins
at the border and immediately catapults you down a twisting redwood
highway.

Trees of Mystery to Eureka - Hold tight. The roads are as gnarled as the
trees. Handling is at a premium. The lush forest and oceanscape may be
beautiful but one errant glance could pile you head-on into a logging
truck.

Eureka to Rockport - Prepare to climb. This stretch starts off like an
elevator ride - then the bottom drops out. Definitely not for the faint of
heart. Best to keep one eye on the road and one eye on the elevation
markers.

Rockport to San Francisco - No stopping for souvenirs in the small coastal
towns. Time to make your move. Blast down 101, through the tunnel near Mill
Valley, then feast your eyes on the famous Golden Gate Bridge and city
skyline.

San Francisco to Carmel - Grab your sourdough to-go and step on it.
Infamous Devil's Slide takes no prisoners and the heavy traffic makes even
the locals sweat. Shoot past Santa Cruz and wind your way down the
Monterey peninsula.

Carmel to Santa Barbara - The view from the vistas is postcard perfect.
Trek through the towering redwoods of Big Sur, then zip by a lighthouse
off the Santa Barbara coast. No time for California Dreamin'. The
snakelike curves, narrow bridges and undulating roadway demand full
attention.

Santa Barbara to Mexico - What makes the Beach Boys sing? Take a gander out
your window. Sunny Santa Monica, Del Mar and La Jolla beach. Wave adios
to the palm trees, weave down that L.A. freeway and make a run for the
border.

Important Note #1: The mileages used in California Challenge are not the
actual number of miles from Oregon to Mexico. They are "scale" miles that
represent the exact distance.

Important Note #2: After you boot up the Master Disk for The Duel: Test
Drive II, and you want to use the Scenery Disk, you must assign the
Scenery Disk to a drive. You will then be instructed to insert your
Scenery Disk into the assigned drive. At that time, a serial number is
assigned to that disk. Once that number is assigned, Play Disks can be
created with that Scenery Disk only with the Master Disk that was in use
when the serial number was assigned.


                                THE SUPERCARS
                            TEST DRIVE II CAR DISK

                                 THE MANUAL

This promises to be among the shortest product manuals in the history of
entertainment software. In fact, it has only one instruction:

1    To find out how to install THE SUPERCARS into THE DUEL: TEST DRIVE II,
     see your Test Drive II manual. Pay most attention to the section
     called HOW TO USE THE INSTALL OPTION.

That's it. That's all. But since we have the bulk of this paper left to
fill, we've decided to fill it with a description of each of the Supercars
in the disk. Here goes.

'88 Lotus Turbo Esprit - If you're expecting typical British reserve, guess
again. This Esprit is as sensuous and aggressive as any exotic to come out
of Italy. And any car capable of pegging its 160 mph speedometer is
certainly worthy of Supercar status. The Lotus handling is world famous.
The 2.2-liter turbocharged engine, irresistible. Keep a stiff upper lip and
let Esprit's 228 horses stampede.

Ferrari Testarossa - A legend in its own time. The elite of Grand Touring
cars. This Ferrari hits 185 mph with twelve cylinders singing in perfect
harmony. 0-60 strikes in 5.3 seconds and the quarter mile blurs by a 13.3 -
well over 100 mph. But speed isn't the only thing to snap necks. Take one
look at its styling, its wrap-around leather interior - and you'll know
exactly what you'd do with $134,000.

Porsche 911 RUF - Introducing Louis Ruf's gift to the automotive world - a
custom-built, twin-turbo Porsche 911. Top speed: 211 mph. 0-60 mph: 4.0
seconds. Blindingly quick. Acceleration that sucks you into the seat.
Supreme ruler of the German Autobahn, this 469 bhp bullet is perfectly
street legal. But don't let that fool you. The space program would provide
better preparation for this experience than driving school.

'88 Lamborghini Countach 5000S - Stunning. No other word best describes
the Lamgborghini's look - or performance. How can a car so outrageous be
so so darn fast? Take a look under the hood. The Countach sports a
powerful V-12 with four valves per cylinder. Before you can say "Giotto
Bizzarrini" you're at 179 mph. And nothing can match its stability at top
speed. Go out on the open road. Count how many times "WOW" leaves your
mouth.

'89 Corvette ZR1 - Tough to keep a 185 mph Corvette under wraps but the
ZR1 stands as one of Detroit's best kept secrets. Designed with one goal:
"create the world's fastest production car." Its engine, code LT5, is a
legend before its time. An all-aluminum, four cam, 32 valve V-8 so strong
that Chevrolet engineers had to completely redo the rear end to
accomodate more rubber. Is there anything simular to the ZR1? Check out
the Indy 500.

to a drive. You will then be instructed to insert your Car Disk into the

                          THE DUEL: TEST DRIVE II
                             COMMODORE AMIGA

                                 OOOPs!

Yes, we have fallen prey to the deadly sin of omission. You might want to
read the following instructions if you're having problems following the
instructions on page 11 regarding the creation of a Play Disk. We say it's
simpler than it is, so here's the full explanation. Sorry for any
inconvenience.

1  As it states on page 11, assign the drive for the Play Disk, (i.e. DF0:),
   then press Return. This message will appear: "Insert Play Disk in DF0:,
   Press button to continue"


2  Insert a blank formatted disk into the drive and press the button.
   Another message will appear that states: "DF0: is not a Play Disk. Press
   Press button to continue. Esc to cancel."

3  If you want to use a Play Disk that you've already created, insert that
   disk, press the fire button, then follow the on-screen instructions.
   If you want to create a new Play Disk, Press Esc, and this message
   appears: "Select 'Make Play Disk' to make this disk into a Play Disk."

4  Select Make Play Disk on screen, press the button, then follow the
   on-screen instructions to create the Play Disk.
