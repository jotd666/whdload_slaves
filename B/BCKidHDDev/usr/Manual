BC KID


The story
---------
You play BC Kid, a little fella who must rescue the princess (yuk!).  But
before he can do so, he must battle through 5 levels of shear frustration and
madness.  BC Kid must destroy or dodge the enemies that are littered around
the levels.  The object of each level, is to complete it.  Each level has
between 4-6 sub levels, with 3 diffrent bonus stages.  At the end of each
level is a guardian (yawn!), you must find the guardians weakness, and keep
hitting the guardian.  Once you have defeated the guardian, it will change
into the creature it used to be, and they will give you a clue for the
following level.  Once you have beaten all the guardians, you must do battle
with the mother of all guardians, and then, and only then may you rescue the
princess and fly away home.
