 Requirements:
 -------------
 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path.
 These programs can be found in the WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 Note: This install cannot be used with the game (extended ADF) image provided

 History:
 --------
 
 version 1.5 (16.08.2019) done by JOTD:
 - added option to force 2nd button = jump (CUSTOM2=1 as always)
 - added joypad controls for pause, give up current game, quit to wb & levelskip.
 - shuffled the CUSTOMx flags to respect my personal logic (custom1=trainer,
   custom2=2nd button jumps, customx: other)
 - fixed lockup bug when saving hiscores/options with trainer on
 
 version 1.4 (06.03.17) done by JOTD
 - added trainer: infinite lives / select number of lives / select start level
 - Press F1 to skip levels, F2 to skip stages
 - hiscore won't be saved if trainer is enabled
 
 version 1.3 (17.03.14) done by Wepl
 - interrupt acknowledge and smc in the TFMX player code fixed
 - decruncher optimized, should be a bit faster now
 - HudsonSoft/Factor5 logos can be skipped using Custom1 now
 - disk image shortend a bit, if you want to have this either reinstall or
   manually set the filesize to 1022536, you can also leave the old image as
   it still works
 - WHDLoad v17 is now required due Custom1 control
 - thanks to Retro-Nerd for report and testing (issue #2967) although this
   update doesn't really fix the mentioned problems

 Cheats/Hints
 ------------
 Jump up and turn on the autofire on your joystick. You'll glide through
 the air while spinning madly. This should help you dodge all the dinosaurs
 and volcanoes.

 Select 'OPTIONS' from the title screen. On the option screen, use and
 enter the following sequence: UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT.
 Now start the game and infinite lives are yours.

 Note that if you enable levelskip or infinite lives trainer, highscores
 won't be saved.

 There's an access fault on "continue play" on WinUAE if "more compatible" isn't checked
 I (JOTD) haven't fixed this as it was non-trivial and probably winuae only.
