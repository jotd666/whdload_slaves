 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly

 version 2.2 (30-12-2018):
 - fixed freeze issue in the title screen on 68000/cycle exact (issue #0004028)
 - improved keyboard handling (removed dubious write to CIAA_SDR in the game)
 
 version 2.1-B (25-12-2018):
 - fixed install script which installed the old version... (issue #0004007)
 
 version 2.1 (10-06-2018):
 - Added quitkey in ECS version (issue #0003873). Strange as kickemu slaves are supposed to handle
   that automatically, well this game is special I guess... or blocks level 2 interrupt
 
 version 2.0 (08-05-2018):
 - Fixed ECS/AGA slave mixup,now ECS version runs on 512 chip & 68000 (issue #0002599)
 - Added splash option to select 1-button joystick (default is 2-button), forces 1-button
   even if CD32 pad is connected
 - On all 3 versions: fixed 2-button mode with standard joystick (thanks Toni for the help with WinUAE)
 - ECS/AGA version: CD32 mode is also compatible with 2-joystick button
 
 version 1.2-B (14.08.07)
 - added manual (provided by Luca)

 version 1.2 (27.01.06) done by JOTD:
 - fixed annoying pause+ESC freeze restart bug (all versions)
 
 version 1.1 (04.01.04)
 - another AGA version supported (Amiga Computing Coverdisk)
 - reworked for WHDLoad v16
 - now compatible with A1200 and A4000 kickstarts

 version 1.0 (17.07.03) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - CD³² version supported
 - disk protection removed on floppy version (Thanks Mark Knibbs)
 - access fault removed on floppy version
 - VBR accesses removed
 - nice icons by CFou!/Chris Vella
 - source code included

 bugs:
 
 - I was not able to make 2-button joystick work properly in all versions at
   least for my Wico joystick. Works for a CD³² controller. There seems to
   exist a limitation with some 2-button joysticks.
