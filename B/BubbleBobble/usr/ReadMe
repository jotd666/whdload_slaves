For those of you that are curious, here are the differences I have found
between the 4 known versions:

SPS 1342: No credits on title screen, insufficient memory allocated for 
          "asprites.spr" file, buggy end of game guardian (16x16 blocks 
          sometimes vanish when you hit him and the final bubble he is
          trapped in is sometimes corrupt), slow firing bubble speed,
          music plays faster, credits screen replaced, Rob Northen copylock 
          contained in "snd" file

The other 3 versions are basically the same and have these features:
          Credits appear on the title screen, bubbles fire faster, end of 
          game guardian works correctly, slower music, Protec copy 
          protection contained in the executable

SPS 1343: Fully encrypted file (Rob Northen copylock, Protec disabled)
SPS 1344: No copy-protection (Protec disabled)
SPS 2518: Protec copy protection is checked

I would guess that SPS 1342 was the first version released, then a few bugs
were fixed and the copylock replaced with Protec copy-protection for SPS 
2518. SPS 1343 looks like a re-release with the best protection of all, and
then another final release containing no copy-protection for SPS 1344. Phew!

If you are upgrading from the old install, it is recommended you re-install
the game completely since the old script copied the executable from one
version.

It is highly recommended to play this game in NTSC mode as it is a lot
faster and smoother!

Greetings to Frank for the nice icons, Mad-Matt for constant nagging to
finish this release :) all Action members, Wepl and the entire WHDLoad
team!
