 The AGA game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.

 The game requires an installed A600, A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40063.A600", "kick40068.A1200", or kick40068.A4000. 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.

 an appropriate requester.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.1-B (26.04.2020):
 - (ECS only) fixed cornercase bug in kickemu selection for 68000
 
 version 2.1 (23.04.2020):
 - ECS version now compatible with 68000 (issue #0004527). Original game
   doesn't run with kickstart 1.3 (uses V36/V37 system calls) so
   you'll have to get hold of the A600 3.1 kickstart rom to use it on a 68000
 - nothing much done for AGA version, just rebuilt with latest kickemu
 
 version 2.0 (02.05.04)
 - fixed save/load problems (reinstalling would be better)
 - added ECS version support
 - adapted to WHDLoad v16
 - source code included

 version 1.1 (16.07.03)
 - fixed "insert disk 4" requester problem. Sorry for that, v1.0 was unusable

 version 1.0 (07.07.03) done by JOTD:
 - initial release

Note: The installation copies 20 savegames in order to avoid OS swaps.
If you still experiment trouble after saving a game (OS swaps -> flickering menu)
just press any key and it will return to normal behaviour.
