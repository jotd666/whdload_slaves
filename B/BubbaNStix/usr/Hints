Hints/Level codes (from Abaddon's Sweetcheater)

    On the beginning of level one, turn around and face the tree that
    follows you.  Get close to the tree and jump up and throw your
    stick over it.  Now when you land turn around and the stick will
    hit the tree a couple of times.  If the tree is still there repeat
    the previous steps, and the tree will eventually turn into a tiny
    tree.  Now go to the left and pick up all of the stuff.  Make sure
    you get the unicycle like thing with the head on it.  Now you
    should notice platforms have appeared throughout the level.  Get
    all the stuff that is on the platforms.  When you finish the level,
    you will be transported to a bonus level.
