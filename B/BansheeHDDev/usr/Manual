When the megalomanical alien dictator of the incredibly evil Styx Empire 
decides to Take over the world, only one man has the guts and the inventive 
genius to stand in his way: Sven Svardensvart - inventor, ace pilot, 
square-jawed hero and all-round good guy.



 

The place is Earth.  The year, 1999, but the Earth of a different timeline, 
where the last two World Wars were never fought and aviation technology 
hasn't advanced beyond the power-propped plane.  There are no microwave 
ovens and TV  is still in black and white. (MG: It sounds like Wales!?) 
There are no  Superpowers.  Humankind lives peacefully- until... Blardax 
Maldrear, uglier than a Phreenian Foot-toad and the exquisitely evil alien 
emperor of the Styx  Empire, has an exquisitely evil idea.. Wouldn't it be 
great (he thinks), if the  exquisitely evil Styx Empire covered every last 
millimetre of good old planet  Earth?

The invasion begins - and only one man stands in the way of Blardax's 
relentless lust for world domination - his name: Sven Svardensvart...

Sven escapes to the last free place on Earth and swiftly builds and 
incredible flying machine, bristling with guns, rockets and other deadly 
weapons.  He  calls this plane the 'Banshee' - and thus begins his one 
man rebellion against  the exquisitely evil technological might of the 
Styxian invaders.


 

Banshee begins with a brief Introductory Sequence, followed by the Core 
Design logo.  Next, the Banshee logo will appear followed by the Banshee 
Main Menu Title screen.  If you wait a moment, you will see a short 
demonstration of the game which you may want to watch to get an idea of 
what to expect.  If you decide to skip this screen and go to the Main Menu, 
press the Fire button at any time.

The Main Menu gives you the choice of starting a New Game or going to the 
Options screen to change the game settings.  Use the Joystick to move up 
or down the list and press the Fire button to make your selection.


 

This is the screen where you can change the basic set-up of the game.

PLAYER 1 USES:  Select to choose control method for player 1.  You have
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  the choice of Mouse, 1-Button Joystick or 2-Button Joystick.

NOTE: player 1's controller is plugged into port 2.

PLAYER 2 USES:  Select to choose control method for player 1.  You have
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  the choice of Mouse, 1-Button Joystick or 2-Button Joystick.

Keep players on screen (ON/OFF): This will allow you - in 2-player mode only 
- to choose whether or not you want to allow the Banshee planes to  move 
off-screen when both planes are moving away from each other, horizontally.

DIFFICULTY LEVEL:  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
There are three difficulty levels in Banshee - Easy, Normal & Hard.  With
Easy selected, it will only be possible to play the first 2 levels and you
wont be able to enter your name in the High Score List.  With Normal or 
Hard selected, you can play all 4 levels.

SPLIT POWER UPS (ON/OFF): 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Only select for a 2-player game.  In the 2-player version of Banshee, the 
Pick Up icons will usually appear in pairs.  There are two ways in which 
you can collect them.  Select ON and the icons appear in two colours, you 
will only be able to collect the Pick Up which corresponds to your player 
colour.  Select OFF and the icons appear in one colour, they can then be  
collected by either player - allowing you to seriously annoy your friend 
by grabbing both Pick Ups before him/her.


 

You, as the player, take control of the heroic Sven Svardensvart as he flies 
his Banshee fighter-plane against the might of the exquisitely evil alien 
invaders.  At any time during combat, a second player can  join in by simply 
pressing the fire button (if a joystick is fitted) or the left mouse button 
(if using a mouse).  Player 2 will then immediately take control of a 
second Banshee fighter and assist Sven in his attack on the incredibly 
malevolent and not-at-all-nice Styx  Empire.
