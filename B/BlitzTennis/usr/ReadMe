 This install applies to "Blitz Tennis / Center Court" © 1997 Gernot Fritsche

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").
 
 The AGA game requires 2MB chip and an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The ECS game requires 0.5 MB chip and an installed A600 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 
 The game requires an installed A600, A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40063.A600", "kick40068.A1200", or kick40068.A4000. 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40063.A600.RTB","kick40068.A1200.RTB" or
 "kick40068.A4000.RTB" must be installed in the same directory as the
 kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.
 
 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.0 (31.07.2021) done by JOTD:
 - VBR accesses removed
 - 2 versions of the slave provided. ECS and AGA (graphics are completely
   different)
   
Supports version SPS2765

The game autodetects AGA chipset. 2 slaves are provided. You can run the ECS slave
on an AGA computer and benefit from lower-end graphics :)

The ECS version can be run on a OCS 68000 computer using A600 version of 3.1 ROM.

Both slaves can run on the same dataset. It's just that the install script doesn't install
both simultaneously (too lazy to do that) but you can do it manually to have both versions
sharing the same "data" dir.
