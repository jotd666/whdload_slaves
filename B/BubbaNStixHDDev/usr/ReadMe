 This install applies to "Bubba'N'Stix" © 1993 Core Design

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem for the floppy
 version, 2.0 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem for the CD³² version

 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 3.0 (12.01.2021) done by JOTD:
 - added proper joypad controls (floppy & cd32)
 - cd32 version now no longer requires kick3.1 to run, now both use 1.3
 - fixed classic 2-button controls for standard joystick (issue #0004907)
 - added levelskip
 - option to skip intro (CUSTOM5, cd32 version)
 - adapted to whdload 17
 - installer script rewritten
 - source code included
 
 version 2.2 (01.01.2003) done by JOTD:
 - CD³² version supported
 - Installer script rewritten

 version 2.1
 - the end of level 1 boss bug was a protection problem, now fixed.

 version 2.0
 - first WHDLoad/KickDOS version. Works better than the OSEmu version

 version 1.x
 - my JST install and Bored Seal WHDLoad installs: uses OSEmu, and fails
   on continues screen and at the end-of-level boss

joypad controls (alternate):

- fire: swat stix
- blue: jump
- yellow: launch stix
- forward+reverse: quit current game
- play: pause (fire to resume)
- fwd+green: skip current level
- fwd+rev+yellow: quit to workbench

note that alternate controls option only works with a cd32 joypad since yellow is used
to launch stix. With a 2-button joystick use the 2 button option (which is different between floppy
and cd32 version: button 2 launches stix in the floppy version, and jumps in the cd32 version, whereas
pressing fire longer launches stix)

files "bubba" and "intro" (cd32 only) must be unpacked for the game to run properly
This is done by the installer script (you need xfddecrunch). If the game quits with
"unsupported version", that probably means that that decrunch part has been skipped.
