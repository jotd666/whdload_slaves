 This install applies to "Buck Rogers XXVc: Countdown to Doomsday" © 1990 TSR.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

Notes:

* First time you run the installed game, the screen remains black for 10 seconds and
  HD is accessed. This is perfectly normal. Savegames are created empty in order to
  avoid OS swaps when you load/save a game.
* This is beta, I spent already too much time on it, but I know there are bugs in the
  original game; If you experiment crashes during fights (the original game did GURU),
  please try to save the game just before a point where you suspect that it could
  happen, and send it to me. I may be able to figure the problem out.
* you NEED to install the game using the original HD installer before you can
  use this patch (this is because the executable is unpacked during the original
  install and I have no idea how it is done, so I leave it like this, since it works)
* Once installed, the game can be moved anywhere else, archived, etc... because the
  pathName file problem (containing original installation path) has been fixed.
  The game also used the "assign" command to set some assign, which is no longer needed
  now, so the simplest way was to create a dummy assign program, which does nothing.
* I hope Jonhatan will be happy about this one, and maybe a dozen of other people :)
