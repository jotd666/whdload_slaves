 This install applies to "Black Dawn II" © 1994 Andrew Campbell

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 
 The game requires an installed A600, A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp. "kick40068.A4000", or "kick40063.A600"). The image can be extracted from a A1200 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200/A4000.RTB" or "kick40063.A600.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.0 (07.06.2020) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - removed floppy-dependent code: now able to save to hard drive
 - integrated Ross fix to fix random crash
 - original & Ross fixed versions supported

notes:

- The game (at least Ross fixed version) worked with "generic" kickemu, but was unable to
  save games, because first it was directly addressing DF0 and DF1 in assigns,
  and more annoyingly it checked for floppy state using hardware banging. Once
  the banging was simulated by injecting the proper values in crap underoptimized
  AMOS code, it just worked.
   
- using kickstart 1.3 seems to work at first, but for instance instruction text is
  completely trashed, so it looks that it will be difficult to make it work. Game
  still can run on a 68000 provided that the A600 3.0 kickstart is used
