                       STAND BY FOR A NEW KIND OF HERO.

                     FASTER THAN A CHARGING HIPPOPOTAMUS.

                       SMARTER THAN A PHYs ED STUDENT.

                     SMOOTHER THAN GARY GLITTER`s BONCE.

                        HE IS THE KING OF THE JUNGLE.

                         THE LORD OF ALL THE BEASTS.

                          AND HIS MUM NAMED HIM....

                                  STORYLINE
                                  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

       Brian lives in the jungle on an island off the coast of Africa.
            Most days he spends doing the things that your average
      Lord of all the beasts gets up to.  Taking cat-naps in the shade,
             picking big juicy fleas out of his mane and chewing
                the fat with his best pal, Chris the Crystal.


         But inevitably that cosy idyll has been rudely interrupted.
            A big, ugly monster named Geeza - whose chief hobbies 
      are squeezing zits,and listening to dodgy guitar-based rock bands
                           ( sounds like Skuz !! )
                  has kidnapped Chris !  Geeza wants to use 
             Chris`s prismatic powers to hypnotise all the jungle
               creatures and crown himself king of the beasts.


             Armed only with his mighty roar and a dazzling pair
           of Bermuda shorts, Brian has to take on wave after wave
            of Geeza`s brainwashed followers and cross the island 
             in order to save his pal and the rest of the animals
             from being ruled by a monster of severely restricted
            musical taste.  And anyway, Brian liked being king of
                 the jungle.  It helped him pull the babes !!

                                   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

   UP - This makes brian jump.  The longer you push it, the higher he jumps.
        Under water it makes him swim.   ( pussy paddle ?? )

   DOWN - This makes Brian crouch.

   RIGHT - This makes Brian move right.

   LEFT - Go on, have a guess !!

   FIRE - Brian gives his enemies a claws out super swipe.

   SPACE BAR - Press this to pause the game and select Brian`s special moves.
               Once selected, the move lasts until the end of the level :

           RAJAR ROAR - The noise from this is so deafening that it even
                        scares Brian !  The roar can either stun Brian`s
                        opponents or blow them off screen altogether.

           SPLENDID SPEED - This turns Brian into Lionford Christie.

           JINORMOUS JUMP - Use this to get to those places that ordinary
                            jumps just can`t reach.
 
                    Press SPACE BAR again to resume game.

                                THE CLOUD SHOP
                                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯  
   
   At certain stages throughout the game Brian can stock up on supplies at the
  cloud shop. This Puff-tastic retail emporium can provide Brian with much
  needed continues, extra lives, hit points and special powers which are
  essential to success in the crusade against Geeza.  But nothing comes free
  in the jungle so make sure you have plenty of crystal spondoolies !

===============================================================================

                                BONUS LEVELS.
                                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 

   If you manage to beat the time limit set at the start of the level Brian
  has the chance to test his mettle in the three bonus worlds:- LIQUID LAND,
  CRYSTAL KINGDOM and SKY HIGH WORLD.  Simply use the joystick to select
  Brian`s destination and then hit the button.  Then it`s a race against the
  clock to reach the finish - you have only 1 hit point so the motto is more
  speed, less haste.  Complete all three bonus levels and Brian gets a
  bodacious reward, maximum special abilities on all counts ! But be warned -
  these levels are no picnic.
   At the half way point in the game (if you manage to outsmart Graham the
  Gorilla ) there is a special shoot em up stage where Brian rides around on a
  duck and engages in a crabtastic crustacean-decimating blasterama !!!
   There`s no time limit here - just keep an eye out for those pincers!!

                          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

   Occasionally throughout the game Brian will encounter TONY THE TORNADO.  If
  Brian steps into the twister he will be swept off his feet and whisked to a
  secret level !  These usually contain far more goodies than the standard
  levels and are great for building up Brian`s abilities.  Tony can be found
  on the levels marked with a blue dot - those marked with orange dots contain
  only ordinary exits.
