 This install applies to "Beneath A Steel Sky"  1993-1994 Virtual Theatre/Virgin.

 This install is designed for the floppy versions (15 disks) & CD남 version.
  
 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 Floppy version:

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem (12 MB with PRELOAD)

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

  Version 2.2 (08.05.2021) done by JOTD:
  - allows CD32 version to run on a 68000/68010 machine (issue #0005141). You
    will need the 3.1 A600 kickstart which supports 68000 CPU.

  Version 2.1 (03.02.2019) still done by JOTD:
  - fixed a bug in the sound replay (CD남): program is now loaded in fast memory,
    but some sound routine relied on the fact that it was in chipmem (music & sfx worked,
	but the "beep" sound at start was funny, and there were also parasite sounds). It was some
	hard work to find this. Thanks to Toni for the new "wrong memory write to DMA registers" in WinUAE
  - floppy version bump, with just some source code rework & reassembled with newest kickemu, added
    WHDLF_ClearMem flag because the game seems to read "in the woods" sometimes, better read 0 than trash.
  
  Version 2.0 (06.02.2005)
  - reworked for WHDLoad v16 & kickemu, smaller slave, loads faster, less OS swaps
  - CD남 version support (Thanks Bert for ISO), with program loading in fast memory (fast load)
    (hard work because I had to relocate some chip-only data in chip, check the source!)
 - reworked readme & install script

  Version 1.1 (01.04.2003)
  - After load access fault removed
  - Source code included (needs kick13.s & kickdos stuff)

  Version 1.0 (22.09.2001) done by JOTD
  - Initial release 
  - Runs fully from HD using WHDLoad/KickEmu/KickDOS
  - LINC terminal problems fixed (the english version of the game crashed)
  - Game file provided in order to avoid gfx corruption at Dr Burke's
  - No more crash on "Restart" option
  - OS Swaps avoided when loading/saving a game
  - Convenient install script
  - Full use of fast memory
  - Menu access faults removed
  - All versions are supported (tested with english, french, swedish, german versions)
  - LINC Password protection removed (thanks to Mark Knibbs for AmigaPatchList)
  - Quit key (numerical '*', or configurable with QUITKEY)
  - Walkthrough included
  - Wide choice of icons provided

Notes

  - As in the original DOS release, use F5/F6 to save/load games.
  - Due to a bug in the original release, "Restart" option has been
    changed so now program loads first game (game0).
    If you did not save any game here, restart will just quit the game.
    The best thing to do to make "restart" work is to save the game at
    the very beginning (when you're in the press room with the cop)
    under position 0.
  - You need a lot of memory (about 12MB) to run that game using WHDLoad
    because of the data files.
  - Once, I experienced a game freeze (original game bug, I think). Don't forget
    to save your games from time to time...
  - I finally fixed the problem with LINC terminal: once you gained access to
    a pirate ID card, the retina scan allows you to enter the 6-digit code
    (which is now bypassed, fortunately :)). After that code, some LINC menu
    crashed the machine. Actually, it only worked on a 24 bit CPU (68000, 68010
    or 68020).
  - I would like to thank all the people who sent me their versions of the
    executable, and also pseudo-fix packages for it (good but not enough :))
    and especially Olivier Schott for completing the game with this slave
    (he used the french version).
  - Due to the size of the game, the long introduction, the amount of bugs,
    and the tests, this install was very time consuming.
    I hope you'll appreciate it.
  - The CD32 version was recently adapted to be 68000 friendly. A 68000 can't
    cope with more than 16MB so the talkie version can't be preloaded but at
    least it will work (with flashes but will work)
