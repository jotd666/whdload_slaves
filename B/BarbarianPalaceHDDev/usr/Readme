 This install applies to "Barbarian" (c) 1988 Palace Software
 Original supplied by Mark Knibbs!

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing PrtScr (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500".  The image can be extracted from an A500
 with tools like "GrabKick" or similar which can be found on Aminet.  If the
 image is the wrong version or altered in any way, WHDLoad will quit with an
 appropriate error message.

 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image.  It can be found in the archive
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on Aminet.
 
 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.1 (12/03/2017) done by JOTD 
 - adapted to WHDLoad v17
 - reassembled with new kickemu (fixes issue #003520 for 68000 CPUs)
 - source code included
 - removed restrictions for registered users
 
 version 1.0
 - Full load from HD
 - Copy protection removed (encryption/checksum/disk check)
 - Access faults fixed (x2)
 - RomIcon, NewIcon and OS3.5 Colour Icons (created by Frank and myself!) 
  and 2 Exoticons (taken from http://exotica.fix.no)
 - Quit option (default key is 'F10')
 
 
Finally this slave is finished! I have seen a few people that have
knocked up a generic slave using a cracked disk image for this game but
every single one of them quit as soon as the high score table disappears
because of access faults. The only way around that was to use NOMMU type
flags and by then, who knows what memory had become corrupt!

This version fixes the access faults so it should run perfectly without
any hacks on all Amigas!



Thanks to Mark for the original, Frank for his superb icons, Wepl for the
superb Kickstart 1.3 interface, all Action members and the WHDLoad team!
