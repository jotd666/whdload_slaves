 This install applies to "Black Dawn Rebirth" © 2019 Doublesided Games

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 2.0 MB OtherMem.
 
 The game requires an installed A600, A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp. "kick40068.A4000", or "kick40063.A600"). The image can be extracted from a A1200 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200/A4000.RTB" or "kick40063.A600.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.1 (18.05.2021) done by JOTD:
 - removed hardware banging in-game NTSC change that trashes display on exit.
   PAL users: either add NTSC tooltype / start with NTSC switch or play in PAL.
   Note: intro used to run in PAL mode and game switches to NTSC... Ugly.
 - changed icon to original icon of this game
 
 version 1.0 (14.05.2021) done by JOTD:

 - source code included
