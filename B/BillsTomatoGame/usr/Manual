       THE LEADING FORCE - GIVES YOU - THE DOX  TO - BILL TOMATO GAME
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

LETS KETCHUP WITH THE STORY SO FAR..
------------------------------------
WE JOIN TERRY TOMATO SQUOPPING (THE TOMATO EQUIVALENT OF HOPPING) UP AND
DOWN IN ANGER. YEAH OK. SO TRACY WAS`NT EVERYBODYS IDEA OF THE PERFECT TO
DIVE INTO A SALAD WITH. OK, SO SHE WAS A LITTLE TOO SAUCY WITH THE BOYS.
BUT THAT DID`NT MATTER . ALL THAT WAS BEHIND HER NOW BECAUSE SHE WAS TERRYS
GIRLFRIEND AND THEY LOVED EACH OTHER.

AND SO TERRY SET OFF IN HOT PURSUIT DETERMINED TO TRACK DOWN THE EVIL
SQUIRREL WHO HAD TOMATONAPPED TRACY AND SQUOP UP AND DOWN ON HIS HEAD TO
BRING HIM TO JUICESTICE, WHEREVER THAT MAY BE. HE SQUOPPED UP ONTO THE
FIRST BRACH AND WAS SO HASSLED BY A LOW FLYING WASP THAT HE TUMBLED BACK TO
THE GROUND AGAIN. MUCH MORE OF THAT,HE THOUGHT, AND I`LL BE PUREE.

AND WITH THAT THOUGHT, WE JOIN THE GAME...A FURIOUS TERRY SEIZES UP THE
VINE AND ATTEMPTS TO SCALE ITS LOWER BRANCHES...

WHATS ROUND & RED AND OUT FOR REVENGE?
--------------------------------------
NO ITS NOT A POLITICIAN ON A POGO STICK,ALTHOUGH IT COULD VERY WELL HAVE
BEEN. IT IS IN FACT OUR FRIEND TERRY WHO`S DIFFICULT QUEST IS TO RESCUE
TRACY FROM THE EVIL CLAWS OF SAMMY SQUIRREL. TO DO THIS. HE HAS TO CLIMB
SAMMY VINE.

THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THIS IS NO ORDINARY VINE, FOR HIDDEN AMONGST THE
BRACNHES ARE SEVERAL (10) ACTUALLY MYSTERIOUS WORLDS. ALL OF WHICH CONTAIN
TRAPS,PUZZLES AND CONUNDRUMS FOR OUR FLESHY FREIND TO CONQUER. YES INDEEDY
I HOPE TERRY`S GOT HIS RUNNING SHOES TO HAND BECAUSE TO GET THROUGH THIS
MAZE HE`S GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE!

DIFFICULT YOU MAY THINK. THE WORD IMPOSSIBLE WITH 3!!! MAY EXPLODE FROM
YOUR LIPS. OR IT MAY NOT. BUT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE SAVING GRACE AND THATS
THE LITTLE COLLECTION OF HANDY TOOLS THAT TERRY CARRIES FROM SCREEN TO
SCREEN. A FLURRY OF FANS, A TROUPE OF TRAMPOLINES TOGETHER WITH JACK-IN-THE
BOXES AND PARCELS LET TERRY BOUND AND SQUOP ACROSS EACH LAND IN SEARCH OF
HIS DEAR HEART OR TRACY AT LEAST!. AND REST ASSURED THAT ALL THE SCREENS
MAY BE TRAVERSED USING ONLY THIS SMALL SELECTION OF TOOLS - THOUGH AT TIMES
YOU`LL WANDER HOW.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME
----------------------
EACH LEVEL CONTAINS A STARTING SPRING BOARD WHICH GIVES YOU AN INITIAL
BOOST. BUT FROM THEN ON,ITS DOWN TO YOUR FANS AND TRAMPOLINES. GET SAFELY
ON THE CONVEYOR BELT AND YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT SCREEN WITH A PRESS TO THE
MOUSE BUTTON. MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH 10 LANDS. EACH WITH 10 LEVELS,AND
RESCUE YOUR SWEETHEART - THAT IS IF SAMMY SQUIRREL HAS`NT DONE AWAY WITH
HER AND TURNED HER INTO PIZZA RELISH!

ON THE WAY,WATCH OUT FOR BONUS SCREENS AND TREASURE WHICH ALLOW YOU TO BUMP
UP YOUR SCORE TO A SUPER-HUMAN LEVEL. PLUS YOU MAY DISCOVER SEVERAL WEIRD
AND WONDERFUL DEVICES. SUCH AS HYPERSPACE HOLES. PRESSURE PADS AND
ANTI-GRAVITY SCREENS. THAT HELP YOU COMPLETE AN OTHERWISE IMPOSSIBLE LEVEL.
A HANDY HINT ON LATER SCREENS TO LOOK WHERE THE TREASURE IS POSITIONED
BECAUSE IT INDICATES THE MOST SUITABLE PATH ACROSS.

TOMATOES CAN CLIMB TREES!!
--------------------------
OH YES THEY CAN!!!!
OH NO THEY CAN`T!!!
OF COURSE THEY CAN. THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY GRACEFUL WHEN THEY GET THERE.AND
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY GET THERE,JUMP HIGHER OR BOUNCE OVER SCREEN
NASTIES,THEN JUST LOOK AT YOUR FANTASTIC BOOKMARK..(WHICH YOU AINT GOT..ITS
A PIRATE RIGHT!)

BUT ONE HANDY TIP TO REMEMBER IS THAT EVERYTHING WORKS QUITE LOGICALLY AND
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT COMING FROM A COMPANY THAT THINKS EMOTIONALLY
DISTURBED TOMATOES WHO JUMP UP TREES ARE QUITE NORMAL. YOU`LL BELIEVE
ANYTHING.HOWEVER,PLACE A FAN AT THE TOP OF A JUMP AND YOU`LL MOVE FURTHER
THAN IF YOU ZOOMED PAST IT.LIKEWISE,TRY TO JUMP ONTO A TRAMPOLINE FROM TOO
GREAT A HEIGHT, AND YOU`LL FIND TERRY A REALISTICALLY SQUASHY CHAP.

OR ALTERNATIVELY, JUST IGNORE ALL INSTRUCTIONS AND WORK BY TRIAL AND ERROR
ALTHOUGH BE WARNED, YOU MIGHT FIND MORE ERROR THAN TRIAL.

THE RADIO AND SAMS VINE
-----------------------
WHEN YOU FIRST LOAD TOMATOES, YOU`LL DISCOVER A FABULOUS RADIO BLASTING OUT
SERIOUS SOUNDS, IF YOUR INTO PEACE AND QUIET HOWEVER, CLICK ON THE BUTTON
TO THE LEFT OF THE `SOUND AND FX` BOX AND YOU`LL HAVE MORE SILENCE THAN YOU
CAN SHAKE A STICK AT.

THE PASSWORD WINDOW IS THERE TO ALLOW YOU EASY ACCESS TO ALL THE SCREEN -
ONCE YOU HAVE COMPLETED A SCREEN A PASSWORD IS GIVEN WHICH SHOULD BE NOTED
DOWN, CLICK ONTO THE NOB ON THE LEFT OF THE PASSWORD WINDOW AND KEY IN THE
PASSWORD. THE WINDOW WILL THEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMAND, TELL YOU WHICH
THEME AND LEVEL YOU`VE SELECTED AND THEN, HEY PRESTO! YOU`LL FIND YOURSELF
WARPED TO THE SCREEN.

ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU START AT THE BEGINNING, JUST CLICK ONTO GO AND OFF
YOU ZOOM, INTO BILLS FABULOUS TOMATOE WONDERLAND...

THE FIRST SCREEN YOU`LL SEE A NOTERIOUS VINE. YOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO GET
TERRY UP THE VINE AFTER EVIL SAM.HOWEVER, ALONG THE WAY,YOU`LL SEE ON
SCREEN NASTIES AND WORLD SYMBOLS. AVOID OR SQUASH THE NASTIES AND TRY TO
GET INTO THE WORLD SYMBOL TO ENTER THE LEVEL - THE FIRST IS TOYLAND
INDICATED BY BUILDING BLOCKS AND HAS A RED ARROW POINTING TO IT.

ONCE YOU`VE COMPLETED 10 LEVELS, ANOTHER WORLD SYMBOL APPEARS ONE OR 2
BRANCHES UP FOR YOU TO CONTINUE ON YOUR JOURNEY,SIMPLE AINT IT?

MOUSY-MOUSY
