 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly

 version 2.1 (21.11.2020)
 - NTSC version supported (finally). issue #0004856
   I think I had this version at some point but just lost it or dropped the
   support a long time ago. Now thanks to modern tools I'm able to adapt
   it more easily (having notepad++ and 2 monitors help a lot)
 - added trainer: infinite time, infinite retries, help skips (existed but now must be enabled)
   (scores won't be saved if either is set)
 
 version 2.0 (17.04.2020) done by JOTD:
 - removed last sneaky time-bomb code checksum (issue #0000973)
 - empty dbf loops fixed in intro (music should be better)
 - SMC code removed (caused crashes on WinUAE)
 - Name bug fixed (Bill Tomato's -> Bill's Tomato)

 version 1.1 (09.04.2005)
 - HELP key now skips levels
 - "this is an illegal copy of bill tomatos game" message removed
 - empty dbf loops fixed (music should be better)

 version 1.0 (01.01.2005) done by JOTD:
 - now imager uses a RawDIC slave
 - save/load games/hiscores from HD
 - password protection removed (and many code checksums!!)
 - copperlist color bits added
 - documentation included
 - a lot of icons added
 - source code included

 version 0.9 (2001)
 - initial WHDLoad release

 version 0.x (1998)
 - initial JST release

This game has 3 "this is an illegal copy of..." message. One in the intro, one hidden in plain sight
in the main game, and one hidden in some encrypted code that reveals itself after having completed a
level and trying another one. At some point, when a checksum doesn't match, the program changes
some code, and the code activates itself later. Of course the program that changes the code is loaded
dynamically at some point, it's not in the main code... Well, thanks to WinUAE and mantis reporters I
could reproduce and fix this last issue.

another rather complete set of passwords (thanks to http://www.ollivision.de/ch/b/billstom.htm):

The first column seems to match version SPS 1748 which is the PAL version, and also seems to
work with the NTSC version (except for some that doesn't work like at all...)
I fixed some typos in the passwords. If one password doesn't work, just enter the previous one and press HELP
to get it :)
