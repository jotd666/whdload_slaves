Do not use the flag NOWRITECACHE with this game or it will lock up after
saving the high scores.

The copy protection and encryption in this game was quite interesting but
eventually it succumbed! If you think you're a legend at this game, try it
with caches enabled on a grunty Amiga :)

Greetings to Wolfgang, Adrian and Carlo for the original, Carlo and Frank for 
testing, all Action members and the WHDLoad team!
