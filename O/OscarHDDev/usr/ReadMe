 That install applies to "Oscar"  1993 Flair Software. Supported are two
 different floppy AGA versions, the floppy ECS version, the CD남 version and the CD남 Oscar/Diggers-Bundle.

 That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 You need 2 MB ChipMem and the AGA chipset for AGA & CD32 versions, and
 0.5 MB Chipmem for the ECS version.
 
 You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with	Tooltype 
 "QuitKey=").
 
 If you have problems with this installation please try first to get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad's WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also doesn't succeeds inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad's WWW-Page.

 version 2.4 (15.04.2020):
 - ECS: oops quitkey crashes on 68000 (issue #0004494)
 
 Version 2.3 (14.04.2020) done by JOTD:
 - ECS version: Exit key fixed to work on 68000 (issue #0004465)
 - ECS version: CD32 joypad support to pause game.
 - ECS version: "up" wasn't disabled when second button was used to jump
 
 Version 2.2 (08.04.2020) done by JOTD:
 - support for ECS version with same features (trainer, 2nd button jump...) (issue #0003886)
 - reduced audio dma delay (audio still okay) which fixes main sprite glitch
   on some fast machines (issue #0001181)
 
 Version 2.1 (04.04.2020) done by JOTD:
 - option to jump with blue/second button (issue #0004276)
 - added trainer: "easy mode": instant kill of enemies instead of hitting them 3 times
   which makes the game tedious (specially because of constant respawn). This was asked
   by someone recently, and I found that interesting (and easy to implement too)
 - added trainer: as soon as an Oscar is picked up, the exit is open (find the clapperboard)
 - CD남 version pause reenabled (with play or 'P' key)
 
 Version 2.0 (10.11.2019) done by JOTD:
 - war level underwater wall could not be broken due to access fault
   fixes that were failing to do the correct thing in some
   special cases (see source code for details)
 - added trainer: infinite lives & energy
 - adapted to whdload v17  
 - source code included
 
 Version 1.9 (26.03.2002) Wepl, unreleased:
 - decruncher moved to fastmem

 Version 1.8 (24.02.2001) Wepl
 - supports CD남 Diggers-Bundle version:
 - gfx underwater bugs fixed
 
 Version 1.7 (16.01.2000), Wepl:
 - supports CD남 version
 - thanks to Dr.Zarkov for support

 Version 1.6 (08.12.1999) Wepl:
 - supports another version

Notes:

When second button is selected as jump, up remains active to go up underwater and control
the toy. For simplicity's sake, when the character is touching the water or in the water, both
button AND jump go up (this is for the mixed case when character is knee-deep in the water.
He goes up, then jumps when meets the surface. It would have been unpractical to forbid usage of second button to jump in
that case)

CD남 version never blocked "up" for jump but allowed reverse & forward joypad buttons to
perform the exact same operation. You can choose to leave controls as-is, or use blue button
for jump/swim.
