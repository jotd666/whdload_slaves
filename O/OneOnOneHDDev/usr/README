 This install applies to "One On One" © 1985 Electronic Arts.

 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate message.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.
    
 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, EXPCHIP, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.1 (22.02.2018) done by JOTD:
 - added calibrated delay loop to slow down game on faster amigas/WinUAE (issue #003554)
  (the calibration is empiric, but seems to work pretty well, report me any issues)
 - adapted to WHDLoad v17
 - reassembled with latest KickEmu: quitkey now works on 68000
 - now joystick port swap is the default
 
 version 1.0 (2002) done by JOTD:
 - Runs fully from HD using WHDLoad + KickEmu
 - Game now works on any amiga. No need for a A500/A1000 anymore.
 - Annoying blank screen delays removed
 - Disk protection removed (in a clean way)
 - CUSTOM1=1 allows to swap joystick & mouse ports (recommended)
 - Convenient install script
 - Quit key (default: F10, or configurable with QUITKEY)
 - Nice icon by Frank
