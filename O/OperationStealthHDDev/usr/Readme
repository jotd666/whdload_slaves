 This install applies to "Operation Stealth" © 1990 Delphine Software, 3 disks

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 

 The game requires a installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

History:

 Version 2.1 (20.11.2020) done by JOTD:
 - reassembled to new kickemu (quitkey works on 68000 too)
 - adapted to whdload 16
 - reworked slave, reduced to 512k chipmem (again)
 - reworked readme file
 
 Version 2.0 (15.07.2003) done by JOTD:
 - Rewritten for kick13, osemu no longer used. You've got to reinstall or copy
   the file "startup-sequence" of the install package in the directory "data"
   of the installed game, under a directory "s" (you'll have to create it too)
   otherwise the game will not boot and you'll have to type "delphine" to play!
 - Support for "James Bond 007 - The Stealth Affair", the US version of the game
   (Thanks Toaks for original images and support)
 - Source code included

 Version 1.3 (around 2002) done by JOTD:
 - I thought it was 100%, but there were an error/typo in expmem declaration. The
   game needed 8 megs of expansion mem! fixed (now needs 512K only!)

 Version 1.2 (around 2001) done by JOTD:
 - Convenient install script
 - Uses WHDLoad & OSEmu for full memory control & quit key
 - Runs with fastmem & caches for better loading and game speed
 - Supports theorically all versions. Tested with v4.0 (Kixx, UK), v3.6 (UK) and v3.7 (French)
 - V3.7 has lots of problems. Fixed
 - CPU dependent loops removed (music works OK with fast memory/caches on)
 - Color code protection removed (tough, did it 8 years ago!)
 - Saves to HD, without OS swaps with the help of zero-filled savegame files
 - Insert save disk requests removed
 - Quit key (numerical '*')
 - Icon by Frank
 - Docfile included
 - Walkthrough included

 Version 1.1 done by JOTD:
 - First WHDload release, supports only v4.0 and lots of problems still to solve

 Version 1.0 done by JOTD:
 - JST/OSEmu release, with hacked executable included


Notes:

- If you've got a save disk, you can copy its contents in the game directory
  (files named SD.DIR, and SD.<number>).
- Thanks to Olivier Schott and Juergen Bornmeyer for bug reports/their versions
  of the game (there are a lot of versions of this game out there)
- The install script asks you how is labelled your disk 1. It is because
  in the french version there's an accent on the e of "Operation"
- If you've got an old installed version and you've got trouble, please re-install
  game from floppies or run the install script in your game directory to update
  files (slave/OSEmu/Savegame files)
- The color code protection crack was done in a long week-end of may 1993
  using Action Replay and my A500. It took me (JOTD) more than 10 hours to figure out
  the difference between a wrong code and a correct code by blindly tracing the
  assembly code and backtracking it. If you ask me now (2020) how I did it, I must
  admit that I don't remember like AT ALL. But I remember that a value of $60 was
  present for a wrong code (at some point) and a value of $93 was present if the code
  was correct. And to my knowledge, no other proper crack exists. "cracked" versions
  made you press a key to display the color codes. Personally the game was provided to me
  with the color sheet copied in B/W and the code numbers written in the areas... Fun times!
