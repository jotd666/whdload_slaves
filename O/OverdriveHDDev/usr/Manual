           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Overdrive is a slick, arcade style fast-scrolling race game the likes
of which has never really been seen before on the Amiga. It combines super 
smooth action with an excellent feel to provide a game that we think is
unmatched in the playability stakes. Drive four different style vehicles
over 5 terrains and twenty tracks, against 8 different characters - each with
their own unique style.. ultimately finishing with the `race-off' of a 
lifetime against the menacing demon driver! 
With a difficulty curve that adapts to your own skills meaning that the game 
gets as hard as you wnat, when you want, Overdrive caters for drivers of all
ages and pedigree!

System Requirement: Overdrive will run on any 1meg Amiga. An extra disk 
drive is highly recommended to avoid disk-swaps during gameplay.


1. LOADING INSTRUTIONS 

	Turn your Amiga off at the power-supply and wait ten seconds before
turning it back on. This makes sure that your computers memory is clean.
Insert OVERDRIVE DISK ONE into your internal drive (df0:) and after a short
period, a presentation sequence will begin. After a while the program will 
have loaded and you will soon be ready for your first race.

	If you have any problems during loading, repeat the process above 
and in case of continued problems, consult the trouble-shooting guide.



2. OVERDRIVE MAIN MENU

	The main menu consists of 3 options;

	START	- Begin with the current game configuration.

	OPTIONS - Select the style of game and other aspects.

	DISK 	- Disk operations to save and load scores/lap-times.


3. OVERDRIVE OPTIONS MENU

	The options menu consists of the following 3 options;

	GAME MODE - Select from Arcade, Practice, Trails and 2 Player. These 
		    game modes will be detailed in the next section. Note that
		    for a 2 player gameyuo will require TWO machines linked 
		    with a null-modem cable, consult the section named 
		    `Overdrive 2 Player Game' for further information. 
	   	    The default selection is ARCADE.

	SOUND	  - Select from Music, Music and Sound Effects or Sound 
		    Effects Only.

	EXIT 	  - Quit back to the Main Menu.



			OVERDRIVE GAME MODES EXPLAINED
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	ARCADE
		This is the main single player arcade style challenge that the 
game is based around. It offers you a selection of race scenario`s to choose
from as you progress through the games ranks. In order to have the final 
`race-off' against the demon driver, you must achieve the games top-rank  -
and that means some pretty serious driving!  You are given an amount of cash
to start the game and it costs money to enter each race, but the harder the 
race, the better the prize! 
	Prior to the race you will have the chance to qualify and aim for a 
better grid positionin 3 timed laps - which also acts as an aid to learning 
the circuit, or you can jump straight into the race starting at the back of
the grid.
	You can improve your vehicles by picking up various parts during the
game... including wheels, spanners and fuel; these increase your car`s 
handling and performance in subsequent races. The game will keep a track of any
modified vehicles during play, as you can drive any of the four vehicles in any
given race. Other pick-ups are in the form of extra cash, turbo pads etc are 
also littered on the tracks.
	Yoy continue racing until your cash runs out or you are last in 3 
different races. Notice that in some races, you must WIN (ie be first) to 
continue and others, notably the easier tracks, you have to avoid finishing last
to continue.
	Races consist of a vehicle type, any one of five terrains and is against
2 of the 8 drivers, consult the character info section for details about them.
	From all of the above, a difficulty rating is obtained and this, 
in turn, affects both the entry cost and the prize money. The game will allow
a skilled driver to quickly skip through to more difficult races and rapidly
climb the ratings scale, whilst a novice can take more time on the lower levels
gradually building up confidence on easier races.
	When you finally enter the `Overdrive Race-Off' against the demon 
driver, it can be on any one of a number of specially configured `demon tracks'
So there are a number of different endings to the game. 
	You should find that the game offers you a slightly different menu of
race options each time you play, making for a longer-lasting game.
	Note that the best lap times are recorded for each race scenario and
are saved with the DISK option on the Main Menu.

	PRACTICE
			In this mode, you are able to custom design your car,
track and what opponents to race against. It is a non-scoring game but it 
does allow vital practice.

	TRIALS
		This is a form of practice that sees you up against the clock
only. You can select one of twenty configurated trials with the aim of beating
the best lap/race time. This option is for those wishing to practice their
driving skills and compete at the same time. The lap/race times in this mode
are kept and saved for future records, thye can also be reset if desired.
To save the updated lap/race times, use the DISK option on the main menu and 
select save.

	2 PLAYER
		This configures the game into 2 player link mode where you race
against human opposition on another Amiga! Follow the on-screen instructions
when linking machines and consult the main `Overdrive 2 Player Game' section
later in this text.
	In 2 player mode, you can select the race set-up from the options and
set the number of laps. The game will keep track of the scoring between
players. On screen, the other players car is shown in blue and no computer
cars will be on the track.


5. OVERDRIVE DISK MENU

	This menu is used for saving and reloading high-scores and the best
laps/race times in the TRIALS game-mode. All saving is automatic, simply 
follow the on-screen instructions.


6. OVERDRIVE SCREEN DISPLAY
	
	On screen you will notice the following;
	
	The main track display in the top 90% of the screen, with you car, the
	RED one in the middle.
	The track scanner in the bottom middle of the screen, which warns of up
	and coming road-patterns.
	The cross-haor is your current location. You may or may not wish to use
	the scanner depending on your control skill, but we recommend glancing
	down when you are on straights and not when driving around a bend!
		
	The bottom right will show you the following information;
	
	Current LAP time in mins, secs, 100th`s.sec.
	Record LAP time.

	The bottom left has indicators for Revs, Speed, Turbo, Fuel and also
the number of laps remaining. Fuel gradually runs out although you will have 
sufficient for most races - extra fuel can be picked up on some circuits. No
fuel means no speed, which in turn means GAME OVER!


7. OVERDRIVE CONTROL METHODS

	A lot of effort has gone intothe control method behind Overdrive, we
have tried to optimise the digital joystick input and real-car mechanics to 
produce a handling-feel that suits the game perfectly. It means that it`s 
not simply a case of flying around the track like a maniac, the game 
requires a lot of skill and crisp handling if you are to succeed.
	As a result, the control instructions on joystick are as follows;

	Fire Button   - Accelerate (Let go to decelerate)
	Joystick Back - Brake
	Joystick Left - Steer Left
	Joystick Right- Steer Right

	The important thing to notice during play is that when turning a
corner and accelerating (holding the fire button down), your car will slide
and skid in a wide arc, making it difficult to control. If you let go of the
button for a short period, this enables more overall car control and you will
find that you are able to turn more easily if a little slower. You will find
that it will take some practice to complete circuits at full speed - but in
order to achieve impressive lap-times you will have to put the work in!
	The handling may feel a little strange at first but you will find
that in a few minutes it becomes second nature and then it`s just a matter
of making sure you follow the best racing line for the current track.
	There ia also support for the LOGIC FREEWHEEL analogue steering
wheel, plug this into gameport 1, where the mouse usually is. The left 
buttin is the accelerator, the right is the brake.
	A Sega Megadrive Joypad (or compatible) is also supported, button B
is accelerate, C is brake. All Sega trademarks are acknowledged.


8. OVERDRIVE TRACK FEATURES

	On the tracks you will find oil, water spills, bumps, hills and all
manner of obstacles that cause havoc in your quest for a perfect lap.
	You`ll also be able to pick up bonus cash and other items which will
improve your chances in subsequent races. Look out for wheels, spanners and
fuel cans especially.


9. CAR INFORMATION

	There are four distinct types of vehicle in Overdrive;

	GP CAR
		This ground-hugging race machine loves the track and hates
the rest of the ground! You`ll find the speed amazing and the acceleration
incredible. GP cars are terrible on dirt and sand, skidding and spinning
uncontrollably, slowing to a stop. The GP cars are available on GP 
circuits, City circuits and the Icy circuits. The GP car is more at home on
a GP circuit.

	SUPERCAR
		This hybrid super sports car is not unlike the GP car in
performance but it does tend to slide on fast corners. It doesn`t mind the dirt
quite as much, but try and stick to the road! This car is quite versatile on
the GP, City and Icy circuits.

	4 X 4
		This powerful vehicle is able to bump `n bounce it`s way over
most terrains, having a slower top speed but more agile over rough ground.
It`s most at home on it`s own 4x4 arena although it handles well on the GP,
city and icy tracks.

	BUGGY
		This nippy little buggy will surprise everyone with it`s
turn of speed and versatility. At home on the desert tracks, you`ll also
find it in the 4x4 arena as well as the city circuits.


10. SCENARIO INFO

	In Overdrive, you`ll find yourself racing over five different
terrain types which are as follows; each one has an effect which depends
upon the car driven on it.

	GP CIRCUIT
		These are fast, smooth tracks where speed is optimum.
	GP circuits are best raced via the optimum `racing-line'. You`ll
	find few bumps and obstacles in your way, but expect a fast
	paced race from start to finish.

	CITY CIRCUIT
		Another fast, twisty track with good surfaces and few
	obstacles. The racing-line isn`t quite as important as with the
	GP circuits and therefore a little easier.

	ICY CIRCUIT
		The road is fast but very icy, making turning very
	hazardous. Speed freaks beware on these circuits. Watch out for
	rocks in the road!

	DESERT TRACK
		This bumpy, dusty road is ideal stomping ground for the
	buggies and 4x4`s. Expect all manner of obstacles in the way.

	4X4 ARENA
		A soft dust 4x4 indoor arena full of bumps and twist,
	ideal for the pacey buggies and 4x4 monsters. Don`t expect to
	find a GP or sportscar on here though!


11. CHARACTER INFO

	Eight different drivers to face in the arcade game, seven of which will
pit their wits against you and the last will only be revealed if you manage to
attain top rank and qualify for the Overdrive `Race-Off'.

	NAME		CHARACTERISTICS
	~~~~ 		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Burt	-	Very slow driver easy to beat
	Lana	-	Slow but accurate, relatively easy
	Dan	-	Composed, always has good lap-times
	Mad H	-	Completely unpredictable!
	Slick	-	The gentleman with high skills
	The Prof-	Very good though he relaxes if in front
	Sheik	-	Excellent driver putting in superb lap-times
	??????	-	Only the best will win this duel....


12. 2 PLAYER GAME

	The Overdrive 2 player game is played with two Amigas linked up via a
NULL MODEM CABLE. The cable is available from all good suppliers but if you
are unable to locate one, call our helpline number (Uk 0924 201846 during
normal office hours) and they will be happy to inform you of a source.
	The game will guide you through the link up stages and then go into
the game proper. Both players will appear as the RED car on their machine,
the other player appearing as blue, we recommend that the monitors are facing
opposite directions if at all possible.
	The game keeps a score of races won and offers the option to re-race
the previous track or select a new scenario. Exiting to the Main Menu will
disconnect the link-up and return the Amiga to normal mode.


13. TROUBLESHOOTING

	If you have trouble loading and the subsequent running of Overdrive,
carefully re-check the outlined procedure and your set-up. If you are sure
that everything is as it should be and you think something is wrong then
maybe d/l another version from your local bbs! You could alternatively buy
the original!@?
