Short : HD-Installer for Odyssey
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal & JOTD

This patch applies to "Odyssey" by Audiogenic (c) 1995 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD V17+.
Game requires 1MB ChipRAM and 0.5 other RAM (+ 1.6MB for PreLoad)

FEATURES:
- Game loads entirely from HD
- RNC disk protection removed
- Savegames redirected to HD
- Trainer option added (set CUSTOM1=1 for unlimited energy/lives)
- MS Windows incompatible filename renamed/patched
- BPLCON0 access fixed
- NI/ROM icon (created by JHZ)
- Quit option (your default key, don't use F10 as it's used in the game)

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.
