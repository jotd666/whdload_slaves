 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.
 
 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.0 (22.09.2020) done by JOTD:
 - ability to skip introduction
 - VBR/cache accesses removed
 - avoids os-flashes when saving a game
 - document protection removed
 - clean install which replaces custom (buggy) install
 - official support for 2 AGA versions and 2 ECS versions
   for english, and german languages (4 versions total)
 - nice icon by Exoticons
 - source code included

Note: the game saves 8 different files to disk in "data/save" directory!
So even if the slave pre-writes data, it's not possible to avoid 8 OS swaps
since whdload performs 1 swap per written file...
So there's a static option (selectable when installing the game) to avoid
os-flashes when saving a game. This option works by pre-copying empty (XPKSQSH-packed)
savegames during installation. The empty packed files are small but when unpacked they use 20kb each.
There are 20*8 = 160 of them totalling 3.5 megabytes (which is also roughly the amount of data used
when all save slots are taken by real savegames)
So if you have enough ram, this option is recommended. Else, don't install the files.

A good compromise is to delete savegames from x to 20: this frees RAM, and still allows to avoid
os-flashes for the x first savegames.
