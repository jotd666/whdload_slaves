Format a blank disk, and copy the contents of the Chaos directory on
this disk into the root directory of your disk.  

Now boot disk 2 of Chaos Strikes Back, and select `Make new adventure
or edit champion pictures` (the middle icon).  
Now load in the party of adventurers.  You will find
that they have a rideculous amount of hit points etc (20000+), so even
gods might have trouble beating them up!  You can now rename them, and
redesign their looks etc, to make them all your own!

End.
