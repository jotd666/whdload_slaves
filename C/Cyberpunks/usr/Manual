AIRLOCK DOORS ARE COLOUR - CODED,AND BLOCK OFF PASSAGES AND AREAS WITHIN THE
SUBDECKS.THEY CAN ONLY BE OPENED BY USE OF MATCHING COLOUR - CODED KEY CARDS
WHICH CAN BE FOUND SCATTERED AROUND THE VARIOUS DECKS ON EACH MISSION.
AIRLOCK DOORS CAN ALSO BE OPENED BY USING GREEN COMPUTER SOFTWARE DISKS IN

FOR THE CURRENT SUB-DECK AND OPEN THE DOORS - (SEE PICKUPS & POWERUP OBJECTS

WALKING ONTO THEM.A BLUE CIRCULAR PAD IS THE TELEPORT TRANSMITTER AND A RED
CIRCULAR PAD IS THE TELEPORT RECEIVER.YOU CANNOT TELEPORT BACK THE WAY YOU
CAME I.E. WALK BACK ONTO RED PAD,AND YOU MUST THEREFORE LOCATE OTHER BLUE
PADS TO TELEPORT BACK.BE WARNED THOUGH,YOUR SQUAD MAY END UP SOMEWHERE ELSE
COMPLETELY-ALTHOUGH THERE IS NORMALLY ALWAYS A WAY BACK IF YOU FIND THAT YOU
CANNOT FIND A CERTAIN OBJECT YOU NEED,SUCH AS A KEY PASS CARD TO OPEN A DOOR.

COMPUTER TERMINALS:

YOUR SQUAD CAN LOG-ON TO COMPUTER THAT CAN BE FOUND ON MOST SUB-DECKS AT ANY
TIME,BY SIMPLE WALKING INTO A TERMINAL SCREEN.YOU WILL THEN BE PRESENTED WITH
A LOG-ON SEQUENCE WHICH WILL CONNECT THE REMOTE TERMINAL TO THE UNIVERSAL
MATRIX 1000 CPU NETWORK.IF THE LOG-ON SEQUENCE IS SUCCESSFUL THE TERMINAL
WILL GO ONLINE,HOWEVER SOME TERMINALS ARE DAMAGED AND WILL SHOW THE MESSAGE
FAILED IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO CONNECT,AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO USE SUCH
TERMINALS.ALSO TERMINALS WITH BROKEN SCREENS ARE TOTALLY UNUSABLE,SO FINDING
ONE THAT WORKS ISN"T AS EASY IT SOUNDS.

ASSUMING THE SQUAD FIND A TERMINAL WHICH IS FULLY OPERATIONAL,THEN A MENU
WILL BE DISPLAYED SHOWING THE NUMBER OF EACH TYPE OF COMPUTER SYSTEM SOFTWARE
DISKS YOUR SQUAD IS CARRYING.YOU CAN THEN SELECT THE SOFTWARE DISK TO RUN ON
THE TERMINAL,BY MOVING THE SELECTION ICON UP AND DOWN WITH THE JOYSTICK AND
THEN PRESSING FIRE TO MAKE YOUR SELECTION,OR EXIT THE TERMINAL IF REQUIRED.

EACH DISK TYPE WILL TAKE YOU TO A DIFFERENT MENU WHICH EXPLAINS IN GREATER
DETAIL THE OPERATIONAL FUNCTION OF EACH DISK,HOWEVER YOU MUST ACTUALLY HAVE
THE PARTICULAR DISK IN YOUR POSSESSION TO SEE THE REQUIRED MENU.AFTER A DISK
IS SELECTED AND THE SOFTWARE HAS PERFORMED IT"S FUNCTION,THE DISK WILL BE
ERASED AND REMOVED FROM YOUR TOTAL ON THE MAIN MENU,FROM WHICH YOU MAY MAKE
ANOTHER SELECTION UNTIL ALL DISKS ARE EXHAUSTED.(SEE PICKUPS & POWERUP
OBJECTS - COMPUTER SOFTWARE DISKS SECTION FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE FUNCTION OF
EACH DISK.)

DECK LIFTS:

LOCATE ONE OF THESE TO MOVE TO A NEW SUB-DECK.THEY ARE CLEARLY MARKED AS
