{Adam Smith (1723-1790)}
British economist who published the first major work of political 
economy, "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of 
Nations," which was a detailed examination of the consequences of 
economic freedom.

{Adam Smith allows factory level buildings to be built in the colonies.
Factories allow the production of 1 and 1/2 units of manufactured goods 
for each unit of raw materials.}



{Jakob Fugger (1459-1525)}
Extremely successful German merchant active in early import and export 
business from the East Indies. Exceedingly rich, he loaned money to 
Emperor Maxmillian I of Germany. 

{When Fugger joins the Congress, all boycotts currently in effect are 
forgiven, without back taxes. Trade in these goods may be resumed at no 
cost.}



{Peter Minuit (1580-1639)}
Director-general of the Dutch West India Company's colony in America, 
he bought the Island of Manhattan from the Indians for $24....!

{Once Peter Minuit joins the Continental Congress, the Indians no longer 
demand payment for their land.}



{Peter Stuyvesant (1610-1672)}
First successful governor of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (New 
York), he ruled harshly and promoted increased trade and increased 
protection of New World interests.

{Peter Stuyvesant allows construction of the Custom House 
in your colonies which can streamline trade with Europe and allows 
European trade during the Revolution.}



{Jan de Witt (1625-1672)}
Dutch statesmen and Chief Minister of the United Provinces of the 
Netherlands, he sought to abolish the office of the stadtholder and to limit 
the power of the House of Orange. 

{When de Witt joins your Congress, trade with foreign colonies
is allowed. In addition, your Foreign Affairs report becomes more 
revealing.}



{Ferdinand Magellan (1480-1521)}
Portuguese explorer who led the first European expedition to 
successfully circumnavigate the globe. Although Magellan himself did not 
complete the voyage, his leadership and daring made it possible. 

{With Magellan in the Congress, the movement allowance of all naval 
vessels is increased by one, and the time to sail from the west 
map edge to Europe is shortened considerably.}



{Francisco de Coronado (1510-1554)}
Spanish conquistador who led the first European expedition into the 
American southwest. He was the first to observe the Grand Canyon and the 
Pueblos of New Mexico. Coronado was a careful organizer and a great scout 
who gleaned valuable information about a wide area.

{When he joins the Congress, all existing colonies and the area around 
them become visible on the map.}



{Hernando de Soto (1500-1542)}
Ruthless Spanish Conquistador who led the first European expedition into 
the southeastern areas of North America. He landed in Florida and 
explored much of Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, 
and Arkansas.

{With De Soto, results of exploring Lost City Rumors are always 
positive, and all units have an extended sighting radius.}



{Henry Hudson (????-1611)}
English explorer, in the service of the Netherlands, who explored 
Chesapeake and Delaware bays and the Hudson River as far north as 
present-day Albany. Hudson later discovered Hudson bay and was finally 
killed by mutineers. Hudson bay became a primary fur trapping 
preserve, and the Hudson Bay Company operated extensive trapping and 
processing facilities for many years.

{Hudson increases the output of all Fur trappers by 100%%.}



{La Salle (1643-1687)}
French Explorer who sailed down the Mississippi River into the Gulf of 
Mexico and claimed  for the French Crown all land drained by this mighty 
river. He was instrumental in establishing French dominance west of the 
Appalachians.

{La Salle gives all existing and future colonies a stockade when the 
population of the colony reaches 3.}



{Hernan Cortes (1485-1547)}
Spanish conqueror of Mexico and destroyer of the Aztec empire, Cortes is 
the paradigm conquistador, a master of conquest and plunder.

{When Cortes joins your Congress, conquered native settlements always 
yield treasure, in greater abundance, and the king's galleons transport the 
treasure free of charge.}




{George Washington (1732-1799)}
Commander of American revolutionary forces and first President of the 
United States, George Washington displayed a remarkable ability to train 
and inspire colonial forces to victory.

{Once Washington joins the Continental Congress, every non-veteran
soldier or dragoon who wins a combat is automatically upgraded.}



{Paul Revere (1735-1818)}
American patriot who served in the Continental Army during the War of 
Independence and roused the minutemen as British forces approached. 
Paul Revere's example as a patriot allows colonists working at productive 
duties to become minutemen, capable of rallying to the defense of the  
colony in times of danger.

{When a colony with no standing soldiers is attacked, a colonist
automatically takes up any stockpiled muskets in defense of the colony.}




{Francis Drake (1540-1596)}
England's greatest seaman of the Elizabethan period, Drake was a 
formidable privateer who terrorized the Spanish Main with a fleet of 
fifteen ships then rescued a floundering English colony.

{When Drake joins the Congress, the combat strengths of all your 
privateers are increased by 50%%.}



{John Paul Jones (1747-1792)}
Daring Scottish naval commander who served for the colonies during the 
War of Independence, he demonstrated his incredible abilities in many 
daring exploits in battle.

{When Jones enters the Congress, a Frigate is added to your colonial
navy, without cost.}



{Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826)}
Great US statesman, framer of the Constitution, and third President of the 
United States, Jefferson promoted the development of democratic 
institutions within Colonial America. 

{Jefferson's presence in the Congress increases Liberty Bell production 
of statesmen by 50%%.}



{Pocahontas (1595-1617)}
Powhattan Indian princess who mediated tensions between the English 
colony at Jamestown and the Powhattan Confederacy of Virginia. 
Pocahontas married John Rolffe, an Englishman from Jamestown, which 
led to a period of peace between the Indians and the English.

{When Pocahontas joins the Congress, all tension levels between you and 
the natives are reduced to content, and all Indian alarm is generated half 
as fast.}



{Thomas Paine (1737-1809)}
Englishman that migrated to Philadelphia and wrote the important, 
inflammatory pamphlet, "Common Sense," which strongly advocated total 
independence for the colonies. He later wrote "The Rights of Man" in 
favor of the French Revolution, and finally "The Age of Reason."

{When Paine enters the Continental Congress, Liberty Bell production
in all colonies is increased by value of the current tax rate.}



{Simon Bolivar (1783-1830)}
Organized and, in large part, conducted the rebellions in a vast area of 
northern South America, liberating current-day Venezuela, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.

{When Bolivar is in the Congress, Sons of Liberty membership in all 
your colonies is increased by 20%%.}



{Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790)}
Colonial and later US Statesman who became the first Postmaster, 
printer, and foreign ambassador in the English colonies. He was also one 
of the first great American scientists. Franklin, as ambassador to Europe 
in the Continental Congress, brings coherence to the colonies' relations 
with foreign powers.

{The King's European Wars have no further effect on the relations 
between the powers in the New World, and Europeans in the New World 
always offer peace in negotiations.}



{William Brewster (1567-1644)}
One of the Pilgrim Fathers and framers of the Mayflower Compact, 
William Brewster served as the first Pilgrim minister, and was 
instrumental in organizing the party that sailed on the Mayflower.

{With Brewster in the Congress, no more criminals or servants appear 
on the docks, and  you select which immigrant in the Recruitment Pool 
will move to the docks.}



{William Penn (1644-1718)}
English Quaker leader and founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn 
obtained a large land grant in North America for religious freedom. This 
land later became Pennsylvania. 

{With Penn, cross production in all colonies is increased by 50%%.}



{Father Jean de Brebeuf (1593-1649)}
French Jesuit Missionary who died at the hands of the Iroquois in the 
Huron country of Canada in a battle between the Hurons and Iroquois. He 
translated the Catechism into the Huron language and was canonized in 
1930.

{With de Brebeuf in the Congress, all missionaries function as experts.}



{Juan de Sepulveda (ca. 1490-ca. 1573)}
Spanish philosopher and "humanist" who argued for harsh treatment of 
the natives. He based his reasoning on the proposition that the Natives 
were incapable of ruling themselves because of their savagery; this was 
proved by their inability to resist Spanish invasion...

{His presence in the Congress increases the chance that subjugated 
Indians will "convert" and join a colony.}



{Bartolome de Las Casas (1474-1566)}
The "Apostle of the Indians," Las Casas was a Spanish missionary who 
sailed with Columbus' third expedition. His efforts to protect the native 
population from slavery and abuse led him to speak on their behalf in the 
Spanish courts on several occasions.

{With Las Casas, all currently existing Indian converts are assimilated
into the colonies as free colonists.}

{FOOD}
Food is one of the most valuable commodities your people
produce. The survival of your colonies depends upon it. The best
places to grow food are in {plains, grasslands, prairie, and savannah.}
Plowing the land also increases food yield. {Fishing} is an excellent
source of food, and {fisheries} are particularly productive.

{Each colonist working inside a colony eats 2 food every turn.}



{SUGAR}
Sugar is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit or
converted into {Rum} by a {distiller} for sale at a better price. 

{Sugar grows most abundantly in Savannah, especially in Prime Sugar 
Land.}


{TOBACCO}
Tobacco is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit 
or converted into {Cigars} by a {tobacconist} for sale at a better price. 

{Tobacco grows most abundantly in Grassland, especially in Prime 
Tobacco Land.}



{COTTON}
Cotton is a cash crop that can be sold in Europe for a handsome profit or
converted into {Cloth} by a {weaver} for sale at a better price. 

{Cotton grows most abundantly in Prairie, especially in Prime Cotton 
Land.}


{FURS}
Fur is abundant in the Americas and there is a hungry market for it 
in Europe. Your {fur traders} can convert furs into coats for an even 
greater profit. {Woodlands} of all sorts are good for trapping, but 
even better are {game and beaver} squares in colder climates. 
Additionally, a {road} in a forest square increases fur output.

{Fur is found most abundantly in all forested areas, but especially in 
colder terrains where there is Beaver.}



{LUMBER}
Lumber is one of the most valuable commodities you can produce. Your
{carpenters} need lumber to build {buildings, ships, artillery, and
fortifications.} Lumber is collected whenever your pioneers clear a
forested square or when you have lumberjacks working the forests.

{Woodland of all sorts is good for wood cutting, and roads in forests 
and Prime Timber increase lumber production.}



{ORE}
Ore is one of your most useful resources. It can be sold in Europe or 
converted into {tools} by your {blacksmiths.} Tools may then be changed 
into {guns,} by {gunsmiths.}

{Ore is found in hills, mountains, and swamps.} 



{SILVER}
Silver is one of the most valuable metals found in the New 
World. Silver can be mined from {mountain} squares, and some native 
civilizations have it in great quantity.

{Silver is found in mountains, but these abundant sources will soon run 
dry if mined.}


{HORSES}
Horses are useful for aiding travel in the New World. {Scouts and 
Dragoons} move significantly faster than do colonists on foot.  {Any 
colonist} may be mounted to create {scouts} and {any soldier} can be 
mounted to create {dragoons.}

{Horses can be obtained only in Europe,} but once brought over, they 
may be bred. If you have {two or more horses} in a colony and {extra food} 
stored in your warehouse, your colony will {produce more horses}. If you
construct stables, your horses will breed twice as fast.

{RUM}
Rum is the product of sugar processing in a distillery. It is usually of 
much greater monetary value than raw sugar.

{Any colonist working as a distiller can convert sugar into rum.}



{CIGARS}
Cigars are the product of tobacco processing in a tobacconist's house or 
shop. Cigars are usually of much greater monetary value than raw 
tobacco.

{Any colonist working as a tobacconist can convert tobacco into cigars.}



{CLOTH}
Cloth is the product of cotton processing in a weaver's house or shop. It 
is usually of much greater monetary value than raw cotton.

{Any colonist working as a weaver can convert cotton into cloth.}


{COATS}
Coats are made from fur in a fur trader's house or shop. They are 
usually of much greater monetary value than unprocessed pelts.

{Any colonist working as a fur trader can convert fur into coats.}



{TRADE GOODS}
Trade Goods can be obtained only in Europe or from other European 
settlements. These represent manufactured goods such as small tools, 
jewelry, and clothing, which the Indians may want to trade for. Most 
native tribes will gladly take trade goods, at least at first.


{TOOLS}
Tools are fundamental to successful colonial endeavors. You need tools to 
create {pioneers,} and only pioneers can {build roads, clear forests, and 
plow fields.} Additionally, tools are necessary to complete many 
{buildings} you construct inside your colonies. Finally, tools are 
converted into muskets by {gunsmiths.}

{Tools may be bought in Europe or manufactured by blacksmiths, who 
convert ore into tools.}



{MUSKETS}
Muskets are necessary for defense of your colonies and for building a 
substantial military force. You need muskets to create soldier
units. {Any colonist} may be given muskets to create {soldiers} and {any 
scout} may be given muskets to create {dragoons.} 

{Muskets may be purchased in Europe or manufactured at an armory, 
magazine, or arsenal.} Any colonist working as a gunsmith can convert 
tools into muskets.

                    Artillery            






{COLONISTS}
These represent the various people that come to the New World. A single 
colonist in the game represents a number of people in real life, perhaps 
100-200. There are four general types of colonists, each with different 
capabilities: petty criminals, indentured servants, free colonists, and 
specialists. Any of these colonists can do any job available in the 
settlement, but the experts do their particular jobs very well.

Another type exists: Indian Converts. These represent Native Americans 
that join your settlements and become colonists. They're very effective at 
outdoors jobs, but are little suited for manufacturing.


{SOLDIERS}
Soldiers are created when you give a colonist {muskets.} A 
soldier may become a {veteran} as a result of winning battles or of 
education in a {college}. Additionally, {Expert soldiers (veterans)} may 
immigrate to the New World from Europe upon occasion, and may be hired 
from the {Royal University.} 


{PIONEERS}
Pioneer units are created when you give a colonist {tools.} 
Pioneers have several important functions: they {clear woods, plow 
fields, and build roads.} In general, {Hardy Pioneers} perform their tasks 
faster than ordinary colonists working as pioneers.


{MISSIONARIES}
A missionary may be created at any site where there is a {church or 
cathedral.} This may be on the {Docks of Europe} or in a colony where a 
church or cathedral has been built. Missionaries perform the following 
important special functions: {create missions in native settlements} to 
counteract Indian anger; {denounce another European's mission} in a 
native settlement (which can result in the destruction of that mission), 
or {incite Indians to attack} another European power. {Jesuit 
Missionaries are particularly effective at these tasks.}



{DRAGOONS}
Dragoons are {soldiers mounted on horseback,} the colonial equivalent of 
cavalry. Any soldier may be converted into a dragoon if he is given horses. 
Dragoons can move farther during a turn, and they fight more effectively. 
{Veteran dragoons are more effective in battle than normal mounted 
soldiers.}



{SCOUTS}
Any colonist can become a scout if he is mounted on {horses.} Scouts 
can perform many valuable services to your cause: they {reveal} 
unexplored terrain faster, {move farther} in a turn, have better luck 
when {exploring Lost City Rumors,} can meet with and {talk to Indian 
chiefs,} {infiltrate enemy colonies} to see what's going on, and meet with 
enemy mayors in their colonies. {Seasoned scouts are better at all these 
tasks than regular colonists working as scouts.}



{REGULARS}
European regular infantry units are the Crown's regular army troops. 
They enter the game against you if you declare independence. Their only
weakness is lack of training in the rough, wilderness terrain of the New 
World.


{CONTINENTAL CAVALRY}
Continental Cavalry is one step above your veteran dragoons in combat
effectiveness. They know the backwoods, are veteran soldiers, and have 
received some military training.



{CAVALRY}
European regular cavalry units are the Crown's regular mounted soldiers. 
They enter the game against you if you declare independence. Their 
weakness is lack of training in the rough, wilderness terrain of the New 
World.


{CONTINENTAL ARMY}
Continental Army infantry is one step above your veteran soldiers in 
combat effectiveness. They know the backwoods, are veterans, and have 
received some regular  military training.


{TREASURE TRAIN}
This wagon train carries {plunder,} usually gold and silver, precious 
stones, and rare fabrics. Treasure trains are used to cart away the 
plunder gleaned from a native settlement or lost city. A {Galleon} is 
always required to transport the contents of a treasure train by sea.


{ARTILLERY}
Artillery may be bought in {Europe} or constructed by the armories 
within your colonies. Artillery is very effective at {attacking and 
defending colonies,} and also at attacking fortified units and Indian 
settlements. However, when defending in unprotected terrain it is 
extremely vulnerable, and when attacking there it is ineffective. An 
artillery unit that is defeated in battle is damaged and loses some of its 
firepower; if defeated again, it is destroyed.



{WAGON TRAIN}
Wagon Trains are used for hauling goods and commodities {over land.} In 
order to trade most profitably with the Indians you should enter their 
settlements with wagons full of goods. A wagon train can transport any 
cargo a ship can, except colonists and artillery. Wagons have 2 cargo 
holds and can be assigned to {trade routes.} You may never build more 
wagon trains than you have colonies.


{CARAVEL}
A Caravel is an exploration ship designed to carry a small crew 
and adequate cargo for a few months of provisions. 



{MERCHANTMAN}
A Merchantman is a medium-sized cargo ship. Its main function is to 
carry cash commodities to port for trade. It is a little larger than a 
caravel with more sail. 



{GALLEON}
A Galleon is a large cargo vessel designed for long voyages and heavy 
transport. It is as large as a ship of the line, but not armed. 



{PRIVATEER}
A Privateer is a ship owned by an individual that has obtained a "Letter of 
Marque" from his government, giving him the "right" to prey upon 
foreign shipping. Privateers can be very dangerous to your commerce 
because they observe no code of international behavior; the countries 
sponsoring them will likely claim no knowledge of their actions. 



{FRIGATE}
Frigates are dangerous gunships, capable of sinking or damaging 
enemy vessels.  



{MAN-O-WAR}
These powerful vessels appear in American waters when the War of 
Independence develops. Your mother country will send them against your 
forces, and, if foreign intervention occurs, you'll receive some to support 
your cause. They are heavily armed with cannon and capable of carrying 
large invasion forces or cargoes.



{BRAVES}
Braves are small groups of Native Americans. They represent Indians in 
their natural state, before receiving guns and horses from Europeans.



{ARMED BRAVES}
Native Americans become increasingly dangerous as they learn to use the 
deadly weapons of the Europeans. When a native tribe obtains guns from 
the Europeans, some braves will be armed with them. {This, combined 
with their knowledge of the wilderness, make them formidable opponents 
in the woods, hills, and mountains.}



{MOUNTED BRAVES}
Native American peoples did not have access to horses until the Spanish 
brought them in the late 15th century. In some cases, Indian culture 
changed considerably to incorporate the horse as a vital element. {Horses 
increase the mobility and combat power of the Indians.}



{MOUNTED WARRIORS}
Tribes that have horses and muskets are very dangerous. They are as good 
as any colonial dragoons -- even better when fighting in the wilderness.

Cold and icy, the arctic is almost incapable of supporting life.



{OCEAN}
This is the wide open water of the sea. It is useful for fishing, 
especially along the coasts, and in fisheries.

{EXPERT FARMERS} 
Some of your people have a knack for growing food crops and an 
understanding of weather and seasons. These experts can be found in 
Europe as immigrants or trained at the Royal University. Some Native 
Americans are excellent farmers,  as well, and can teach free colonists 
and indentured servants the secrets of  agriculture. The best place for 
farming is in the plains. 

{Expert farmers grow 2 more food in a square than other farmers.}




{MASTER SUGAR PLANTERS}
Planting and tending of sugar cane is a complicated job that takes 
planning and special techniques. Only the Native Americans are 
knowledgeable enough to be called experts, and only they can teach your 
people to do it. However, a colonist that works at it long enough may 
become a master himself.

{The best place for sugar cultivation is in the savannah.}

{Master sugar planters are twice as productive as others.}


{MASTER TOBACCO PLANTERS}
Tobacco is found in great abundance in the New World. It is cultivated and 
used by the Native Americans for many ritual as well as leisure purposes. 
Some Indians have great knowledge of this mysterious weed and will help 
your people become masters at cultivating it.

{The best place for tobacco cultivation is in the grasslands.}

{Master tobacco planters are twice as productive at growing tobacco than 
others.}



{MASTER COTTON PLANTERS}
The cotton found in the New World is of high quality, capable of being 
spun into fine fabrics and garments. Master planters of cotton must be 
trained by the Native Americans who have learned through years of 
experience the best ways to cultivate this staple crop.

{The best place for cotton cultivation is in the prairie.}

{Master cotton planters are twice as productive at growing cotton than 
all others.}


{MASTER FUR TRAPPERS}
The New World is abundantly supplied with fur-bearing mammals whose 
pelts can be sold for a handsome profit in Europe. Native Americans have 
long studied and trapped these creatures for their fur and meat. Your 
people can learn the ways of the forest creatures and become master 
trappers only from the Indians.

{The best place to find fur is in wooded country, especially in colder 
climates.}

{A master trapper is twice as productive as other trappers.}



{EXPERT LUMBERJACKS}
Lumber has long been a necessity in both New and Old Worlds. Expert 
lumber men can be found on the docks of Europe or trained there.

{The best places for lumber cutting are forests and woodlands.}

{Expert lumberjacks are able to yield twice as much lumber as others.}



{EXPERT ORE MINERS}
Since the Iron Age, mining has been an important occupation in the Old 
World. There are many experts there who understand minerals and 
deposits, veins and mine construction. You can get expert miners from the 
European Docks or from training them.

{The best places to find ore are mountains, hills, and swamps, especially 
where 
there are mineral deposits.}

{Expert ore miners are twice as productive as others.}



{EXPERT SILVER MINERS}
Like ore mining, silver mining is an important and lucrative skill that is 
widely understood in Europe.

{The best place to find silver is in the mountains, especially where there 
are deposits.}

{Expert silver miners are twice as productive as others.}



{EXPERT FISHERMEN}
Fishing has long been a lucrative business in Europe, and many of your 
immigrants come with expertise in this area -- an understanding of the 
habits and habitats of fish. The best places to fish are along the coasts of 
the oceans and in the lakes.
	
{In general the more land that borders the square in which a fisherman 
works, 
the more productive he is.}

{Expert fisherman are twice as productive as others.} 



{EXPERT DISTILLERS}
The craft of transforming raw {sugar into rum} and other spirits is as old 
as civilization itself. Some of the immigrants that come to your shores 
will have knowledge of these techniques.

{An expert distiller is twice as productive as an ordinary colonist 
working as a distiller.}



{MASTER TOBACCONISTS}
After observing the Indians smoking tobacco and learning the many 
nuances of pipe and cigar construction, a small industry has risen in 
Europe to take advantage of this new market. Tobacconists convert 
{tobacco into cigars.} Master tobacconists appear on the Docks in Europe 
or can be trained there.

{A master tobacconist is twice as productive as an ordinary colonist 
working as a tobacconist.}



{MASTER WEAVERS}
Weaving is an age-old craft that dates back as far as human memory. 
Weavers convert cotton into cloth and appear in Europe as immigrants, or 
can be trained there.

{Master weavers are twice as productive as others at weaving cotton into 
cloth.}



{MASTER FUR TRADERS}
The abundance of fur in the New World has vitalized the fur industry in 
Europe, and many expert furriers are coming to the New World to make 
their fortunes. Fur traders convert furs into coats and you get expert fur 
traders from the docks, or you can train them.

{Master fur traders are twice as productive as other colonists working 
as traders converting fur into coats.}



{EXPERT CARPENTERS}
The timberland of the New world provides the raw materials for a host of 
construction projects. A master carpenter is essential to the development 
of your colonial society. Master carpenters appear on the docks in Europe 
or can be trained there.

{They are twice as productive as an ordinary colonistS working as 
carpenters, 
converting lumber into buildings.}



{EXPERT BLACKSMITHS}
Metal working is an essential ingredient to successful colonization. 
Blacksmiths can repair metal implements and create new ones. 
Blacksmiths transform {ore into tools.} Expert blacksmiths appear on the 
docks in Europe or can be trained there.

{Expert blacksmiths are twice as productive as ordinary colonists 
working as blacksmiths.}




{MASTER GUNSMITHS}
The ability to arm your people with weapons is fundamental in your 
journey towards independence. Gunsmiths transform {tools into muskets.} 
Expert gunsmiths appear on the docks in Europe or can be trained there.

{They are twice as productive as an ordinary colonist working as a 
gunsmith.}




{FIREBRAND PREACHERS}
Religious unrest in Europe is a catalyst for immigration to the New 
World and is increased by preachers in the new world. Preachers produce 
crosses, representing religious freedom in the New World. The more 
crosses produced in America, the faster immigrants flock to the docks in 
Europe.

{A firebrand preacher produces twice the number of crosses as another 
colonists preaching in a church or cathedral.}



{ELDER STATESMEN}
Politicians are valuable members of your society, for they 
build your political infrastructure. Statesmen produce Liberty Bells, 
representing governmental sophistication and patriotic fervor. Elder 
statesmen can be trained in Europe or found on the docks there.

{Elder statesmen produce twice the number of Liberty Bells as ordinary 
colonists working as statesmen in the Town Hall.}




{Student}

(There's all that was in the original file. Not authors mistake.)



{FREE COLONISTS}
Free Colonists are immigrants desiring to go to the New World as free 
men and women and willing to work for the good of their communities. 
Free colonists are productive in all spheres of work -- in the fields and 
in the cottages. Short of being specially trained in a trade, they are the 
most productive members of your society.



{HARDY PIONEERS}
A special breed of men and women come to the new world and carve a 
civilization out of the wilderness. Your pioneers are the advance guard of 
your new society. They build the roads, clear the land, and plow the fields. 
A pioneer can be created by giving any colonist tools, but hardy pioneers 
can be found on the docks of Europe, or trained.

{Hardy pioneers perform all pioneer functions faster than ordinary 
colonists working as pioneers.}



{VETERAN SOLDIERS}
Any colonist can become a soldier if given muskets, but only experience in 
combat or training can create veterans. Veterans of European wars 
occasionally immigrate and appear on the docks, or you can train them in 
the Royal University. Additionally soldiers that win battles eventually 
become veterans.



{SEASONED SCOUTS}
Any colonists mounted on horses may act as scouts. They see farther, move 
faster, and have the ability to gather information about foreign 
settlements, including Indian towns and villages. Seasoned scouts do all the 
above more effectively and safely. Seasoned scouts sometimes appear as 
immigrants on the Docks in Europe. Other times, scouts become seasoned 
after visiting Indian settlements.




{VETERAN DRAGOONS}
Until the rise of your Continental Army, your veteran dragoons are the 
best military units you have. Dragoons are like soldiers in all respects 
except they are mounted on horseback and are thus slightly more 
powerful. They attain veteran status, like soldiers, through training or 
experience.



{JESUIT MISSIONARIES}
The Jesuits are zealous christians who will gladly enter the lands and 
villages of the natives, establish missions, and live among them to teach 
the ways of Christianity. They serve as ambassadors to the natives and can 
often convince them to go to war for your cause against rival Europeans. 
Their main function is to asuage the anger of the native tribes and create 
converts.

{Jesuit missionaries are much more effective at all missionary tasks than 
ordinary colonists that have been blessed as missionaries.}



{INDENTURED SERVANTS}
Indentured Servants are people desiring to come to the New World but 
who cannot afford to pay their own way. They, accordingly, put 
themselves into bondage and agree to work off their passage in the New 
World. They, like petty criminals, are useful workers in the fields and 
mines, but are less productive than free colonists in manufacturing and 
processing jobs. But, through education or military experience, they can 
become free colonists.



{PETTY CRIMINALS}
Petty Criminals have been ordered to the New World as punishment for 
their crimes. In general, criminals are the {least productive members of 
your communities.} They make good laborers but are almost totally 
ineffective in manufacturing or processing jobs. But, through education 
or military experience, they can become servants.



{INDIAN CONVERTS}
Missionaries working among the native population are able to convince 
some of the Indians of the veracity of Christianity. These converts are 
good outdoorsmen -- good at all the outdoor professions. However, they 
are not well suited to manufacturing or processing jobs.

{stockade}
A stockade is a low wooden barricade made of poles, sharpened at the top, 
with loop holes for firing muskets, and crude inside shelves for gunners. 

The construction of a stockade around a settlement represents a 
significant effort from the community and is a symbol of a willingness to 
stay for a while. Construction of a stockade may be started when the 
colony is still quite small (population 3). Once the stockade is completed, 
the population of the colony may not voluntarily be reduced to less than 3.

{A unit defending a colony inside a stockade has its defense strength 
increased by 100%.}



{fort}
A fort is a substantial improvement over the stockade and can be 
built when the {population reaches 4} and already has a stockade in place. 
The stockade is reinforced with metal braces, artillery is installed to 
cover exposed approaches, and substantial defensive planning is evident. A 
fort overlooking the ocean will slow the progress of foreign vessels and 
open fire on them if they venture too close.

{The defense strength of a unit defending a colony in a fort is increased 
by 150%%.}



{fortress}
A fortress is an upgraded fort that can be built when the {population of the 
colony reaches 8} and already has a fort in place. The stout wooden 
barricade is reinforced and, in critical spots, replaced by stone masonry. 
Embrasures now house the artillery, which is more extensively used. 
Well-planned, overlapping fields of fire characterize the exterior 
approaches. A fortress overlooking the ocean will slow the progress of 
foreign vessels and open fire on them if they venture too close.

{Units receive a 200%% defense bonus inside fortresses.}



{armory}
Your people can construct an armory, a metal-working facility which 
allows the steady construction of muskets out of tools.

{The armory allows your carpenters to make artillery units, and your 
gunsmiths to convert tools into muskets.}



{magazine}
An armory can be upgraded into a magazine when the colony's population 
reaches 8.

{A magazine doubles the output of muskets if the required tools are 
available.}



{arsenal}
A magazine can be upgraded into an arsenal when the colony's population 
is 8.

{An arsenal doubles the output of muskets, if the required tools are 
available.}



{docks}
Docks are the moorings and wharves necessary to process fish garnered 
from the various fishing beds and fisheries scattered along the coasts of 
the New World.

{Docks allow your colonists to work as fishermen in any ocean or lake 
square adjacent to the colony.}



{drydocks}
Drydocks include facilities and equipment for repairing ships and boats 
that have been damaged in naval combat. There is a drydock in your 
mother country at all times, but your people can construct a drydock in 
any coastal colony which already contains docks and has a population of 6. 
Whenever a naval unit is damaged, it is placed automatically in the 
nearest drydock for repairs.

{The presence of drydocks in a colony enables that colony to repair
damaged ships, instead of having them returned to Europe.}



{shipyard}
Shipyards are facilities that contain all equipment necessary to build 
ships.

{The presence of a shipyard in a colony enables carpenters to construct 
ships.}


{TOWN HALL}
A town hall is one of the first structures the founders put together. It 
provides a place where the colonists from the surrounding area can gather 
to discuss issues facing the community. This is the first inkling of 
colonial government. A colonist in the meeting house produces Liberty 
Bells, which represent growing nationalism and colonial government. An 
elder statesman in a meeting house produces many Liberty Bells.



{TOWN HALL} 

 (There's that was in the original file. Not authors mistake.)



{COLONIAL ASSEMBLY}


{schoolhouse}
To begin educating your citizenry, you must build a schoolhouse. It can be 
built when your population is 4. {The schoolhouse allows the following 
specialists to teach their skills to other colonists:}
Expert Farmer
Expert Fisherman
Expert Silver Miner
Expert Ore Miner
Expert Lumberjack
Master Fur Trapper
Master Carpenter
Hardy Pioneer
Seasoned Scout



{college}
A Schoolhouse can be upgraded to a college when the population reaches 8. 
It functions identically to the schoolhouse, except: {Two specialists may 
teach simultaneously, and the following additional skills may be taught.}
Master Sugar Planter
Master Cotton Planter
Master Tobacco Planter
Master Distiller
Master Weaver
Master Tobacconist
Master Fur Trader
Master Blacksmith
Master Gunsmith
Veteran Soldier



{university}
A college may be upgraded to a university when the {population reaches 
10.} It functions like a college, except:

{Three specialists may teach simultaneously, and the following additional 
skills may be taught:}
Jesuit Missionary
Firebrand Preacher
Elder Statesman



{warehouse}
Normally, the storage facilities in each of your colonies can hold up to 
100 of each cargo type. Your carpenters can construct a larger 
warehouse.

{A warehouse can hold up to 200 of each cargo type.}



{WAREHOUSE EXPANSIONS}
Normally, a warehouse can hold up to 200 of each cargo type. Your 
carpenters can construct an expansion to the warehouse, which adds 
another 100 to the total capacity. A warehouse with an expansion looks 
exactly like the normal warehouse, but a "2" is superimposed on it.



{stables}
Stables are built in a colony to {increase breeding of horses.} Once the 
stables are completed, {horse reproduction is doubled.}



{CUSTOM HOUSE}
After {Peter Stuyvesant} has joined the Continental Congress, your 
carpenters may construct custom houses. A custom house serves as a 
permanent arrangement between the colony that constructs it and the 
mother country. {Once completed, you sell goods and commodities on a 
regular basis to Europe,} and the logistics are taken care of for you. 
You no longer have to load and unload cargo or move the ships.

{A custom house also allows trade with Europe to continue after the 
Rebellion has begun; otherwise, access to European markets is closed.}



{PRINTING PRESS}
Printing presses and newspapers provide a forum for public expression. 
This public forum can create a sense of community and brotherhood which 
generates feelings of patriotism within a colony.

{When the the printing press is completed, Liberty Bell production 
within the colony is increased by 50%%.} 



{newspaper}
Newspapers provide a forum for public expression of concerns facing the 
people. This public forum can create a sense of community and 
brotherhood which generates feelings of patriotism within a colony.

{When the the newspaper is completed, Liberty Bell production within 
the colony is increased by 100%%.}



{WEAVER'S HOUSE}
A new strain of cotton is used by the Indians in America, and some 
colonists work with it to weave a fine grade of cloth. {A colonist working 
in the weaver's house can produce cloth} if there is cotton available to 
work with. Any cloth produced accumulates in the warehouse.



{WEAVER'S SHOP}
A weaver's shop in a colony {increases the output of cloth by any 
weavers}. The colony must have a {population of at least 4} to begin 
construction of a weaver's shop.



{TEXTILE MILL}
A weaver's shop may be upgraded into a textile mill. A textile mill 
dramatically increases the efficiency of operations and thus produces 
{more cloth per unit of cotton.} Your Continental Congress must contain 
{Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at least 8} to 
begin construction of this facility.



{TOBACCONIST'S HOUSE}
Some of the colonists have discovered tobacco from the natives and are 
already learning how to cure and dry the weed and to make cigars from it. 
Someday, this crop may grow into a major industry.

{A colonist working in the tobacconist's house can produce cigars if there 
is tobacco available.} Any cigars produced accumulate in the warehouse.



{TOBACCONIST'S SHOP}
A tobacconist's shop in a colony {increases the output of cigars} by any 
tobacconists. The colony must have a {population of at least 4 } to begin 
construction of a tobacconist's shop.



{CIGAR FACTORY}
The tobacconist's shop may be upgraded into a cigar factory. A cigar 
factory dramatically increases the efficiency of operations, and thus 
produces {more cigars per unit of tobacco.} Your Continental Congress 
must contain {Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at 
least 8} to begin construction of this facility.



{RUM DISTILLER'S HOUSE}
In some areas, fine cane sugar can be cultivated; some of the natives 
cultivate large fields of it. The colonists know that it can be processed to 
produce rum.

{A colonist in the distiller's house can produce rum if there 
is sugar on hand to work with.} The rum is bottled and stored in the 
warehouse.



{RUM DISTILLERY}
A rum distillery in a colony {increases the output of rum} by any 
distillers. The colony must have a {population of at least 4} to begin 
construction of a distillery.



{RUM FACTORY}
A distillery may be upgraded into a rum factory. A rum factory 
dramatically increases the efficiency of operations, and thus produces 
{more rum per unit of sugar.} Your Continental Congress must contain 
{Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at least 8} to 
begin construction of this facility.

{FUR TRADER'S HOUSE}
One of the first things your colonists notice when they get to America is 
the incredible abundance of fur-bearing mammals and the tremendous 
use that some of the Indians make of these pelts. They also realized the 
profit that can be made from selling the fur or making clothing from it. 

{A colonist working in the fur trader's house can produce coats,} if there 
is fur available to work with. The coats will accumulate in the warehouse.



{FUR TRADER'S SHOP}
A fur trader's shop in a colony {increases the output of coats} by any 
traders. The colony must have a {population of at least 4 } to begin 
construction of a fur trader's shop.




{COAT FACTORY}
A fur trader's shop may be upgraded into a coat factory. A coat factory 
dramatically increases the efficiency of operations, and thus produces 
{more coats per unit of fur.} Your Continental Congress must contain 
{Adam Smith} and the {population of the colony must be at least 8} to 
begin construction of this facility.



{CARPENTER'S SHOP}
The community builds a carpenter's shop because of the obvious need for 
constructing all sorts of items for the good of the community. A colonist 
working in a carpenter's shop {produces hammers,} which accumulate 
{to construct buildings} and structures in the settlement. Note, however, 
that the carpenter {needs lumber to create hammers.}



{LUMBER MILL}
The humble carpenter's shop can be improved and upgraded to make those 
working there more effective. You may upgrade a carpenter's shop into 
a lumber mill when the {population of the colony reaches 3.} It {doubles 
the output of hammers} from any colonists working there (but requires 
an equal amount of lumber, of course).



{church}
A church may be constructed almost immediately upon landing on the 
shores of the New World. The {population of a colony need only be 3.} This 
causes {increased cross production} instantly, but putting colonists to 
work in the new structure creates many more.



{cathedral}
A church may be upgraded to a cathedral when the {population reaches 8,} 
dramatically {increasing the colony's cross production} and that of any 
colonists preaching there.



{BLACKSMITH'S HOUSE}
The Colonial community helps build the blacksmith's house for much the 
same reasons as the carpenter's shop. They realize the need for basic 
metal goods -- tools, repairs of existing implements, and so on. {A 
colonist working in the blacksmith shop can produce tools,} which 
accumulate in the settlement's warehouse. The blacksmith {needs ore} to 
produce tools.



{BLACKSMITH'S SHOP}
A Blacksmith's House may be expanded into a larger facility that 
{increases the production of tools.} You may begin the project when the 
colony's {population reaches 4.}



{IRON  WORKS}
Your colonists may construct an Ironworks when the {population of the 
colony reaches 8.} It is a major facility for metal-working/production 
and dramatically {increases tool output.} The Ironworks is a factory level 
building and may not be built until {Adam Smith} joins your Continental 
Congress.
