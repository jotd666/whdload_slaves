GENERAL HINTS AND TIPS:
  As you encounter monsters in the levels above, be sure to have all of your
party members participate in battles. Your champions experience levels raises
in proportion to how much they accomplish or attempt. Plan team efforts be-
fore battling. Conserve torches. Use Light spells when possible, and store
your torches away for those times when MANA is important. Put out your torch
while you sleep.

  Scrolls themselves have no use, other than to provide guidance and instruc-
tions (One important exception is the Magic Map Scroll). You may wish to use
the scrolls as path markers or weight on Pressure Plates. If one of your
Champions dies, be sure to pick up their bones, and equipment if possible,
and go resurrecting him/her/it. Keys disappear (stick in the lock ?) when
they have successfully opened a lock. (Some exceptions to this exist).

  Learn which champion can cast which spells. Eventually, you will notice
which spells/potions kill each type of monster easily. Learn which weapons
work best with which champions. Don't carry too much stuff around where you
don't have to. Your characters get hungry and tired faster if the load score
is yellow, or even worse red.

  Save the game position to disk regularly, especially before dangerous moves
and after a tough portion of the game. If your champion has not enough MANA
to chant a spell in total, chant as many syllables as possible and then
sleep. When you awaken you can chant the remainder of the spell. You may pre-
chant a spell for each champion and keep them at the ready in case you run
into some surprising situations.

  You should also know that objects/weapons to be used must be placed in the
right hand/on other bodypart. Best use of chests is to store one type of item
together in each chest (food in one, clothing and armor in another, etc).
  The Weapons and Armor left by deceased Deth Knights, plus Biter, seems to
cursed. Exactly what influence (if any) these curses have upon the Items'
Characterisics is unknown to me.

COMMMENTARIES TO THE ITEM LISTS:
  Contrary to the situation in Dungeon Master, there are here some Items,
that not always exist in the same place or even exist somewhere. These Items
are divided into two main groups, Giggler Items and Gifts in Treasure-Pil-
lars. (Apart from those, at least a Compass and two Chests; one full of mixed
food and containing Gem of Ages and 4 Magical Boxes, can appear in different
places.

  GIGGLER ITEMS - Most of the Gigglers you kill will, apart from the things
they have stolen from you, yield some Items. These will be (with one notable
exception) different each time, but will be chosen from the following (preli-
minary) list. In one place in Level 6 and two in Level 10, Giggler Items
may be found lying on the floor.

        Water (-skin)           Sapphire Key
        Magical Box (Blue)      Gold Key
        Magical Box (Green)     Onyx Key
        Stormring               Key of B
        Eye of Time             Lock Picks
        VEN Potion              Rabbit's Foot
        FUL Bomb

  GIFTS FROM TREASURE-PILLARS - A Treasure-Pillar is a Pillar with Niches in
all four sides, with Items in them. In almost all cases, two or more sides of
the same pillar cannot be reached from the same corridor. In these Pillars
there are some standard Items, that always is there, like GOR Coins, Dragon
Steaks et.c. In addition to that, however there often are more valuable Gifts
there, never more than one of each sort. Those Gifts until now found is as
follows:

        Dragon Helm             RA Blade
        Dragon Plate            Diamond Edge
        Plate of RA             Flamitt
        Dragon Poleyn           Wand
        Poleyn of RA            Magical Box (Green)
        Dragon Greave           KU Potion
        Greave of RA            Gold Key
        Storm                   Topaz Key

  CHEST CONTENTS - One of the Variable-Position-Chests contains Dragon Steak,
Shank, 2 Cheeses, 2 Breads, Corn and Apple, the other one contains 3 Magical
Boxes G, Magical Box B and Gem of Ages.


CREATURE/ITEM LIST AND HINTS

PRISON LEVEL ONE - (The Prison Level)

 Creatures :    None

  24 New Heroes are found here, 22 of which are easily found and 2 which are
somewhat harder to get. All of them are very powerful in Levels, Character-
istics and Skills by Dungeon Master standard but have no equipment. Two Illu-
sionary Walls are present, which lead to Stairs down.
  There are two small enclaves, which can only be reached from below. If you
want to have Kazai Shadow Warrior you must open the Door in front of him by
examining any of the undead fellows. If you instead want Lor Champion of Good
you should not, as this not only opens the Door to Kazai, but also closes the
Door to Lor. As far as I know you can't have them both in a party.


PRISON LEVEL TWO - (The 'Non-Existent' Level)

 Creatures :    Mummies
                Rock Piles

FOOD            WEAPONS          CLOTHING/ARMOR   KEYS      MISCELLANOUS
                Rocks                                       Boulders

  Contrary to the text at the entrance there is a second Level in the Prison,
and Monsters too ! In the section to Kazai there are about 9 Rock Piles, use
Poison-Gas spells. In the other compartment on the way to Lor, there are
about 23 Mummies, against which for example Fireballs are effective.


LEVEL ONE - (The Cellar Level)

 Creatures :    Gigglers
                Armored Worms (Brown)
                Red Dragon

FOOD            WEAPONS          CLOTHING/ARMOR   KEYS      MISCELLANOUS

                                                            FUL Bomb (2)
                                                            2 FUL Bombs (4)
                                                            FUL Bomb (6)
                                                            GOR Coin
                                                            Chest

                                                            Calista
Giggler Items                                               Moonstone


MONSTERS:
  The Armored Worms (here brown) are rather alike the Purple Worms in Dun-
geon Master, but are more vicious and powerful. They can appear both single
and in pairs, and is killed by weapons or Fireballs. They leave some Worm
Rounds behind. The Gigglers you also know from DM, they steal your equipment
and then run away. Kill them at once. In the remains you find your stolen
property and often other items as well.
  The Dragon takes, as usual, an incredible amount of damage before it dies.
Most forms of attack are effective against it, but have a Fireshield on if
you go into melee with him. Dragons leave about 10 pieces of Dragon Steak,
and sometimes - as here - other things as well behind.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  Two nearly bottomless shafts penetrating the whole dungeon are finally
reaching bottom here. In one you will have to drop and lose every item you
have to be free again. In both cases you'll come to a Forcefield that will
teleport you back to the Fountain in Neutral Level 5.

KU SECTION :
  Kill the Dragon for the items it has, and Worms for food. Two Illusionary
Walls here. Nearby one of them is a Button, which opens a Secret Panel within
the Illusion. The lock there craves an Onyx Key, but can be picked. The other
Illusion leads to a Forcefield, teleporting you to THE JUNCTION on Level 3.
There are three Staircases up from here.

ROS SECTION :
  Two Illusionary walls, one of them in front of the Staircase up, the other
leading to the Forcefield to THE JUNCTION. Worms reform here.

NETA SECTION :
  One Illusionary Wall, leading to the Forcefield aimed at THE JUNCTION, and
one case of Stairs up. Do not step on the square, where the chest and the
others lie. You'll get trapped and call up a vast horde of Worms. The walls
around you will occasionally open just to let in some Worms to eat you,
unfortunately, it will close immediately after you have killed them and you
won't get out. Take the items from each side instead.

DAIN SECTION :
  A Panel is blocking the Stairs up, so to have got here, you must have
fallen/climbed down a Pit. A Button removes the Panel. As usual, one Illu-
sionary Wall before the corridor to the Forcefield mentioned above.

Giggler Items                                               FUL Bomb (5)


MONSTERS:
  The Mummies are rather easily killed by weapons or Fireballs, but in com-
pensation they are quite a crowd. The Vexirks (Undead black-robed meanies) is
doubtlessly the most powerful type of monster here. They are killed by weap-
ons or spells (a lot). They almost always leave some items behind.
  Muncher is a singularily unfriendly lobster-like monster called. They levi-
tate, move very fast, occur in groups, hit almost always with their three (!)
mouths and on top of that are poisonous. Fortunately they don't take much
damage before dying, Fireballs being most effective. Deth Knights are Knights
clad in armor and skull-helmets, with spells being ineffective against them,
use weapons. They leave behind their weapons and armor, all cursed.
The Gigglers are as said before.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  A copy of THE JUNCTION on Level 3 is here. You may get here by teleporting.

KU SECTION :
  Near the false JUNCTION is an Altar of VI, and an Illusionary Wall leads
out to the rest of the KU Section. The central hall is a Muncher regeneration
place. There are three Stairs down and two up here.

  VEXIRK CULT - Kill the two Vexirks guarding the entrance (Fireshield recom-
mended) and push two Buttons to open Grate. The third Button materializes 2
Deth Knights behind you. Kill Knight and get to the Door. Don't let a closed
Door stop you ! Kill off all the about 16 Vexirks inside. It is a good idea
to place yourselves in such a way that they cast spells on each other. Inside
is a Fountain and an Illusionary Wall with an Iron Key lock.

  EXECUTIONER'S TOMB - Here are three Grates with controling Pressure Plates
in front of them, but they're slow and the first can be bypassed. Four Deth
Knights to kill. When you take Executioner they all come forward, a Grate in
the entrance closes and a Secret Panel to MUMMY LAIR opens. The Grate can
also be closed by pushing a Button, and opened by placing something in Exe-
cutioner's niche.

  MUMMY LAIR - The Doors here can be chopped or blasted open. Look out for
Pit-traps. After some time another Panel to EXECUTIONER'S TOMB opens.

ROS SECTION :
  At the false JUNCTION an Altar of VI. An Illusionary wall hides the Stairs
down. Another makes it possible to bypass the locked Door to the North. The
lock is pickable from the inside. There are two sets of Stairs up from here.

  INSIDE LOCKED DOOR - The lever controls the Pit. The lock towards N takes
an Onyx Key. The Pressure Plate removes a Panel, behind which there's an
Illusionary Wall which leads to a secret room.

  PIT AND FORCEFIELD - Stand with your back at the Pit and shoot or throw
something pointed (Arrow, Dart et.c) into the Forcefield. It will be tele-
ported to the back off you and turned around and will with some luck pass
through the Grate and land on a Pressure Plate behind it, thereby closing
the Pit.

NETA SECTION :
  The usual Altar of VI at the JUNCTION copy. The Square Key from the Vexirk
suits the lock and opens the Panel behind the door. Invisible Pressure Plates
on each side of the Door closes it. An invisible Plate in the inner room
calls forth another Vexirk. The Forcefield teleports you to the SCREAMER ROOM
in Level 3.

DAIN SECTIONS :
  Three sections with no physical interconnection.

  MUNCHER LAIR - An Altar of VI at the false JUNCTION. An invisible Pressure
Plate at the Demon Head opens up to the inner lair. Hi-power Poison Gas most
effective against them.
  Stand at the Altar, go 2 paces South, turn to east and then to west, step
forward and you will be teleported to SE SECTION.

  SE SECTION - Step Forward or you will be teleported back. The Forcefield
takes you to the SW SECTION on Level 3.

  NW SECTION - Just a small corridor with one Staircase up and one down.


LEVEL THREE - (The Junction Level)

 Creatures :    Gigglers
                Screamers
                Rock Piles
                Munchers
                Deth Knights
                Greater Oitus

FOOD            WEAPONS          CLOTHING/ARMOR   KEYS      MISCELLANOUS
Shank           Biter (cursed)   Kirtle           Iron      Magical Box G
Screamer Slices 3 Poison Darts   Gunna            Gold      Horn of Fear
                3 Rocks          Cloak of Night   Onyx      Yew Staff
                                                  Skeleton

                Rocks            Torso Plates (cursed)
                Swords (cursed)  Leg Plates (cursed)
                                 Foot Plates (cursed)


MONSTERS:
  Gigglers as before, Screamers is relatively harmless and easy to kill, you
get Screamer Slices from them to eat. The Slow-moving Rock Piles have very
thick armor and is easiest killed by Poison Gas spell or by dropping a Grate
on them. Do not stand close to them, they have the ability to critically hit
(or is it eat ?) you and instantly kill your characters no matter how many
hit points they have.
  The Munchers and Deth Knights are described above. The Oitus (Spider-kin)
are rather deadly. They can however be scared away with WAR CRY.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  THE JUNCTION - Here is the place where you decide what way to go, KU, ROS,
NETA, or DAIN. You get to here by teleportation from several other places.

KU SECTION :
  At THE JUNCTION there's an Altar of VI, but when you move out in the corri-
dor you are soundlessly teleported to the rather alike area around the false
JUNCTION at level 2, just to confuse you. At the other end of this corridor
there are Stairs down. A Panel can be opened from here to another small area
from the other side using a Skeleton Key. Here there are six Oitus, and one
Staircase up and one down.

ROS SECTION :
  An Altar at THE JUNCTION. There is a Secret Panel by it, leading to a small
room withe Stairs up and down, removable by a Skeleton Key from that small
room. Go farther east and you're teleported down to the false counterpart in
Level 2. This can be avoided by not having with you the three Poison Darts
you found here.

  NINJA THROWING TEST - Two Rocks in a crack in the wall. Avoid the Dagger-
throwing Cannons at the Demon Head. Throw Rocks or Daggers (or smthn else)
on the Pressure Plates, seing to that they pass when the Forcefield is not
there. Pull the Lever to open the door and finish off the Rock Heaps there.
By now two passages to the EASTERN CORRIDOR should have opened.

  EASTERN CORRIDOR - An Iron Key in a crack near the Stairs down, the Lever
there controls a Pit. In the other end there's another Lever and a Pressure
Plate with unknown purpose. Hear is also an Illusionary Wall, and there are
two more in the long corridor behind it.

NETA SECTION :
  The usual Altar at THE JUNCTION, then teleportation to Level 2 counterpart.

  SCREAMER ROOM - Apart from some Screamers and several appearing Oitus are
there here an Illusionary Wall with Stairs down. The N door leads back to
THE JUNCTION, and the other to GIGGLERS' HEAVEN

  GIGGLERS' HEAVEN - As the name suggests, are there Gigglers here. Look out
for Pits and Pit-traps when chasing them. Connection to MUNCHER HOLE in SE.
Here's one Giggler, who always (!) has a Skeleton Key on him.

  MUNCHER HOLE - At every step in this room, some Munchers come up through
the hole by the Demon Head. A Staircase up.

DAIN SECTION :
  Of course a VI Altar at the beginning at THE JUNCTION. Teleportation to
the Level 2 counterpart.

  SW SECTION - Stairs up. Stepping on the Pressure Plates at the center will
open all Grates and generate Oitus. Some Monster Boundaries exist.

  SE SECTION - Back to THE JUNCTION

  NE SECTION - Stairs up.

  NW SECTION - The Forcefields pushes you through them, or pushes you through
to one side, or turns you around, or refuses to do anything, all depending on
from which direction you come from. You will have to map it out. Stairs up
and down here.

Gifts in Treasure-Pillar                                    FUL Bomb (2)


MONSTERS:
  The Gigglers and Mummies are described above. Rives are immaterial beings,
which when not attacking hardly can be seen. Water Elementals are blue pools
that can pass through Grates, but not Doors. Both sorts you kill with Vorpal
Blades or Dispell. The Club-wielding Ant-men are not that difficult, but when
encountered in large numbers, it can be hard.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  None on this Level.

KU SECTION :
  One Staircase up and one down, and two Illusionary Walls here. (And a lot
of Ant Men). Behind one of the Illusions there are a Treasure-Pillar. In the
niches in such Pillars may, in addition to the standard items always found,
there be various more precious gifts, different each time. If you come from
Level 3, you will be teleported to the other Illusion, together with all
items you or your opponents drop on that square, as soon as you step out of
the Stairs.

ROS SECTION :
  If you take out the Torch of the Holder, then a Panel will open, as well as
a Pit behind you. Around the Panel there's one set of Stairs up, and one
down. An Illusionary Wall guards the entrance to a corridor to the Treasure-
Pillar. The Pressure Plate controls a Pit-trap in SPINUSION.

  SPINUSION - Here are no less than nine Illusionary Walls, one Pit, and one
Pit-trap. Two Spinners are on each side of the pit. A case of Stairs upwards
is also situated here.

NETA SECTION :
  Here we have an invisible Pressure Plate that generates Mummies, 2 Pit-
traps, 4 cells with Pressure Plates inside and one locked Door. Generate a
Mummy, draw it to an empty cell, CALM it so that it goes in, and close the
door. When you've filled all four cells, the Door should open and one of the
Pit-traps close. The Button behind it opens a Panel to a secret room. Behind
an Illusionary Wall is an oscillating Panel. Wait until it opens, then get in
to the Treasure-Pillar. A Fountain and one Staircase in each direction exists
here.

DAIN SECTIONS :
  Here are four not physically interconnected sections.

  W SECTION - LAUGHING PIT - An irregularly oscillating Pit closes the way.
Stairs down. There's a Staircase up too, behind a Panel, which is open if you
come down from above. If you go back from RIVE LAIR to here a soundless tele-
porter will take you to CENTRAL SECTION.

  W SECTION - RIVE LAIR - Four Doors, the first has a lock, but all four can
be blasted up. An invisible Pressure Plate after the first Door opens a Grate
a bit down the corridor. After that Grate another visible Plate closes it
again. By now you should meet the very numerous Rives and some Water Elemen-
tals too. The Lever opens the Grate to the Staircase up, and the Button tele-
ports you back to LAUGHING PIT.

  S SECTION - This small room you reach by the Stairs from SW SECTION in
Level 3.

  CENTRAL SECTION - When you have been teleported here, just go S to teleport
back. Shoot a Fireball into the Forcefield to kill the Ant Men behind the
door. Then go through the open Door and cast an Open/Close spell into the
Forcefield. This should open the Grate and close the Pit-trap, so that you
may pass. Inside the Door a Panel will disappear, so that you can reach the
Treasure-Pillar. The Button turns the Teleporter in LAUGHING PIT off so that
you can pass through there.

  THE CISTERN - To get here you'll have to climb down any of the Pits in
PROVE YOU ARE A WIZARD or COUATL SPIRAL on Level 5. Two Staircases up and one
down is situated here in this compartment, two of them are blocked by Panels,
(Buttons nearby), and the third by a locked Door. Some Forcefields is block-
ing your way to the North, a few of them oscillating. A locked Door leads to
a small room from which an Illusionary Wall takes you to a corridor. By using
this way you can bypass th Forcefields altogether.

Giggler Items                                               Rabbit's Foot


MONSTERS:
  The Slime Devils are disgusting-looking Poison Bolt-throwing lumps of green
of medium toughness. The Couatls on the other hand are large, winged snakes.
They fly very fast, have powerful attacks and are of course venomous, Fire-
balls being the most effective weapon against them. Gigglers and Rives as de-
scribed before.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  The Pressure Plates turns the Forcefield to THE JUNCTION on, while insert-
ing Iron Keys into the Locks turns it off. There's a Fountain and two Stairs
up here.

KU SECTION :
  An Altar of VI, an Illusionary Wall, and a set of Stairs in each direction.

ROS SECTIONS :
  NW SECTION - An Altar and a Staircase down.

  SE SECTION - Stairs up and down.

NETA SECTIONS :
  PURGATORY - A lot of soundless Teleporters in the big hall. To pass through
the hall, stand in the S entrance, move six steps N, W, N, W, and then North.
Stairs up and down.

  SLIME DEVIL ROOM - Get into here by climbing down a Pit on Level 6. Button
to open the Grate at the Stairs up is situated inside an Illusionary Wall.

DAIN SECTIONS :
  When you go up from RIVE LAIR on Level 4, you'll come to a short corridor,
from where you will be teleported to the great NE area. Here's another Stair-
case down.

  PING-PONG FIREBALLS - Here Fireballs flies back and forth between Force-
fields. When you take the Vorpal Blade new Fireballs are generated, as well
as some Rives. The two Buttons call forth Slime Devils. Both the Door and the
Grate can be blasted up. If you follow the long corridor behind the Door, you
will pass a room and some openings, all of which are blocked by Pits. Here's
also a Staircase down and 2 Fountains. The Grate leads to PROVE YOU ARE A
WIZARD.

  PROVE YOU ARE A WIZARD - Here are some opening and closing Pits. It's ad-
visable to open those Grates with Couatls inside (with Open/Close spell), and
kill them one at a time. When you step on the Pressure Plate before the Eye,
all Grates are opened. Then you should make a ZOKATHRA spell and place it
against the Eye. This will teleport you to THE BRIDGE. The Button removes
a Panel, you can com back here later from THE BRIDGE to push it.

  THE BRIDGE - The Button momentarily removes a Panel at your side, so that
you can pass through. Stepping on the Pressure Plate takes you back a bit. If
you push the Button and then quickly back to the Bridge you'll be transported
to the COUATL SPIRAL. A Pit-trap is here.

  COUATL SPIRAL - Warning for Pit-traps. the Button removes a Panel to a
Staircase down. The three Buttons removes three Panels, but only the W one is
important. Go SW and throw something over the Pit to the Pressure Plate, this
will close the Pit to your North. Go through both Illusionary Walls to the
Green Buttons. Push the left one first, then the right one. Take the Key and
get back (Watch out for a new Pit-trap). Unlock, take the stuff and get into
the W corridor (Stairs up and down).

MONSTERS:
  The Armoured Worms are of the yellow variety on this Level, and apart from
the color they are just the same. The Flying Eyes cast Lightnings and are
rather bothersome, especially in SUPPLIES FOR THE QUICK. Scorpions can take
a great deal of bashing before dying, Fireballs are also rather effective.
Golems are immune to Magick and can only be killed with raw violence or
Doors/Grates, they don't have that many hit points, but is difficult to hurt.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  START ROOM - After having used the 'Make New Adventure' option, your party
is teleported here into the start room, bereaved of all their possesioms,
with only their Characteristics, Levels and Skills intact. One Worm is al-
ready here, but as you are teleported right onto a Pressure Plate, two more
immediately materializes. Move quickly away from them, let there be Light,
and begin killing them (with Magick, you have no weapons as yet, and fighting
them barehanded is not a good idea). It is important that you don't get any
wounds (hurt bodyparts) now, as you have no means of healing yet and you must
be able to move at full speed soon.
  Collect the various items here, but don't step on the Pressure Plate unless
you want more Worms to worry about. Use GOR coins to purchase items from the
small rooms (You haven't enough Coins to open all now, but you should always
take the room with Compass, Rope and Magic Map). An Illusionary Wall is here.
The Grate is opened with the Iron Key, but it is better to take RUN AND JUMP,
opened by placing a Torch into the Holder. If you return to here later on,
some items (different each time) might be found here, lying on the Pressure
Plate).

  RUN AND JUMP - Step quickly seven steps forward and the Pit will close just
in time for you to get across. If you're overloaded or hurt you won't move
fast enough and fall down to THE JUNCTION on Level 3.

  SOUTH CORRIDORS - At the RUN AND JUMP Pit, enter the southern corridor.
With the right timing you should be able to get the Flask and then exit
(eastward is best). To the West is a Staircase down, and a closed Door. The
Locks are opened by Iron Keys.

  SUPPLIES FOR THE QUICK - A lot of useful objects can be found here if you
are cool and fast enough. It is necessary to map out all unsafe squares (and
the few safe ones). You can close some Pits if you have Iron Keys enough.
Two Illusionary Walls are here nearby. In the central Niche-Pillar you may
later in the game find more objects, different every time. The Stairs up can
only be used in the opposite direction.

KU SECTION :
  An invisible Pressure Plate regenerates the Scorpion.

ROS SECTION:
  The Pressure Plate activates the Fireball Cannons, and the lever the Force-
field. The Buttons open a Secret Panel and a Grate, respectively. Push the
'Button' in the Demon room and you'll get a Gem, at the same time as you
turn the Cannons on (the Fireballs are turned around by the Forcefields and
can blast through these Doors, as your Fireballs also can. The hexagonal
Pressure Plates here regenerates Scorpions. Once you've done this the Door
to the room with the Stairs up opens.

  DEATH ROW - This Jail can only be opened from the inside after having
fallen down from Level 8. The inner Grate opens after a while, and the Golem
has the Key for your exit.

NETA SECTION :
  In the Pit Room the squares without Pits activate the Poison-Gas Cannons.
The corners are in addition to that Spinners. Cross the room Clockwise, to
minimize poisoning, but you always become hit some times. One of the Stairs
up and one of the Stairs down both lead to Grates which you cannot pass.
Climb into these rooms from above instead.

DAIN SECTION :
  Just a Corridor.

Compass might be here


MONSTERS:
  The Skeletons are rather easy opponents, kill them with your weapons. There
are at least 14 Dragons on this level, and they have very varying size. The
Dragon in the Neutral area is extremely big, those in the KU area are medium,
while those in the ROS and NETA areas are relatively small and weak (for be-
ing a Dragon, of course). The Gigglers and Mummies are described before.

NEUTRAL SECTIONS :
  Although all the Paths (KU, RROS, NETA, and DAIN) converge here, only the
Staircase you entered by is accessible. The others are blocked by Panels. A
Sapphire Key suits the locked Door, inside there are a Fountain and an Auto-
mat for purchasing items. By placing GOR Coins into the Slot, you get items
of increasing value. They drop down in either of the two Niches (One is in-
side an Illusion). Totally eleven items can be purchased, Coins inserted
after that are lost. There's two Staircases down and one up here.
  If you fall down a certain Pit you will stand on a Plate that delivers
Poison Gas each time you turns. Illusion to E leads to a Forcefield that
teleports you up again. At the Cross Lock stairs up. Gold Key opens to Trea-
sure-Pillar. Cross Key opens a Panel at the Level above.

  ONE WAY DOORS - To get here, enter a Pit in the DIABOLICAL DEMON DIRECTOR
in Level 8. Two invisible and two visible Pressure Plates are in the greater
part. The visible ones control the Doors in front of the Stairs, one up and
one down. In addition to that here's a Dragon of tremendous strength. The
Lock in the small part takes a Gold Key, the Pressure Plate manouevres a
Panel to the greater part, and there are Stairs up. Inside the Gold Key Door
there is a Treasure-pillar.

  SKELETON ROOM - Use the invisible Pressure Plate to generate a Skeleton,
CALM it and make it move to the Grate. Push the Button to turn on the Force-
field which will teleport the Skeleton past the Grate. With luck, the Skel-
eton won't move away immediately, if it does, do it again with another one.
If a Skeleton stands inside the Grate a couple of seconds, it will be hit by
some Lightnings and die, and the Grate will open. If you want to go the ROS
Path, push the Eye with any object (This will close a Pit on Level 8), if ya
wanna go NETA, just proceed. One Staircase up here.

KU SECTION :
  There are three Staircases up here.

  DRAGON DEN - A central room with five smaller rooms around, each containing
a Red Dragon of great strength. All Dragon rooms are interconnected by Illu-
sionary Walls, but only three of them is connected to the central room, and
is blocked by Grates. All Grates here you can blast open. Unfortunately for
you, so can the Dragons.
  An invisible Pressure Plate closes the Grate at the entrance. Push the Eye
with Powertowers to open panel. Dragons regenerate slowly (hatch ?).

ROS SECTION :
  MEGA ILLUSION - One staircase down here. In this great room there's no less
than 75 ! Illusionary Walls. Among them are small rooms, some of which con-
tain valuables, some Dragons. There's seven Dragons here, although they're
not that strong. There's one Spinner too. Gold Key to open a Panel in to the
Treasure-Pillar.

NETA SECTIONS :
  The NW room you reach by climbing down a Pit on Level 8. Kill the Skeleton,
and you can get out, down to Level 6.

  FLAME THE THIEF - Use Tourquoise Key to open Door (You come from SKELETON
ROOM). Gold Key to open Door to Treasure-Pillar, and temporarily open a Panel
to an adjacent room. If you try picking the Lock, only the Panel will open,
and Fireballs will be shot at you. The adjacent room contains two Forcefields
and two Pit-traps. The Pit-traps will let you fall all the way down to Level
1, and the Forcefield will teleport you away, one to Level 2, and one to
Level 5. There's one Illusion and one staircase up here.

  DRAGON AND MUMMIES - You get here by climbing into a pit on Level 9. Kill
Dragon and one of the Pits will close so that you can get out. The Pressure
Plate opens a Panel to the SKELETON ROOM. An invisible Pressure Plate regen-
erates Mummies.

DAIN SECTION :
  None.

 Creatures :    Gigglers
                Rock Piles
                Stone Golems

Gifts in Treasure-Pillar
Var-Pos Chests and Compass might be here                    Boulders


MONSTERS:
  Demons are powerful, serpent-tailed, Fire-breathing adversaries that have
quite some hit points. Black Flames are stationary, but can live up again
many times. They are killed (most temporarily) by Vorpal Blades or Dispell.
All the others; Gigglers, Rock Piles, Golems and Deth Knights are described
above.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  DIABOLICAL DEMON DIRECTOR - This is a really fiendish area to be in, both
in respect to problems and to the endlessly regenerating Monsters. Here are
a lot of Black Flames, Pits that always is in the wrong place, Pit-traps, and
Pressure Plates. The Pit ahead of the Niche can be closed by a Button nearby.
There are totally no less than five stairs up and three down from the various
parts of the DEMON DIRECTOR.

  DEMON DIRECTOR - HIGH GROUND - This is a room just East of the entrance.
A Pressure Plate here operates one pit. There are also one more Plate inside
a Forcefield and a Panel, the exact use of which is unknown to us.

  DEMON DIRECTOR - PATH TO KU - To get to KU, to HIGH GROUND and climb into
the Easternmost Pit. Go upstairs again and North, then East (The Poison Can-
nons can be disarmed). Open the Lock with a Solid Key and enter KU.

  DEMON DIRECTOR - PATH TO ROS - Draw a Monster (preferrably a Rock Heap) to
the Pressure Plate behind the two Pits at the entrance, this will close the
Pit to S, for as long as the Monster is there. Move quickly two steps S, then
place something heavy where you stand. Cast a Open/Close spell at the Grate
to the South, and kill the Demon, so that the Pit-trap disappear. Here are
Stairs up and down, and VALUE FOR VALUABLES. If you place five Items here, a
Panel will open. The Cross Lock controls a Grate.
  Get upstairs to Level 9, and go NE to the Stairs down. You are now North of
HIGH GROUND. The Button toggles the Forcefield on/off. Go down to Level 7 and
push some item against the Eye. Get up again, and now when the Pit is closed,
move S, and then E. To remove the Forcefield, you'll have to set the Levers
in all combinations. Proceed and use Emerald Key to open to ROS.

  DEMON DIRECTOR - PATH TO NETA - The same as the Path to ROS, but when down
in SKELETON ROOM, just proceed (Tourquoise Key).

  DEMON DIRECTOR - PATH TO DAIN - The same at the Path to ROS up to Level 9,
there climb down the Pit. You should now be South of HIGH GROUND. The Button
activates the Fireball Cannons farther in, and the Pressure Plate turns it.
on. The Lever closes the nearest Pit. Ruby Key to open Door to DAIN. One
Illusionary wall here.

KU SECTIONS :
  DEAD END - Go so far in the corridor you can, wait until you are cornered
by the Deth Knights, then move E again. The Panel should have opened now.

  ENDLESS CORRIDOR - When you are moving East for the second time, the corr-
idor may seem a little too long. In the end of this corridor you are actual-
ly teleported to the beginning of a similar to the North. (You can teleport
back, just go West). Proceed to near the end of this corridor, push the but-
ton and go downstairs.

  PIT ROOM - Here's a Treasure-Pillar. Stairs up and down. North of here
there's a passage with Stairs in both directions.

ROS SECTION :
  ZOOOM 2 - Remember Zooom from DM ? Here's one more that goes round in the
shape of a slanted 8. One positive thing : it doesn't turn you around in the
corners. You cannot cast or throw anything from here, a Fireball cast here
will explode in your face, even if you have many paces of free space forward.
There are many interesting places to go to around ZOOOM 2. First there are
three corridors to the West. In the Southernmost you are pushed (rather slow)
against a Pit. To reach the Middle one you must remove a Panel with a Button
in ZOOOM 2. There's a Button, which generate a Forcefield, and a Pit which
closes for a few moments by stepping on a Pressure Plate. If you climb down
the Pit you come to a small room with a Forcefield to THE JUNCTION.
  The Northernmost of the Western corridors take you to a locked Door (Gold
Key), with rather much stuff inside. If you want to fall down to DEATH ROW
in Level 6, try picking the Lock. A small room with a Grate is to the North.
Two Illusionary Walls in the Eastern wall leads to a Staircase up. But go
off ZOOOM 2 straight North to proceed with your quest.

  UP AND DOWN - This room consists of four portions, separated by Pits, each
with a Staircase up. Here you must go upstairs, drop back to another portion,
using a Pit, go upstairs again, and so on until you have passed all portions.
From the second portion you can come to PIT ROOM'S Treasure-Pillar.

NETA SECTIONS :
  NETA here consists of three different parts.

  NW SECTION - Drop down to here from Level 9. On the square where you landed
a Pit will open soon. Go through the Forcefield to the Stairs up.

  CENTRAL SECTION - Just a corridor between the Stairs up and down. The Pit
can be closed by placing something on the Pressure Plate.

  PIT ROOM - The Treasure-Pillar and Stairs up.

DAIN SECTION :
  Apart from two small rooms adjacent to Stairs (up and down, respectively),
here is only the Treasure-Pillar in the PIT ROOM (Stairs up).


LEVEL NINE - (The Corbum Level)

 Creatures :    Gigglers
                Hellhounds
                Stone Golems
                Mummies

FOOD            WEAPONS          CLOTHING/ARMOR   KEYS      MISCELLANOUS
Cheese                           Mithral Aketon   Iron      2 Magical Boxes G
Dragon Steak    Stone Clubs      Mithral Mail     Gold      4 Corbums
2 Breads                         Fine Robe (Body)           Ashes
                                 Fine Robe (Legs)           2 Blue Gems

                                                            Empty Flask
Gifts in Treasure-Pillar                                    Crown of Nerra


MONSTERS:
  The Hellhounds are big, black demon dogs that has a fiery breath, and are
preferably killed at distance. Gigglers, Golems and Mummies we have all seen
before.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  HOUNDS AND GIFTS - The only way to here is the Stairs down to DEMON DIREC-
TOR on the underlying Level. Don't step on the Pit-traps. The Forcegrates to
the Treasure-Pillar can be opened by Gold Keys, although at least one of them
can be picked.

  LIGHTNING CANNONS - You get here by following the Path to ROS from the DEM-
ON DIRECTOR. An invisible Pressure Plate opens the Pit at the Demon Face. The
visible one teleports you past the obstacle. The Door leads to the INNER MAZE
and the Button turns the Lightning Cannons on. Another invisible Plate at the
Stairs down turns it off again and closes the Pit. Later might a Panel open a
connection to the NETA Section.

  INNER MAZE - Here's some winding corridors with soundless Teleporters cun-
ningly placed out. Three Illusionary Walls however help you to bypass them,
and reach the Treasure-Pillar. The Buttonless Door leads to OUTER MAZE and is
opened from there by a Skeleton Key.

  OUTER MAZE - Not much to say about, here you come if you fall down a Pit
from Level 10. Two Staircases up, and a connection to INNER MAZE (see above).

KU SECTION :
  The way up from PIT ROOM in Level 8 is closed by a Door (Skeleton Key). The
other way leads past an oddly-shaped Room to the CORBUM ROOM.

  CORBUM ROOM - Here is at last the fabled Corbum Pillar. The Forcegrate in
front of the Stairs up will open when you approach with the Corbum. To get
it, stand on the Pressure Plate until the Pit before the Pillar closes. Then
move N, W, W, S, S, grab it and get back.

ROS SECTIONS :
  One small Room with Stairs up and down is connected to the Eastern stair-
case in ZOOOM 2 (Level 8).

  DOWN AND UP - This is the counterpart to UP AND DOWN in Level 8. Come up
by the Stairs, climb down through the right Pit, repeat until you reach the
Southern corridor past the Forcegrate and the CORBUM ROOM. Four Stairs down
and one up, in all.

  CORBUM ROOM - An Illusionary Wall hides a Button you push to start the
oscillating Pits. Go over the nearest one into the wall, it's an Illusion.
Then go out to the other and immediately West to the Pillar. This nearest
Pit closes when you stand on the second oscillating Pit. Make sure that the
innermost Pit is open when you go to it, if it is not it will open instead.

NETA SECTION :
  FIREBALL CORRIDOR - Blue Gem opens a Panel to an Altar of VI. A series of
invisible Pressure Plates generates Fireballs. All of the Forcefields just
turn the Fireballs around. An Illusionary Wall obstructs the view to a Stair-
case down, and the other one the road to the Treasure-Pillar. You get past
the Pit-trap by pushing the Button(s) and rushing past (Both directions).
The third Button turns the Fireball Cannons off. Some new Forcefields are
created by invisible Plates. Go past yet another Illusion and enter the
CORBUM ROOM.

  CORBUM ROOM - Altar of VI for a Blue Gem. A Button inside an Illusion turns
the oscillating Pit on. Step on Pressure Plate to close Pit at Pillar, and
move there fast when the oscillating one is closed, take Corbum and retirate.
Here are two Staircases, one in each direction.

DAIN SECTION :
  WIZARD ROOM - Two Stairs down and one up, that one behind a Forcegrate.
Leave the Sandals be or a Pit will see to that you fall down to Level 1. The
Door to the CORBUM ROOM is opened by an Iron Key, or by the Button.

  CORBUM ROOM - Button inside Illusionary Wall turns the oscillating Pit on,
and closes the Pit-trap. EYES LIE, there are two Illusionary Pits (!) here.
Step North from the closed Pit-trap onto the 'Pit', West when the oscillating
one is closed and at once North again to the second 'Pit'. Get the Corbum and
move back.


LEVEL TEN - (The FUL YA Level)

 Creatures :    Black Flames
                Armored Worms (Brown)
                Zytazes
                Viper Demons
                Lord Chaos
                Grey Lord

FOOD            WEAPONS          CLOTHING/ARMOR   KEYS      MISCELLANOUS
Cheese          Dragon Fang      2 Boots of Speed 5 Iron    7 GOR Coins
2 Breads        Stick                             Square    Sceptre of Lyf
3 Shanks        2 Rocks                           Master
Corn

Worm Rounds

Giggler Items
Gifts in Treasure-Pillar


MONSTERS:
  A Zytaz is a Black, Ghost-like thing that casts spells on you. Kill them
with Vorpal Blades or Dispell (works only when they are in phase). Lord Chaos
may appear here, you can't kill him, so just avoid him. When you see the Grey
Lord you have won. The rest, Black Flames, Demons and Worms you should have
met many times before.

NEUTRAL SECTION :
  VICIOUS MAZE - Here's a great deal of Mapping to do, Pits and Pit-traps are
common, and there's also Buttons and Locks manouevring Panels. Some Force-
fields exist, most are harmless (well, they turn Fireballs for example). One
however teleports you to another one just alike. By inserting Keys and Coins
in various Locks and Slots you can create more Fireball-turning Forcefields,
to rig up a Monster-slaying machine. One Illusionary wall is here. This area
is interconnected in several places to ZYTAZ HALL and DEMON LAIR. One Stair-
case down there is here. The Buttonless Doors without any Lock leads out from
the various Paths.

  ZYTAZ HALL - As the name suggests the ZYTAZ frequence here is rather high.
Pits, Pit-traps and some Forcefields. Adjacent to the Illusionary Pillar in
the center of the hall is an invisible Pressure Plate that forms a lot of new
Zytazes when stepping on it. A Skeleton Key can open a panel that makes a
shortcut to DEMON LAIR possible. Connection to VICIOUS MAZE and DEMON LAIR.
A case of Stairs down.

  DEMON CHAMBER - A Button influences four Panels, so that the form of this
room may be altered. A Forcefield here teleports you back and forth to the
counterpart in VICIOUS MAZE. Turn it off with the Button. The other Force-
fields either influences Fireballs or teleports you somewhere. Kill off the
whole horde of Demons here, from one of them you'll get a Master Key to open
the Forcegrate to the FUL YA PIT.

  FUL YA PIT - The Forcefield at the Demon Head teleports you to THE JUNC-
TION while the one at the Buttoned Forcegrate disappear as you approach.
Enter and throw the Corbum over the Pit into the 'Black Flame'. The result
should be a Magickal explosion. Go out again, the Forcefield outside the
Forcegrate teleports you to THE JUNCTION to choose next path to go.
  When you throw the fourth Corbum chunk in the FUL YA Pit the Grey Lord
appears and thanks you yet again for saving the world, and you have won.
(If you want to get flambeed, try throwing sumthin else in the FUL YA Pit).

  (Actually I think this ending here is somewhat of an anticlimax, especially
when comparing to Dungeon Master, but the rest is excellent).

KU SECTION :
  The Pits by the Demon can be bypassed. Then you come to a room with a seem-
ingly infinite number of Worms. They are not regenerating, but they sure are
very many. Here you find Dragon Fang, and the Door beside opens when you step
on an invisible Pressure Plate by Dragon Fang's Niche. The KU path connects
to the VICIOUS MAZE.

ROS SECTIONS :
  Here are two different sections. To the smaller one you get from ZOOOM 2 in
Level 8, to proceed, enter the Forcefield and you will be teleported out to
the neutral section.

  STUCK DOORS - This is the part of ROS you reach from the Corbum Room. An
Illusionary Wall connects the first small maze with the second, larger part
with those mysterious Doors, which are stuck halfway between open and closed.
Three ways out to VICIOUS MAZE there are here, three Doors, a Panel, two But-
tons and two Locks.

NETA SECTION :
  The Forcefields double as Spinners. In the inner room inside the locked
Door (Iron Key) there is a Sceptre of Lyf. There are two exits to ZYTAZ HALL,
manouevred by Locks.

DAIN SECTION :
  The Locks to the Forcegrates takes RA Keys. The Forcefield in the left one
teleports you to the Neutral area, and the other leads to a corridor with
some valueables.

  PRESSURE PLATE ROOM - There are GOR Coins in two of the small roomlets, and
a Button in the last one. This opens the exit to the ZYTAZ HALL. About a sec-
ond after you have stepped on a Pressure Plate here a Forcefield materializes
on that square and pushes you to the center of the room, where a Pit opens up
under your feet. (This is a place where you might fall down through all lev-
els to the very bottom).
