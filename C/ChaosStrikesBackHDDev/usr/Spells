Ok heres a few TIPS on what to do with the monsters you will encounter..

MUMMIES:       Easy to kill. Use weapons or spells

SCREAMERS:     Easy enough to kill with axes. Use them for fighting practice
               and as a food source.

OGRES:         These blokes do serious damage to low level characters.. They
               carry clubs which are dropped when killed..

ROCK MONSTERS: These critters move slow and poison chars. Use fireballs or
               poison bombs.

PURPLE WORMS:  Wicked bastards, they hang around in pairs and are quick to
               get at you and poison you. High power fireballs will do the
               trick.

GHOSTS:        Silent and fast and can pass through doors. Use DES EW spell
               to finish em off.

GIANT WASPS:   Quite fast and inject poison into you. Throw fireballs at them
               and avoid hand to hand combat. Be prepared to sleep a while as
               the fireballs will need to be high powered ones.

SLIME CREATURES: Slow and use magic on you, return with the same DES EW spell

FLYING SNAKES:  Fast moving and bloody poisonous kill with a combination of
                high level fire balls and combat.

SKELETONS:      Good chance to try out combat skills.. Easily killed just
                using weapons.

FLOATING EYES:  Thes buggers fight using lightning bolts so give em back to
                them. Also capable of opening doors.

STONE GOLEMS:   Lots of fireballs needed.. They move slowly..

GIGGLING SODS:  These little shits laugh at you and nick your gear.. So bung
                a fireball at em or melee them with a weapon. They steal items
                from left hand but drop em when killed.

GIANT RATS:     Straight hand to hand combat or a bit of magic will see these
                of to the sewers.

RUST MONSTERS:  Just smack em with anything, beware they can do a lot of
                damage.

LITTLE MAGES:   These look like JAWA from Star Wars and fling some pretty
                serious magic at you. They are easy to kill but have a knack of
                transporting themselves next to you or behind you when hit.

GIANT SCORPIONS: Watch for the sting in the tail. Dispose of them with a
                 fireball, but watch out cos they vary in weakness.

WATER ELEMENTALS: Frothy puddles arent as harmless as they seem. Cast a
                  a couple of DES EW spells at them.

ETHEREAL TRIFFIDS: These fade in and out of existence. Use fireballs when solid
                  and DES EW when in ghost form.

GIANT 4 LEGGED:  Fireballs and weapons, but be prepared for a long fight.
SPIDERS

FIRE ELEMENTALS: These immobile plates of coal flare up whenever you approach
                 them. Another case for DES EW to fluff em out.

DEMONS:          These devils are a bit nifty with fireballs so counter
                 attack in the same manner, but be prepared to run if the
                 going gets tuff.

RED DRAGON:      Slow moving but its pretty heavy with fireballs. If you
                 do take it on then be prepared for a long fight.

CHAOS KNIGHTS:   These bloody pain in the necks attack in pairs with two
                 swords a piece. Attack through doorways with high level
                 fireballs.

GENERAL TIPS
Always keep an eye on food and water levels. Its no good getting into a
long combat to find you can't recover afterwards.

Always remember to close doors behind you to stop nasties following you.

More often than not the pits are worth a visit as most of them have useful
items in them!

Remember to save game before entering a new level or area.

End.
