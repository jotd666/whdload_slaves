FALSE WALLS WITHIN THE PRISION!- NUFF SAID.

LEVELS OF EXPERTISE
YOUR CHAMPIONS START OFF WITH ABSOLUTELY NO SKILLS.AS THEY BATTLE THROUGH
THE DUNGEON THEY WILL ATTAIN NEW LEVELS OF SKILLS.IN ORDER FOR YOU TO
RECOGNISE HOW POWERFUL YOUR CHARACTERS ARE.HERE ARE THE LEVELS:

NEOPHYTE , NOVICE , APPRENTICE , JOURNEYMAN , CRAFTSMAN , ARTISAN ,
ADEPT , EXPERT , 1ST LEVEL MASTER , 2ND LEVEL MASTER , 3RD LEVEL MASTER ,
4TH LEVEL MASTER , 5TH LEVEL MASTER , 6TH LEVEL MASTER , ARCHMASTER.

MONSTERS
THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF MONSTERS / CREATURES FOUND WITHIN THE NEW
DUNGEON,AND HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH THEM.I HAVE ADDED SOME OF MY OWN
COMMENTS ON HOW BEST THIS MIGHT BE DONE.

LORD CHAOS'S DUNGEON OFTEN SEEMS INFESTED WITH CREATURES.IT IS WISE TO
KEEP AN EMERGENCY EXIT FREE,JUST IN CASE THINGS GET A LITTLE
HEATED.REMEMBER TO USE STAIRS AND DOORS TO YOUR FULL ADVANTAGE.OF COURSE,
MANY OF THE MONSTERS CARRY A POISONOUS BITE AND ITS THEREFORE WISE TO
PREPARE SOME "VI BRO" POTIONS WITH WHICH TO HEAL YOUR PARTY.

ANTMEN.
LIKE THE BLUE OGRES IN DUNGEON MASTER,THE ANTMAN IS A FEARSOME
WARRIOR.WEILDING HEAVY WOODEN CLUBS THEY PACK A HEAVY PUNCH.USE MEDIUM
POWER POISON CLOUDS,FIREBALLS AND WAR CRIES WHEN DEALING WITH THEM.

FIRE ELEMENTALS.
SUPPOSEDLY FLAMES FROM HELL ITSELF,THE FIRE ELEMENTALS
CAN PROVE TO BE AN UNLIKELY MENACE.DES EW SPELLS ARE THE BEST DEFENCE
AGAINST THESE FIERY OPPONENTS.SOME,MEANWHILE ,BELIEVE THAT THE FLAMES COWER
WHEN A CALM SPELL IS CAST OVER THEM.

COATL
----- THESE FLYING SNAKES ATTACK USING THEIR POWERFUL JAWS.BEWARE,WISE
ADVENTURER,THEY ALSO POSSESS LETHAL VENOMOUS FANGS.POISON CLOUDS AND
FIREBALLS ENSURE THEIR SWIFT DEMISE.WHILE CALM SPELLS,WAR CRIES AND THE
HORN OF FEAR ALSO SEEM TO FRIGHTEN THESE MEDDLESOME CREATURES.

DETH KNIGHT.
THE DETH KNIGHTS ORIGINATE FROM THE DARK AND DISTANT
PAST.THEY ACT AS ARMOURED BODYGUARDS TO LORD CHAOS HIMSELF.FIREBALLS HAVE
VERY LITTLE EFFECT ON THESE TEFFIFYING BEINGS.BRUTE FORCE (USING THE
DIAMOND EDGE WEAPON) AND POISON CLOUDS ARE RECOMMENDED AS THE BEST
DEFENCE.REMEMBER TO KEEP TOPPING UP YOUR FIGHTERS STRENGTH THOUGH.

DEMON.
HALF MAN ,HALF SERPENT THESE HORRIFIC CREATURES TAKE PLEASURE IN
ATTEMPTING TO TOAST YOUR PARTY.PROTECT YOURSELF BY CASTING AN ANTI-FIRE
SPELL AND THEN RETALIATE WITH YOUR OWN FULL-POWER FIREBALLS.POISON CLOUDS
CAN ALSO BE OF SOME EFFECT,WHEN FACED WITH THE NEED TO KILL A DEMON WHO IS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A LOCKED PORTCULLIS.

DRAGON.
THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OF ALL THE CREATURES FOUND IN "DUNGEON MASTER"
WAS THE MAJESTIC DRAGON.CHAOS HAS SEEMINGLY INFESTED PARTS OF HIS DUNGEON
WITH THESE HUGE RED LIZARDS.FIREBALLS,POISON CLOUDS,CHOPPING WEAPONS AND
CUNNING ARE THE BEST DEFENCE AGAINST THEM.BUT DONT FORGET TO CLOSE DOORS
WHEN RETREATING.IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU KILL EVERY DRAGON THAT YOU
FIND,BECAUSE APART FROM BEING A VERY GOOD SOURCE OF FOOD ,THEY ALSO
CONTAIN TREASURE OR VALUABLE KEYS.

FLYING EYE.
YOU DONT REALLY HAVE TO WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THESE STRANGE
LOOKING CREATURES.ALTHOUGH THEY LET FLY WITH FIREBALLS,THEY ARE WEAK AND A
SINGLE FULL-POWERED FIREBALL SHOULD SEND THEM REELING.

GIGGLER.
THE ANNOYING "PAINS IN THE ARSE" THIEVES OF "DUNGEON MASTER" ARE
BACK (BUT IN GREATER NUMBERS).THESE LITTLE FELLOWS DONT HARM YOUR
PARTY,THEY SIMPLY CAUSE TROUBLE.REMEMBER THEY ONLY STEAL FROM YOUR
CHARACTERS LEFT HAND.SO,IF IN DOUBT,LEAVE IT EMPTY.IF YOU CHASE A GIGGLER
,THEY WILL USUALLY LEAD YOU TO A MONSTER.

HELLHOUND.
THE DOGS OF THE DEVIL USUALLY ROAM AROUND IN PAIRS.THEY BREATH
A FIERY BREATH THATS BEST AVOIDED.USE FIREBALLS TO DISPOSE OF THEM AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.DONT FORGET TO COLLECT THE DRUMSTICKS THEY LEAVE
BEHIND,AS THEY MAKE A TASTY MEAL.

LORD CHAOS.
THE DARK ONE HIMSELF.HE ONLY APPEARS ON THE TOPMOST LEVEL OF
THE DUNGEON.IF YOUR UN- LUCKY ENOUGH TO ENCOUNTER HIM,JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE
AS HE CANT BE KILLED.RUN AWAY IF NECESSARY.

MUMMIES.
SAME AS THE ONES FOUND IN "DUNGEON MASTER",BUT IN GREATER
NUMBERS.MUMMIES ARE EASY-MEAT,THEY COWER AT THE SOUND OF THE HORN OF FEAR
OR A WAR CRY.USE THEM FOR WEAPONS PRACTICE BUT REMEMBER TO HAVE A FIRE BALL
READY IN CASE THINGS GET TOO HEATED.

MUNCHER.
THE FLYING RED DEMONS POSSESS THREE RAZOR-TOOTHED MOUTH,THEIR
BITE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE POISON THAT THEY INJECT.DONT WORRY HOWEVER
,BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY KILLED WITH FIRST LEVEL FIREBALLS.

OITU.
HYBRIDS OF THE SPIDERS FOUND IN "DUNGEON MASTER".POISON CLOUDS AND
FIRE BALLS SEEM TO PROVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE.HOWEVER,AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A
GOOD ESCAPE ROUTE,THEY ALSO MAKE GOOD SWORDPLAY TARGETS.REMEMBER TOO ,THAT
THEY SHY AWAY FROM THE HORN OF FEAR,WAR CRIES AND CALM SPELLS.

RIVE.
APPEARING FIRST AS A RIPPLING POOL,THESE ELEMENTAL BEINGS CAN CAUSE
GREAT PAIN.DES EW SPELL WORK WELL,WHILE THE VORPAL BLADE WILL ALSO SORT
THEM OUT.AS A LAST RESORT A BLAST ON THE GOOD OLD HORN OF FEAR OR A CALM
SPELL MAY WELL SEND THEM RUNNING IN TERROR.

ROCK PILE.
ROCK PILES ARE HEAVILY ARMOURED AND THEREFORE IT IS BEST NOT TO
USE WEAPONS AGAINST THEM.ONCE AGAIN FIREBALLS SEEM TO DO THE TRICK,BUT WAIT
UNTIL THEY REAR UP ,FOR THE BEST EFFECT.ALSO WATCH OUT FOR THEIR POISON
FANGS.

SCORPION.
THESE VENOMOUS HULKS SCUTTLE AROUND THE DARKER CORNERS OF THE
DUNGEON.FEARSOME CREATURES,THEY ARE BEST DISPOSED OF QUICKLY AS THEIR
POISON IS VERY LETHAL.AS USUAL,HIGH POWER FIREBALLS ARE THE BEST METHOD OF
DEFENCE.

SCREAMER.
THESE SMALL,TREE-LIKE BEASTS SHRIEK WHEN ATTACKED.USE THEM AS TARGET
PRACTICE FOR YOUR NINJAS AND FIGHTERS.AND THEN FEAST UPON WHAT REMAINS.

SKELETONS.
LEGIONS OF PAST WARRIORS,SKELETONS ENJOY A GOOD SKIRMISH.OBLIGE
AND USE THEM TO PRACTICE ON.IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE ,FIREBALLS ARE THE
ANSWER.

SLIME DEVILS.
THESE GREEN LUMPS OF SLIME LIVE UPTO THEIR NAME.THEY LOB
POISONOUS HUNKS OF SLIME IN YOUR DIRECTION.IT IS THEREFORE NOT ADVISABLE TO
USE HAND WEAPONS ON THEM.KEEP YOUR DISTANCE AND USE FIREBALLS ON THE
SWINES.BUT REMEMBER TO HAVE THE USUAL POISON CURES AT HAND.

STONE GOLEMS.
HEWN FROM GRANITE,THESE STATUESQUE BEINGS CARRY LETHAL STONE
CLUBS THAT CAUSE ENORMOUS DAMAGE TO YOUR PARTY.AVOID THEM IF AT ALL
POSSIBLE ,BUT IF YOU DO HAVE TO CONFRONT THEM ,USE MAGIC BOXES TO FREEZE
LIFE ,THEN ATTACK THEM WITH EVERYTHING YOU HAVE GOT.DONT WORRY THAT WILL
DIE AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF PUNISHMENT.

VEXIRK.
LIKE THE SMALL SORCERERS FOUND IN "DUNGEON MASTER",THESE LITTLE
BEINGS THROW HIGH POWER FIREBALLS,POISON ETC.EITHER GIVE THEM SOME OF THEIR
OWN MEDICINE OR BOX THEM INTO A CORNER OR DEAD END AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS!.

WATER ELEMENTAL.
POOLS OF LETHAL WATER,THESE ELEMENTALS SPRING UP FROM
NOWHERE.ITS POINTLESS CLOSING DOORS ON THEM ,AS THEY SIMPLY SLIP
UNDERNEATH THEM. DES EW SPELLS AND VORPAL BLADES ARE THE BEST MEANS OF
ATTACK,WHILE CALM SPELLS MAY PUT THE FEAR OF GOD INTO THEM.

WORMS.
THE FIRST CREATURE YOU ENCOUNTER.FIREBALLS WORK BEST ON THESE
CREATURES,BUT TRY TO AVOID THEIR FANGS AS THEY INJECT POISON WHICH COULD
PROVE LETHAL.

ZYTAZ.
BLACK GHOST-LIKE APPARITIONS SPORTING A SINGLE EYE,THESE ELEMENTAL
-TYPE BEINGS ARE FOUND ON THE UPPERMOST AREAS OF THE DUNGEON.THEY THROW
FIREBALLS AND POISON CLOUDS IN YOUR DIRECTION.DES EW SPELLS WILL HARM THEM
,BUT I SUGGEST THAT YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE IF POSSIBLE.

WELL THATS ABOUT IT FOR NOW,I DID COMPLETE THE GAME ABOUT A MONTH
AGO,BUT HAVE NOT YET HAD TIME TO SIT DOWN AND TYPE A LIST OF
PUZZLE SOLUTIONS.WHEN I DO GET A CHANCE I WILL TYPE OUT PART 2 OF
THIS DOC.IN THE MEANTIME KEEP AN EYE OPEN FOR MY "END OF GAME"
SAVED GAME DISK- WHICH CONTAINS A FILE ,WHICH ONCE LOADED,WILL
ALLOW YOU TO VIEW THE STUNNING??? END OF GAME SEQUENCE .
