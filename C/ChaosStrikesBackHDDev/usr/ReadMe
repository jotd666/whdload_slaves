 This install applies to "Chaos Strikes Back" © 1989 FTL.

 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick345.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.1 (16.05.05)
 - adapted for WHDLoad v16 (may solve some "Privilege Violation" problems)
 - "disk.3" image packed with XPK GZIP compressor

 version 1.0 (04.06.03) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - three language version supported
 - full usage of fast memory and caches (tested on 68060/50 with 64MB RAM)
 - utility disk supported (set CUSTOM2=1 to boot on custom disk)
 - disk protection removed (thanks Harry for the patch)
 - saves to HD (on file "disk.3", number can be changed with CUSTOM1 tooltype)
 - save/load independent of the selected language or utility disk
   (DM and CSB saves supported)
 - import of Dungeon Master and Chaos Strikes Back save game disks
 - quit to WB on "save and quit" option
 - many additional docs included
 - source code included (note the binary file which is part of Harry's code, can
   be resourced, but since it relies on exact offsets I did not include it as resourced
   in the source file)

 Important Notes:

 - select active game disk using CUSTOM1=# of disk image (start from 3)
 - boot on custom disk using the "UtilityDisk" icon (the one with CUSTOM2 set)
 - re-run the install script to import your savegames, caution: CSB games are imported
   as 'disk.3', DM games are imported as 'disk.4'. Rename previous savegames if needed.
 - you can also use DIC to import your savegames. First DIC the savegame disks, then
   rename them as 'disk.3', 'disk.4', etc... and select them using CUSTOM1 tooltype
 - some "insert original disk" requester may appear after some time (but can be safely ignored).
   Please send me a savegame disk where you're not attacked, and which produces the "insert disk" 
   request after a while without doing anything (I don't want to have to play much :))
