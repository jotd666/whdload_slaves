 About the trainer :

 When you skip levels using <HELP> key, until the world's boss, kill him !
 or music will be wrong for next levels.

 About the game :

 In the one-player-match, the second player is your enemy.
 Remove your mouse from joy-port1 or the program gets confused (unless CUSTOM1 is set)
