 NOTES
 ----

 If you have JST or old WHDLoad version of Chaos Engine AGA already installed, you can use
 same diskimages for this version, just join chaos.boot with chaos.disk1 to "disk.1"
 and rename chaos.disk2 to "disk.2"

 Enjoy this great game on your HD.

 I (JOTD) think that now CD남 version is the best one, except that it lacks
 Richard Joseph intro music :)

 I (JOTD) also think that MiCK wrote the WHDLoad version using big parts of my
 JST source without crediting me. Pretty unfair.

 CD남 version requires an installed A1200 or A4000 kickstart image

 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

Controls:

 CD남 joypad buttons & emulation keys:

 Player 1
 - P or play: pause
 - red: fire
 - space or blue: special weapon
 - L-shift or green: select special (current player/player 1)
 - R-shift or yellow: select special (cpu)
 - both shifts or green+yellow: swap special weapon
 - [When paused] SPC+both ALTs (blue+yellow+green): quit

 Player 2: keys 567890

 (original version switched to keyboard when joypad wasn't available,
  but my lowlevel implementation forces joypads, so it uses my internal
  emulation. Amounts to the same thing)
  
 ECS/AGA Floppy joypad buttons:
 
 - P or play: pause
 - red: fire
 - long red press: special weapon
 - space or blue: swap weapon
 - L-shift or green: select special (current player/player 1)
 - R-shift or yellow: select special (cpu)
 - player 1 both shoulders + yellow: quit current game
 - player 1 both shoulders + green: quit to workbench (only during game)

Note that the infinite specials option doesn't work first time it's used. I'm
not going to fix that. Just do it again...
