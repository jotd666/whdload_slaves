 REQUIREMENTS:
 - Slave requires WHDLoad V16+ and an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image
 - Game requires 512k chip mem and 512k other mem (+1.1Mb other memory for
   preload option)
 
 History:
 
 Version 1.1 (20.04.2021) done by JOTD:
 - reassembled with new kickemu, fixes 68000/68010 crash (issue #0005137)
 - uses fastmem and only 512kb chipmem
 - readme reworked
 - source code included

 Version 1.0 (21.12.2003) done by Codetapper:
 - Full load from HD
 - Copy protection removed (Herndon HLS Duplication/encryption/disk check x2)
 - Loads and saves best scores
 - 2 versions supported (original and quartex crack)
 - Manual included
 - RomIcon, NewIcon and OS3.5 Colour Icons (created by me!) and 2 Exoticons
   (taken from http://exotica.fix.no)
 - Quit option (default key is 'F10')
 
 Yet another Herndon protected game bites the dust!  Ben Herndon must have
 had a few complaints from people about his copy protection failing on newer
 Amigas and so adjusted it slightly.  Between the loops of self modifying
 code he setup an $800 byte area of nop's which was called to try and knock
 out the prefetch and cache problems.  I imagine that it still would have
 failed on 040/060 Amigas due to the large cache size but it should now work
 on all Amigas!  To try and be clever he also encrypted the game twice
 instead of the usual once!
 
 There are a couple of graphical glitches in the game - the surfer has a
 missing line down the middle when facing left and the woman that catches
 the frisbee in the flying disk event is not correctly drawn all the time.
 You will just have to live with these problems! I believe they are related
 to changes in sprites on AGA machines.
 
 You must have a registered version of WHDLoad to play this game!
 
 If you have an unmodified version of this game with a blank high score
 table please contact me as I would like to include clean scores in the
 install!
 
 Thanks to Angus for the original, Captain^HIT and Angus for testing, Wepl
 for the superb Kickstart 1.3 interface, all Action members and the WHDLoad
 team!  Happy new year everyone!
