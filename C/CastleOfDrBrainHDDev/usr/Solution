                      1> The Castle Door, Elevator Maze 
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
      Problem: 
      How do I open the castle door? 
 
      Hint: 
      When  you press  the doorbell,  notice which  stone flashes  and 
      plays  a tone.  Click the  hand cursor  on that  stone. Now  two 
      stones will flash and play tones. Click the hand cursor on these 
      stones in  the same order  they flashed. Now,  three stones will 
      play, etc. Try it, it's fun! 
 
 
      Problem: 
      Help! I'm lost in the mazes of the Stone Elevator! 
 
      Hint: 
      A really fun way to get  through these mazes is to just explore. 
      Try punching  through as many  walls as you  can! Each maze  has 
      four levels to it. You start at  the bottom and work your way up 
      to the top. Sometimes you have to go up and then back down again 
      to get through. If you get  really stuck, you may wish to sketch 
      out each  level to help you  keep track of paths  you've already 
      explored.

      equals ten,  forty-two times two  equals eighty-four, and  sixty 
      divided by twenty equals three. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      The Math Marvel Puzzle Room has me stumped - Standard. 
 
      Hint: 
      Twelve plus  twenty-three equals thirty-five,  ninety-nine minus 
      thirty-three  equals  sixty-six,  twenty-two  times  four equals 
      eighty-eight, and fifty-six divided by eight equals seven.

      row are two,  nine, and four. The numbers in  the middle row are 
      seven, five, and three. Finally, the numbers in the last row are 
      six, one, and eight. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      Magic Square Puzzle solution - Standard. 
 
      Hint: 
      Arrange the numbers  from left to right. The  numbers in the top 
      row are  sixteen, two, three,  and thirteen. The  numbers in the 
      second row are five, eleven, ten,  and eight. The numbers in the

      Problem: 
      15-Sliding Tile Puzzle solution - Novice. 
 
      Hint: 
      Start  with the  top row  and  work  your way  down. One  useful 
      technique is to snake tiles into position. Let's say you want to 
      place  the first  two numbered  tiles. First,  move the one tile 
      just under  the two position, and  the two tile right  under it. 
      Then move  other tiles so  that the empty  square is in  the two 
      position  and  slide  both  tiles  up.  Finally,  empty  the one 
      position square, slide the one tile  over, then the two tile up. 
      Work your way down the puzzle this way. 
 
      Problem: 
      15-Sliding Tile Puzzle solution - Standard and Expert. 
 
      Hint: 
      For starters,  begin with the  Novice solution. On  the Standard 
      and  Expert  Level  puzzles,  the  last  two  rows  are a little 
      trickier.  Think of  those squares  as points  around a  circle. 
      Let's say  you have most of  the third row, but  the ten tile is 
      out of order, like so -- nine, eleven, ten, and twelve. Move the 
      bottom row pieces  until the empty square is  underneath the ten 
      tile.  Then  slide  the  ten  tile  down  and  rotate  both rows 
      together, clearing the square between the nine and eleven tiles, 
      with  the  ten  tile  underneath  it.  Slide  the  ten tile into 
      position  and rotate  the pieces  back into  their correct rows. 
      When you complete the Expert Level puzzle, you'll form a picture 
      of Dr. Brain's Castle. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      I've run out of time in the Clock Room! 
 
      Hint: 
      Did  you  notice  the  remote-control  panel  beside Dr. Brain's 
      favorite cuckoo clock? Press the top  button to make the toy Elf 
      start dancing. Press the second button  from the top to turn the 
      clock off and the alarm on.  Press the third button from the top 
      to  start the  clock once  again and  put away  the cuckoo bird. 
      Finally, press the second button from the top to stop the clock, 
      followed by  the bottom button to  turn off the alarm,  and then 
      the top button to stop the  Elf from dancing. You'll have plenty 
      of time now.

      immediately flip the 15-second  hourglass. Click the open button 
      and the drawer will open. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      Acme Time Clock sand measurement - Standard and Expert. 
 
      Hint: 
      Flip the 15-second hourglass three times. Flip it the first time 
      after the  sand runs out of  it. Flip it a  second time when the 
      sand runs out  of it again. Finally, flip it  once more when the 
      35-second  hourglass runs  out. Click  the open  button and  the 
      drawer will open. 
 
 
      Problem:

      Problem: 
      I can't fix the circuit in the computer room! 
 
      Hint: 
      Starting from the lower left-hand side, place the battery in the 
      first position, the switch in  the second position, the resistor 
      in  the third  position, the  coil in  the fourth  position, and 
      finally the capacitor in the fifth position. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      How do I use the binary conversion computer? 
 
      Hint: 
      One fun  strategy is to just  twiddle each of the  zeros to ones 
      until you get  the light on right-hand side of  each row to turn 
      on. If  you examine each position  in a row from  right to left, 
      you'll notice the numbers increase by a power of two. This means 
      when  you change  a zero  to one  in the  right-most column it's 
      worth one, then increases to two  in the next column, then four, 
      then eight, then sixteen, then thirty- two, then sixty-four, and 
      finally  one-hundred and  twenty-eight in  the left-most column. 
      The total to the far left is simply a sum of these values. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      How can I get through the robot maze? 
 
      Hint: 
      To get through  this maze, you'll need to go  all the way around 
      the outer  edges of the  maze, moving from  left to right.  If a 
      swirling circle sends you back to the start of the maze, turn it 
      off by first  running the robot over a plus  symbol. As you move 
      the robot  around the maze  gather as many  answer cards as  you 
      can. 
 
 
      Problem:

      Hint: 
      You may wish  to use Iron face since it's  the honest robot head 
      and  will  follow  your  program  exactly.  If  you  choose  the 
      dishonest  Saucer head,  it will  disobey your  program exactly.

      I need a clue to solve the Jigsaw Puzzle! 
 
      Hint: 
      One way to  solve jigsaw puzzles is to look  for edge and corner 
      pieces  first. If  a puzzle  piece has  a flat  edge on the top, 
      left, or  right side, place  it along the  edges of the  screen. 
      Then you can also look for  like colors or patterns and assemble 
      these pieces right in the middle  of the screen, then place them 
      into their  final position. If  your screen gets  too cluttered, 
      you can always place pieces back into the box.

      How do I open Dr. Brain's Safe? 
 
      Hint: 
      You can solve this puzzle by  a process of elimination and trial 
      and error.  On the first  line, start by  guessing all the  same 
      symbols, for instance, all hearts. If  you get one right, on the 
      next line guess one heart and two of another symbol, such as two 
      oranges. If you get two right, then guess one heart, one orange, 
      and one of the remaining symbols. Now just keep working with the 
      symbols until they all fall in place.
