 version 2.4 (10.06.2019):
 - fixed some parasite file dump that I had added for reverse-engineering purposes
   and which made the game crash after a while (issue #0004132)
   
 version 2.3 (20.01.2019):
 - adapted to WHDLoad 17. Game levels & trainer can be selected from splash screen
 
 version 2.2 (20.12.2003) done by JOTD:
 - Three versions supported: V0.01 and V1.03 with and without disk protection.
 - Copy protection removed on the protected versions
 - Stackframe error (due to copyprotection) removed on both protected versions
 - Access faults fixed
 - Load/Saves from/to HD or floppy (saves are compatible with all the versions)
 - Tool to rip the saves from floppies (V1.03/unprotected saves only).
 - Complete walkthrough provided for both level disks, with some small additions
   from me (the walkthoughs are better than the ones provided on the official site
   or on the excellent www.gods-country.de site)
 - Documentation provided
 - Set CUSTOM2=1 to activate The Payoff level disk (or rename disk.3 as disk.2 !)
 - Set CUSTOM4=1 to enable free save games (you don't have to pay anymore to save!)
 - Set CUSTOM5=1 to activate in-game cheat keys (F3: infinite energy, F4: normal)
 - Source code included (Codetapper will love it :))
 - Savegames for payoff levels 2,3 & 4 included
 - Added glowicon by CFou!
 - Fully tested on Cadaver & Payoff levels
 - Savegames for each start of level included for original & payoff levels
 
 version 2.1 (2003)
 - added built-in trainer, infinite energy, that you can toggle on and off
   using F3 & F4. Set CUSTOM5=1 to activate it

 version 2.0 (2002)
 - uses WHDLoad and supports 3 versions.
 - It also fixes access faults which do not occur in english language,
   but in the french language (I don't recommend french language, 
   because there is a typo at level 2 on an orb name, and you don't know
   which is which... Also because I fixed the access fault, but I could not fix
   it completely: instead of crashing, some potion names will be garbage in the object
   display menu (but it still works in the individual object description)
 
 Version 1.x (1996-2001)
 - JST & pre-JST releases

Game versions:

There are 3 versions I know of:

 - v0.01: Imageworks release. Buggy, copy-protected, uses MFM savegame disk.
 - v1.03: Renegade/Bitmap bros release. Buggy, copy-protected, uses MFM savegame disk.
 - v1.03: Renegade/Bitmap bros release. Not copy-protected, not buggy, uses DOS tracks
   for savegames (much better). The tool provided to rip the saves from floppy disk
   only works for this version.
