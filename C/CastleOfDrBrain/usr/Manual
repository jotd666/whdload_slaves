                        THE CASTLE OF DR. BRAIN
                An Adventure Game to Strain Your Brain

HELP WANTED -- LAB ASSISTANT

Dr. Brain, world-famous mad scientist (well, I'm not really mad, just a
little bothered by the world situation), is currently interviewing 
candidates for the position of Laboratory Assistant.  The applicant 
chosen will help me save the world, create amazing new inventions
and clean up my secret basement lab.

Apply in person at The Castle of Dr. Brain.

THE CASTLE OF DR. BRAIN

Welcome to the Castle of Dr. Brain!  Dr. Brain is advertising for a lab
assistant and you just may be the one for the job.  Bring your copy of
the job ad and your best problem-solving skills, and be ready to test
your brain power.

In Dr. Brain's castle, you'll need to apply a lot of different ways of
thinking to solve the puzzles Dr. Brain has set up to test job applicants.
Some of the puzzles require planning ahead, others require the ability to
recognize patterns, still others depend on using logic, and all of them
take persistance.  If you don't solve a puzzle the first time through,
keep trying.

Hint Coins

You will begin the game with one hint coin, and earn more as you solve
the puzzles.  If you get stuck trying to solve a puzzle, click on the coin
slot in the puzzle window to buy help.

In some puzzles a hint coin will buy a solution to part of the puzzle.  If
a coin buys a solution, spending more coins (if you have them) will buy
more solutions.

In other puzzles a hint coin will buy a hint about solving the puzzle.
If a coin buys a hint, you can click on the coin slot to see the hint
again without spending more hint coins.

The more hint coins you have left over at the end of the game, the higher
your score will be.  Use your hint coins wisely.

Difficulty Level

You can set the difficulty level in Dr. Brain to Novice, Standard, or
Expert at any time.  The harder you set the difficulty, the more points
you will earn for solving the puzzles.

The Puzzle Interface

Each puzzle comes up onscreen in a puzzle box.  Each puzzle box has three
buttons:

Coin Slot:  Clicking on the coin slot button gets you help with the puzzle
if you have a hint coin to buy that help.  For more information on hint
coins, see Hint Coins, above.

Exit: Clicking on the Exit button closes the puzzle window.  If you are
unable to complete the puzzle or want to quit the game or do something
else in Dr. Brain's castle, clicking on Exit will allow you to leave the 
puzzle and come back to it later.

Question Mark: Clicking on the question mark tells you about the puzzle -
what you need to do, how to use the controls, and what kind of help your
hint coins will buy.

The Dr. Brain Icon Bar

At the top of the game screen is an icon bar.  Each icon represents an
activity you can perform in the game.  The icons in Dr. Brain are:

Look: looks like an eye.  Choose Look when you want a description of
something you see on the screen.

Do: looks like a hand.  Choose Do when you want to take an action on
something on the screen.

Item: looks like a picture frame.  If you are not using an item from your
inventory, the screen will be blank.  If you are using an item, that item
will be shown in the frame.

Inventory: looks like a book bag.  Choose Inventory when you want to see
what items you have picked up, or to use one of your items.  For more
information on Inventory, see your Sierra Game Manual.

Controls: looks like a slider bar on a control panel.  Choose Controls
when you want to change the volume or difficulty level of the game, or
when you want to save, restore, restart or quit your game.

Go Back: looks like an arrow pointing back the way you came.  Choose Go
Back when you want to leave the puzzle or room you are in now and go back
to the room you came from.

Help: looks like a question mark.  When you choose Help you will be able
to get information by moving the question mark cursor on the other icons
in the icon bar.  
 
Dr. Brain: click Dr. Brain to get a description of the room you are in.

For more information on how Icons work, see your Sierra Game Manual.

When you choose an icon, the cursor changes to reflect that item.  Use
the cursor on the screen to perform an action.  For instance, use the eye
cursor on an object to look at that object.  Use the hand cursor on an 
object to take an action on it, such as opening a drawer or picking 
something up.

Dr. Brain Says: Amaze your friends by writing secret messages using my
ultra top secret Decoder Grid!  Any time you want to write something
about a game or sport, just look it up on the grid.  Instead of using 
the name of the game, use its top secret symbol equivalent.  I guarantee
your friends will have absolutely no idea what you're talking about!

                              GAME MANUAL

HOW TO READ THIS MANUAL

Throughout this manual we will use the following ways of representing
information:

Menu Commands will be CAPITALIZED.  Example: SAVE, RESTORE, QUIT, PLAY

Type commands will appear as bold type.
   Example: 'type cd\sierra`

Portions of the command line not meant to be typed will not appear
in bold type.  For example, in the line 'type cd \sierra`, 'type`
should not be typed.

[Keystrokes] will appear in brackets setting them off from the
surrounding text.
   Example: [Spacebar], [Tab], [PageUp]
The brackets are not keystrokes and should not be typed.

Two or more keys that should be pressed together will be separated by
a hyphen (-).  This hyphen is not a keystroke, and should not be
typed.
   Example: 'Press [Ctrl-I] to view your inventory.`

If a space appears between parts of a command, it is meant to be typed.
   Example: 'type cd \sierra` (the space between cd and \sierra should be
   typed as part of the command)

The term 'diskette` is used to refer to either 3.5" or 5.25" data
storage disks.

game; if your computer system is running the game too slowly,
you may want to adjust the game detail to eliminate non-essential
animation.  Place the cursor on the lever and hold down the left mouse
button as you move the lever up (more detail) or down (less detail).

The TEXT lever, available only in selected games, adjusts the amount of
time text messages will remain on your screen.  Place the cursor on
the lever and hold down the left mouse button as you move the lever up
(less reading time) or down (more reading time).

   *Note: There may be a slight variation in the appearance of this icon

Pausing Your Game

If you wish to pause the game, select the System icon from the icon bar.  
The game will pause until you select PLAY to resume play.  Alternatively,
just bringing up the icon bar will also cause the game to pause.

Saving Your Game

IMPORTANT!! If you do not wish to save to your hard drive, you must have
a separate formatted diskette ready before you can save a game.  Since 
each disk can only hold a limited number of games, we recommend that you 
have more than one disk formatted, in order to assure adequate space for
save game storage.  To allow for errors in judgement and creative 
exploration, we recommend that you frequently save your game in progress, 
and that you save several different games from different points as you play.
You will always want to save your game before encountering potentially
dangerous situations.  You should also save your game after you have
made significant progress.  You may name your saved games using standard 
English phrases.  For example, if you are standing on a beach, you might 
call you game 'standing on beach`, or simply 'beach`.

Saving to a Floppy Disk

1. Choose the System icon (slide lever) from the icon bar, then select
   SAVE.  The Save Game menu will appear.
2. If you are playing from a hard drive and saving to a floppy drive,
   you will be prompted to insert your Save Game diskette into your 
   floppy drive (example: a:).
   PLEASE NOTE: The first time you attempt to save a game to a floppy
   disk while playing from the hard drive, you will need to change your
   default save game directory as follows: using your [Tab] key,
   select CHANGE DIRECTORY.
3. Press [Ctrl-C] to clear the command line, and type the name of your
   floppy drive.
4. Insert a blank formatted diskette in your floppy drive.
5. Select OK, and press [ENTER].
6. Type the description of your save game, and press [ENTER] to save
   the game.
* The term 'directory` refers to directories, drawers and folders.

Saving to Hard Disk

NOTE: If you choose to save games to your hard disk, we suggest that you
create one or more save game directories or folders on your hard disk.
See your computer's instructions for creating directories.

1. Choose the System icon (slide lever) from the icon bar, then select
   SAVE.  The Save Game menu will appear.
2. If you wish to save the game to a directory * other than the one you 
   are currently playing on, select CHANGE DIRECTORY *.  Press [Ctrl-C]
   to clear the command line, and type the drive and name of the new
   directory * .
3. Select OK, and press [ENTER].
4. Type the description of your saved game, and press [ENTER] to save the
   game. 

Restoring Your Game

1. Choose the System icon (slide lever) from the icon bar, then select
   RESTORE.  You will be prompted to select the game you wish to
   restore.
2. Highlight the desired game and select RESTORE.
3. If the game you wish to restore is in a different directory, select
   CHANGE DIRECTORY, then type the name of the directory * you wish to
   restore from.

* The term 'directory` refers to directories, drawers and folders.

Quitting Your Game

To stop playing, choose the System icon from the icon bar (slide lever)
and select QUIT.

Restarting Your Game

To restart your game at any time during play, choose the System icon
(slide lever) from the icon bar and select RESTART.

Message Windows

Message windows will appear at various times during the game.  When
you have read the message, press [ENTER] to remove the window and
resume play.

NOTE: Some message windows are program controlled, and cannot be cleared
by pressing [ENTER].  These windows will clear automatically, 
dependent on your text speed setting (see TEXT LEVER, page 20).

TIPS FOR ADVENTURERS

LOOK everywhere.  Thoroughly explore your surroundings.  Open doors
and drawers.  Look closely at all objects you encounter or you may
miss important details.  EXPLORE each area of the game very carefully, 
and DRAW A MAP as you progress through the game.  Make a note of each 
area you visit, and include information about objects found there and 
dangerous areas nearby.  If you miss an area, you may miss an important 
clue!

GET objects you think you will need.  You can see an inventory of
items on hand by choosing the Inventory icon at any time.

USE the items you have picked up to solve problems in the game.  
Different approaches to a puzzle may bring about a different outcome.

BE CAREFUL, and remain alert at all times - disaster may strike in
the most unlikely of places!

SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN, especially when you are about to try something new
or potentially dangerous.  This way, if the worst should happen, you 
won't have to start all over again from the beginning.  Save games at 
different points, so you will always be able to return to a desired 
point in the game.  In effect, this will enable you to travel backward 
through time and do things differently if you wish.
