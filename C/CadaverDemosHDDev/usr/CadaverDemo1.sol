1.      Pull all four levers, pick up the diary and the book and then leave
        via  the pit.
2.      Pick up the green book and exit up-screen.
3.      Pull the lever six times.  Get the bowl, the rocks and the book and
        leave using the steps.
4.      Climb down the steps and search the right hand barrel.  Get the sack
        and then get the key (it's behind the barrel and the rocks).  Go back
        up the steps.
5.      Open the chest with the key.  Get the dagger and the scroll and then
        exit right.
6.      Avoid the jumping bloke and exit through the door.
7.      The door locks behind you.  Pick up the potion.  Drop rock and move
        it over one of the holes so that the hole can no longer be seen.  The
        pull the lever.  The rock should prevent one of the spikes from
        emerging.  Pick up the rock and use the Dispel Traps spell on the
        chest.  Open it and get the wand, book and potion.  Face the door and
        use the wand on it to unlock it.  Exit.
8.      Avoid the blokes again and go back through the door to the left.
9.      Climb the stairs again to exit up-screen.
10.     Use the wand on the locked door and then go through.
11.     Stand on the left-hand wooden platform and move to the front.  Hold
        a rock and then press fire to throw it at the left-hand lever.  As
        the platform starts to move, jump off back to the stone floor.  Now
        go to the right-hand platform and throw another rock at the other
        lever.  This time stay on the platform and when it has finished
        moving, exit down-screen.
12.     Steer clear of the altar for the time being.  Get the book and then
        pull the lever.  Now go up to the altar and pick up all the rocks
        that result.
        Get the potion and the brass pyramid.  Now drag the barrel in the
        left corner over to the other barrels in the top-right corner.  Jump
        on the barrel and push the other two until the one with the chest on
        top falls to the ground.  Now push the chest off and open it.  Get
        the orb and search barrel to get the sack of stones.  Leave the room.
13.     Go to the exit up-screen.
14.     Leave via the left door.  If you feel like making a bit of money you
        can open the chest and put the gems in the gold-gambler.  Otherwise
        exit down-screen.
15.     Get the potion and exit down screen.
16.     Pick up the coins and the glass orb.  On the floor is a tile with a
        circle in the centre on a cross.  Put the glass orb in the circle.
        Now get the potion and the brass pyramid.  use the giant Jump Potion
        to get on the wooden ledge.  On one side of the ledge are two blocks;
        go to this side.  Jump over the first and stand in front of the
        second.  Have a drink of the red Strength Potion and push the blocks
        onto the orb on the floor.  Now jump back over the first block and
        push this onto the second.
        You should now have two blocks on the floor, one on top of the
        other.  Drop all your books on them and a couple of rocks.  Drop
        down, get the key and unlock the chest.  Get the scroll, the key and
        the orb.  Now get back onto the ledge and hop onto the pile of
        books/rocks you have made.  Leave through the door.
17.     Go back the way you came to the unnamed with the keyhole.  Use the
        key and exit via the right door.
18.     First pull the lever.  Stand in front of the two spikes nearest the
        lever and hold a rock.  On the floor, in the moving block's path, is
        an almost blank paving stone.  You must wait until the block is
        moving up-screen and is about half-way across this tile.  Then press
        fire to throw the rock.  With a bit of luck it will land on the edge
        of the block and will knock the lever.  If it doesn't keep trying.
        Move over the now retracted spikes and get the book.  Before you
        leave up-screen, drop both scrolls, the sleep orb and the wand.
19.     If you dropped your magic (see above) it won't be destroyed.  get
        both silver orbs to kill the Watcher.  Leave via the steps.
20.     Quickly get the key and pull the lever.  Use the key in the keyhole
        and exit down-screen.
21.     Kill the jumping monsters with one of your weapons (it's not easy).
        Get the orb and leave through the right-hand door.
22.     Get everything, but don't open the casket yet.  Exit left.
23.     Exit left.
24.     Pick up all your magic, drop the casket and use the Dispel Traps
        scroll to dispel the trap.  Open the casket and get the orb.  Pull
        the left-hand lever and exit up-screen.
25.     Use the Unlock Door spell on the locked door and go through.
26.     Watch where the floating grey platform lands and stand near it.  You
        must drop one of the brass pyramids on it and then rush over to the
        lever.
        Pull it when the platform is over one of the posts and the pyramid
        should drop onto it.  Pull the lever again to bring back the platform
        and repeat this procedure for all three pyramids.  When you've done
        that, exit up-screen.
27.     Quickly grab the final pyramid and leave down-screen.  If you're
        fast then only one baddie will appear.
28.     Put the pyramid on the platform and drop it over the final post.  A
        tune will play if you've done it properly.  Exit up-screen.
29.     Because of the pyramids on the posts, no further baddies will
        arrive.  Put the orbs (NB - not the sleep spell orb - it won't work)
        in each hole to unlock the door.  Go through.
30.     All you have to do is go up the stairs and that, to coin a phrase,
        is it.

NOTE:
This will not give a 100% score.  However, extra points can be gained by
dropping down the pit in the Holy Hall.  Push a barrel to the edge of the
crevice and use it to jump the gap.  Repeat for the other chasm and pull
the lever.  You will reappear in the Ante-Chamber.

End.
