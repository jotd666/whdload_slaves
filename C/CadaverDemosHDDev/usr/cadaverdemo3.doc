Wulf castle stands alone in the miasmal swamps that surround it,once
the power power base of the Wulf dynasty it now lies deserted except
for one person,Dianos the necromancer.Many ledgends pervade the old
ruin,tales of fallen knights,an exiled brother and a trecherous
chancellor.Hired as a bounty hunter by the captains of the murdered
Lord Carolus your task is to enter the castle and destroy his assasin
the insane chancellor Dianos.Many rooms lie between you and the upper
chambers,where Dianos has taken up residence,and considering the
recent struggles that have taken place within there will be lethal
traps waiting.Monsters of many kinds have taken up residence with the
necromancer and others have been summoned from their etheral
planes,these minnions will certainly come to the aid of their
master.And so your small boat sets out across the marsh,heading for
the gatehouse,and beyond,the dark castle,waiting


                         PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS

Cadever is played using a joystick and occasional key presses.The game
is played through a series of rooms displayed in isometric
projection.There are three major modes of opperation:

1a. While playing the character is moved around using the joystick,the
fire button allows the player to jump.

1b. While holding a weapon the fire button fires the weapon as long as
it has ammunition.

1c. While holding a prepared spell the fire button casts the spell
until exhausted.

(note:the 'return' key toggles a held object on and off allowing the
player to jump without having to return a weapon or spell to the
rucksack.)

2.  On touching an object the lefthand status display shows a series
of icons,these represent the actions that can be executed upon that
item,for example searching it or picking it up.These icons change for
different items.The joystick cycles through the avaliable icons and
the fire button activates them.

3a. On pressing the spacebar,a large window on the right of the status
display shows the first item in your rucksack,moving the joystick up
or down cycles through the avaliable items.Moving left or right cycles
through the icons for the item displayed.

3b. Pressing the spacebar again allows access to the overview of the
rucksack,this shows 16 items from the rucksack,these can be scolled by
moving the joystick.Pressing fire selects the item and returns you to
the'small' rucksack display in order for you to select the appropriate
action.

are clearly labeled,experimenting will often reveal their function or
name.

used so far,the joystick scrolls the map and the up and down arrow
keys zoom in and out,pressing fire returns the game to play.The room
you are currently in is hi-lighted.


                         GENERAL INFORMATION

The small level on this playable demo of Cadaver was specially created
for this cover disk,it is not a part of the finished game as we felt
that revealing any of the challanges before the release of the product
would mar future players enjoyment.The action is set within the
gatehouse as a prelude to the castle itself.Players will find a
selection of puzzles,spells,potions and one monster type in order to
practice those skills neccesary for playing the full game.Not all
items that are found littering the building will be of use but most
are worth investigating,also it is not neccesary to solve all the
puzzles to complete the game but many will provide bonuses of gold or
experiance.
