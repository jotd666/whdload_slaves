   This install applies to Cadaver demo - 3 unique bonus levels, ©1990 Bitmap Brothers


   That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path.
   Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.

   You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
   You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
   Tooltype "QuitKey=").


   if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
   a newer version of this install from 
      http://www.whdload.de
   if that doesn't help try some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC,
   NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. if that also doesn't help inform the
   author via the Bug-Report-Form
   
   for full WHDLoad package and other installs refer to:

History:

 version 1.1 (13.07.2019)
 - adapted to whdload v17 (issue #0004146)
 - changed CUSTOM tooltypes
 
 version 1.0 (2002) done by JOTD
 - first release
 
The first demo was originally uploaded by Bill Bennett (bspwrb(at)bath.ac.uk),
a Cadaver maniac (like me).
The second demo level has been provided by Keith Krellwitz.

Second demo level is actually the one pointed by CUSTOM2=0. It was released for 
a demo in a magazine. Walkthrough for that one is included too.
I'm looking for a walkthrough for the other one (I nearly completed it, but did
not reach the end).

I hacked the files a bit so they decrunch faster, without stripes and allow to quit
by pressing the QUITKEY key. I also added a trainer option (CUSTOM1=1 tooltype) which allows
infinite energy (easier to end the game)

It completes my quest for patching the Cadaver series to HD.


The third demo level was sent by Tomaz Kac, and was featured in Amiga Format #13
(set CUSTOM1=2 to enable it)

I was not aware of this demo until Tomaz sends it to me. The controls are a bit
different, and the interrupt system of this one was very buggy (keyboard/VBL).
I had to fix it a little bit and it seems to have no sound. Original instructions
(with wierd control description) are included. This must be the very first
demo level since there is no sound at all and other demo level controls
are the same as the final version. It's also the easiest one.


To do: Try to do some kind of save game (it won't be a piece of cake :))
Better run it on UAE with save state function :)

I enclose Bill instructions below

--

Long: This is an old coverdisk demo containing 1 full bonus level of 
Cadaver, which is not to be found as part of either Cadaver or The Payoff.  

For those not familiar with Cadaver, it's a 3D isometric adventure/arcade
game, in which you move Karadoc the dwarf through a series of rooms,
acquire items, spells, etc. and solve (fiendish) puzzles. 

Controls:  Use the joystick to move Karadoc around, jump and interact with
objects.  When holding a weapon or spell, the fire button activates it,
other items will be thrown.  "H" key will toggle a held item on or off. F3
toggles between icons being displayed as soon as you touch an item, or
after pressing fire.  F2 toggles between using fire and enter to bring up
icons.  Space brings up the last item you used, and Return will bring up
the entire rucksack.  The diary in the first room lists your health, gold
(irrelevant in this demo) and XP, as well as the percentage of rooms
visited.  F1 brings up the map, the joystick scrolls it, Del centres it on
you, and cursor up/down will zoom.  P pauses, C clears all messages from
the screen, and F4 toggles between movement in 4 and 8 directions. 

Now for a plea - I can't solve the damn thing - if anyone manages to 
complete the level, could they please email me?  

Ta,
