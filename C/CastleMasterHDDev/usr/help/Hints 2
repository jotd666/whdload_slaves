Once you have started up the game press [SHIFT], [L] and [RIGHT MOUSE]

coloured boxes. Shoot them for infinite lives, all ten keys, the ending,
rock travel.


Castle Master · General Playing Tips
************************************
The key on the chapel roof can be a swine to get hold of if you don't
know how to get up there. All you have to do is stand on the drawbridge
and close it. You will then be lifted up, making it a doddle to get
hold of the prize.

When trying to collect the pentacles in the caverns, fall down one of
the trap doors and kill the spirit. Collect the first pentacle then go
to the other caverns collecting the pentacles and killing the spirits.
This will make the going easier if you fall into a cavern, since you're
saved the hassle of tackling a spirit that catches you unawares.

To get inside the display chamber, crawl inside the granary chest and
close the lid. Access is then as easy as falling off a rather wobbly
chair perched precariously perched on the top of a table.

Collecting the pentacle in the junk room isn't as obvious as it seems.
When you enter the room, crouch down, walk over the first shelf and into
the wall and stand up. Now do a U-turn and walk forward to collect the
item.

To move the big rock or open the pottery door, you need to have maximum
strength. If you haven't then fiund some food to top up your energy then
try again.

If you have the rock travel potion, you can get to the gymnasium either
from the Wizard's hut or from directly outside. If you're having trouble
finding the spirit in the dungeon, then try looking for something else
rather than the obvious. Still stuck?  Well try that rat-like animal at
the back of the room...

Now for the big baddy himself. To kill Magister, the evil owner of the
castle, wipe out all the other spirits first. Now go to his room and
blast him in the forehead to destroy him.

Notes and Hints
***************
* There are 26 spirits including the dragon. These must be destroyed
  before the Magister (the 27th) can be killed.
* Maximum health is 12 weights (6 on each side) = Herculean
* To get onto chapel roof, stand on the drawbridge then close it.

Note: Don't do this until you have the key from the wizard's hut and have
      entered the catacombs from under the large rock, and then under the
      rug in the wizard's hut.

* Lifting weights in the gymnasium increases your health.
* Standing in hospital cures you up to normal health.
* The spirit in the courtyard will only appear when a rock is thrown at
  the flag.
* To enter the junk room, fire at the plate (on the left of the door),
  until it disappears, enabling the door to be opened.
* To kill the dragon, shoot eyes, teeth and horns, until they disappear.
* To kill the Magister, shoot at his head (not eyes).
* To confront the dragon, start on level 4 in the SW tower. Enter onto
  the ballroom balcony, there is a break next to the last door, drop
  down, and commence along the south passage.
* To find the Magister, go to the SE tower and press the button in the
  king's solar on level 4. Then reach across the second barrier in the
  corridor, and activate the crank. Go round to the south passage (the
  long way) and you will be able to enter the Magister's room.
* A final piece of treasure appears on the table in the wizard's hut
  after the key has been collected from the chapel roof. Use rock travel
  to transport yourself from window in the gymnasium to the wizard's hut,
  then collect treasure and transport back.
