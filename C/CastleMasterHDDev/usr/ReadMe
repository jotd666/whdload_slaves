 This install applies to "Castle Master" © 1990 Incentive Software/Domark.

 Original release, a rerelease, the Virtual Reality 1 rerelease and 
 another rerelease on Amiga Games Compilation #1 are supported.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 For the Amiga Games Compilation #1 you need additionally xfddecrunch in
 the path (from aminet:util/pack/xfdmaster.lha).

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

History:

 - fixed support for SPS447 (didn't work at all, issue #0005092)
 - better support for SPS612: Castle Master 2 / The Crypt is selectable
   (you'll have to reinstall the game to enable it)
 - optional skip intro & select character from whdload splash screen
 - using fast memory for better speed (issue #0002818)
 - added adjustable speed regulation for ... slower speed :)
 - converted to kickemu
 - quitkey on 68000 (issue #0003640)
 - added proper delay after save/load
 - fixed install script for varying label disk

 
 Version 1.20.1 - 2011-oct-16 icons added and install script changed
			     (Irek/Wepl)
 Version 1.20 - 2011-sep-25 Another rerelease adapted, map for cellar
                             added. (Harry)
 Version 1.12 - 2011-sep-04 icons and docs added, new install script,
			     files moved to a data directory,
			     thanks to Irek Kloska for icons (Wepl)
 Version 1.11 - 2011-aug-28 Another rerelease adapted. (Harry)
 Version 1.10 - 2001-jan-27 Rerelease adapted. (Harry)
 Version 1.00 - 1998-oct-26 Initial release. (Harry)

The install is tested with on a 2 MB A1200, on an 18 MB 68030 and on E-UAE.

Disclaimer: Although i try to make my installs as reliable as possible, you 
          use them wholly on your own risk.

Notes: Select your language with CUSTOM1 (1-deutsch, 2-english, 
          3-français), since im not going to implement screen- and 
          windowmanagement in the OSEmu for a cli-selections-menu.
          However i cant recommend to play the german version in the 
          original release since it has some serious translation errors 
          (In the rerelease the translation has been corrected). Please
          note that only the english language is supported in the
          Virtual Reality rerelease.

Cheatmode: Start the game, hold left shift+L and press the right mouse 
          button about 25 times. 4 boxes should appear: Unlimited lives, 
          10 keys, end sequence or rock travel.
		  
Have fun, Harry and Wepl.

Notes from JOTD:

- the slave needed refreshing, some versions support were broken, and it didn't
  allow to run Castle Master 2 from SPS612 (needs reinstalling)
- another 3D game that didn't use fastmem for absolutely no reason.
  After relocating the music in chipmem, everything runs file. 
  Should be faster now.
