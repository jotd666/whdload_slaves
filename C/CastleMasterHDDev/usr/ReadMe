That patch applies to Castle Master (c) 1990 Incentive Software/Domark.
Original release, a rerelease, the Virtual Reality 1 rerelease and 
another rerelease on Amiga Games Compilation #1 are supported.

This install has the slave-version 1.20.
It needs WHDLoad 10 or higher in the path (eg in c:). For the Amiga
Games Compilation #1 you need additionally xfddecrunch in the path
(from aminet:util/pack/xfdmaster.lha).

Fixed:  Sound replay.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Notes:	That install features the partial-os-emulation by the WEPL/
          Mr.Larmer/me. Due the big files the install is this time even 
          useable with few ram.
        Select your language with CUSTOM1 (1-deutsch, 2-english, 
          3-français), since im not going to implement screen- and 
          windowmanagement in the OSEmu for a cli-selections-menu.
          However i cant recommend to play the german version in the 
          original release since it has some serious translation errors 
          (In the rerelease the translation has been corrected). Please
          note that only the english language is supported in the
          Virtual Reality rerelease.
        I recommend playing the game without caches, since its a bit
          too fast with (but runs).

Cheatmode: Start the game, hold left shift+L and press the right mouse 
          button about 25 times. 4 boxes should appear: Unlimited lives, 
          10 keys, end sequence or rock travel.

Solution: Maps and hints can be found in the install.

Have fun, Harry and Wepl.

Notes from JOTD:

- the slave needed refreshing, some versions support were broken, and it didn't
  allow to run Castle Master 2 from SPS612
- another 3D game that didn't use fastmem for absolutely no reason. Should be faster
- on WinUAE the game is super-fast, I may add speed regulation later.
