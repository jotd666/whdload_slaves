                        CASTLE MASTER HINTS

Typed by DDB.  Edited by PARASITE.


* To open the drawbridge : throw a stone at the hole next to the
bridge.

* Food (cheese , fish and sausages) are all over the place , buth
in the kitchen , there is a secret room behind the fireplace. You
can crawl through this gap and you'll find plenty of food.

* Next to the library is a secret room. To get there examine the
books on the middle shelf. A chair will appear, get on the chair
and wait.

* Also in the kitchen under the table is a clue : Full strenght
makes boulth but boulther makes way. This means : When at full
strenght you can push away the boulder at the start of the game.
Under the boulder is an entrance to the catacombs.

* The map of the cellar is very incomplete. This is because I
couldn't find any logic in the layout of the cellars and
catacombs. In the catacombs : If you see a green outlined door ,
then you've found the cellar steps to the NW tower. You can open
the door only from this side , not from the tower.

* Hoth Baths : Pull the switch to the left of the entrance and
the pool will empty. Now you can enter the caverns from the
bottom of the pool.

* Don't drink to much wine coz when your head hurts this will
cost energy.

* Don't eat green cheese.

* Don't go into the ladies toilet.

* To open the vault you have to collect all the pentacles that
are scattered all over the place. You can look into the vault
from the guard room.

* In Igors chambers you have to shoot Igor and open the chest.

* In the pottery you can drink something out of one of the pots.
I'm not sure what it does.

* When entering the Great hall from the second floor you have to
watch out not falling off the edge. In the corner is a gap in the
ledge, watch out !!

* Pressing green blocks often opens doors or slides away
obstacles.

* clue for level 4. On the map you see a diamond shaped symbol ,
this is also on the floor in the game. To open the barrier ahead
, stand on the diamond and press the four green blocks in quick
succesion.
