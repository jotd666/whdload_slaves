 Virtual Cockpit
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Unlike most simulators, the cockpit view is not a fixed view to the front
 of you. It is a 'real' three dimensional object, which enables you to look
 around in every direction. By pressing the right mouse button and moving
 the mouse, you can turn your 'head' around.
 It is possible to fly north and to turn your head from the West to the
 East. Or you can look up to watch a plane flying over. You can even look
 down and watch your own virtual hand moving the steering column. ( Set
 object detail to 10 in preferences menu <Del> )

 Artificial Intelligent Living World
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 In other games you are the only target of the enemy. In this game there
 exists a world living on his own. Enemy pilots choose their own targets
 and you are just one of them. You can watch planes killing tanks while
 flying past. There a lot of different vehicles and all of them have their
 own artificial intelligence.

 IHADSS Integrated helmet and display sighting system
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 You don't have to line up your chopper to the target, it's enough to
 turn your head. Thanks to the virtual cockpit this system is very well
 simulated !

 Extensive flight computer
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Including many functions like radar, sattelite view, extensive databank,
 virtual camera and real-time battle reports.

 Flexible Viewposition Control
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 By using your mouse you can rotate around and zoom in/out all vehicles.
 You can even fly along enemy military hardware to study their tactics.
 Supported views : Inside, Outside, Independent, Missile and Sattelite.

 Nice light effects
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Real shadows, shading, depth cueing and a gradient horizon

 Cyclic world map
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The world never ends, just like in real life, it's round!

 The possibility to make your own scenario
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This makes all kinds of what-if  scenario's possible. It's possible, for
 example, to launch 10 A10 warthogs against a single T72 tank.

 Four involved sides
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 East, West, UN and Civil.
 Which side is friendly and which is hostile depends fully on your own
 behaviour.

 Four surrounding types of area
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Forest, jungle, desert and ice

 Four times of days in which to start
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Dawn, afternoon, nightfall and night

 Smart weapon systems
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Hellfires   : laser guided missile,lock on your reflected laser
 Sidewinders : infra red guided missile,lock on heat radiated by vehicles

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coala works on a standard A1200 and the A4000

Although it will work on these platforms we suggest the use of
some FAST memory. This will make the animation frame rate twice as fast !
Coala detects and uses faster processors like the 68030 and 68040.
For optimum game satisfaction we also recommend the use of a harddisk with
2 Megabyte of free space.

To be short, the minimum requirement is a 68020 processor and an AGA
chipset. Everything above this minimum will be used by the game to
give you faster/better graphics.

If you are not sure about the system specifications of the computer
you use, please consult the manuals which came with your computer and
additional expansions.







-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I N S T A L L A T I O N
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coala can be installed on a harddisk.

Before you proceed, make a backup copy of the gamedisk and use this
disk to install the game instead of the original floppy disk.
This will prevent the original game disk from being damaged.
The backup copy and the original is for private use only!
If you're not sure of how to do this, please consult the manuals which
came with your computer.
Startup the workbench, insert the disk and doubleclick on the disk icon.
The look for the icon called 'HDinstall' and doubleclick on this icon.
After a while the program will ask you questions about the place
where to store the game, answer these questions.
After a short while  the game is installed on your harddisk and can
now be played from your harddisk.

If any of the above terms are unfamiliar, please consult the Workbench
manual for further explanation.







-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
L O A D I N G
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run Coala, simply Doubleclick on it's icon from the workbench or type
'Coala' from the shell in the appropiate directory.

After you've released a decoy, the missile aimed at you will continue flying
but won't be able to follow your path, so don't release a decoy and
keep flying straight ahead. The missile will follow the path of the decoy
and eventually wil hit you. The proper use of it is to release a decoy and
turn away, leaving your original flight path, while the missile will continue
flying after your decoy.

You can choose from four different weapons. When landing on a friendly base
you are automatically rearmed and refuelled.

-30 MM GUN	Bullets
		unguided, short range
		Thanks to the IHADSS system ( integrated helmet and display
		sighting system) the 30 mm gun slaves automatically whenever
		you move your head. So you don't have to line up your chopper
		to the target

-FFAR 		Unguided Rockets
		stabalized by rotating,long range.
		Because rockets are unguided, you have to line up your
		chopper to the target. Notice the movement of the crosshair
		when you move your head.

-HELLFIRE	Laser Guided Missiles
		Flies automatically to the vehicle/building your laser is
		pointing at. Since the missile flies to the reflecting point
		of your laser, you have to keep the laser pointing at the
		target UNTIL it hits the target. It's even possible to switch
		to a different target while the missile is flying.
		Long range

-SIDEWINDER	IR Guided Missiles
		Locks on the heat produced by the vehicle's engines.
		This is the only weapon that can be effectively used against
		fast moving objects like jet planes.
		Fire and Forget
		Long Range

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
G A M E   P L A Y
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this game you will find yourself in a fully armed helicopter in the middle
of a battlefield. You have no missions, no commanding officers and no orders.

The objective of this game is to find out what's happening in the battlefield
,choose one side and to help them win the battle. There are a lot of
scenarios to choose from. It's even possible to make your own scenario or to
let the computer make a random scenario.

Each scenario requires different tactics, for example it makes a big
difference if you have to fight against 3 tanks+1 chopper or 1 tank+ 3
choppers !

When you first enter the battlefield you have neither enemies nor friends.
The East and West side are at war and by attacking one of those sides you
got yourself involved in this battle.

Every vehicle in the field has his own artificial intelligence. You have to
find out different tactics for each type of vehicle. For example :

-Fighter planes won't be able to track you if you fly at a low attitude

-The best tactic to kill a chopper is the ambush, for example behind a
 big building.

-Always keep yourself covered by buildings or trees when approaching an
 AA-GUN.

-You can escape missiles by using decoys, or to dart off perpendicular
 to the missiles's flight path

-Use the right decoy (CHAFF/FLARE) for the right missile

Always remember that actions cause reactions. For example :

-Killing a Western plane not only pleases the Eastern forces but also
 gives you a new enemy !

-Attacking an UN vehicle gives you a very tough enemy : the rest of the
 world ! The UN will immediately send some F16 fighters after you !!!
 (if available)

-Killing a red-cross/ambulance vehicle will make the enemy furious

-You will only be rearmed and refueled at friendly bases

In the field you will encounter 4 sides :

        1 East		 	uses RUSSIAN equipment
        2 West		 	uses NATO equipment
        3 UN (United Nations)   attacking this side is not a very clever move
        4 Civil			don't find yourself brave by attacking this side

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 -     PEACE

Voted the most boring mission by anonymous descision.
This scenario is perfectly suitable for practicing at flying the chopper
and trying out 'new' techniques and strategies.

2 -     COLD WAR

There is no war, but the tension is there. Be carefull at what you do,
you might conflict a full scale war!

3 -     UN CONTROLLED CEASE FIRE

The eastern and western force agreed on a cease fire, which is controlled
by the United Nations. You can terminate this cease fire by attacking one
of the parties. Do not try out the patience of the UN by killing one
of their machines, unless you're sure you can dodge some jet planes!

4 -     TANK BATTLE

Although the war rages on, eastern and western forces have restricted themself
at 'only' using tanks. Find out why the coala helicopter is nicknamed
'tank killer' in this scenario.

5 -     GROUND WAR

After the use of tanks, AA'S are entering the battlefield as well as
other vehicles. Stay clear of those AA vehicles, you might end up with
a missile trying to get you.

6 -     HELICOPTER BATTLE

Fight head to head with other helicopters. Show them who really
controls the air!

7 -     AIR BATTLE

Both forces decided to let 'tank killers' and fighterplanes enter the
battlefield, this will require a new strategy when dealing with
the enemy.

8 -     TOTAL WAR

Every vehicle the Eastern and Western force could find is dragged into
the war to finish off the enemy forever. You can expect a attack from
everywhere, either ground or air!

9 -     RANDOM

Now for a real challenge, try this scenario!
You'll be the one to find out in what situation your landed and how
to deal with it.

10 -    CUSTOM SCENARIO

Create your own scenario, please read this manual of how to do this.





----------------------------------------------------------------------------
M A K E   C U S T O M   S C E N A R I O   M E N U
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This feature makes it possible for you to create your own scenario.
You can define up to 20 vehicles from all four sides involved.
You'll most likely to find this the most interesting option of the game,
because it allows you to experiment with all kinds of what-if scenario's.
If you want a real challenge always make Western forces equal to Eastern forces,
but it's more interesting to create unfair situations. For example :

- 10 warthogs against 10 Eastern trucks         (road to hell)
- 10 Migs against 1 Eagle                       (watch the crossfire)
- 10 ZOO's mobile anti aircraft guns
  against 1 Cobra helicopter                    (dangerous grounds)
- 10 tanks against 10 APC'S                    (tank's on holiday)

But don't make the mistake by making the force ratio too extreme : Some
vehicles might get killed by crossfire !

If you want to watch artificial intelligence in action press <F5> in the
games to cycle through all the vehicles.
