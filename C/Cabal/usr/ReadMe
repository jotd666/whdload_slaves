 This install applies to "Cabal" © 1989 Ocean.

 Requirements:
 -------------
 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed game requires 0.5 MB ChipMem (+0.9 MB OtherMem for preload).
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 Features:
 ---------
 - Full load from HD
 - Protection removed (Copylock)
 - OS stuff patched
 - Blitter waits added (x21)
 - DMA wait in replayer and sample player fixed (x6)
 - Byte write to volume register fixed (x6)
 - Interrupts fixed
 - Write to $dff0f8 disabled
 - Bplcon0 color bit fixes (x3)
 - CD32 joypad support added (CUSTOM3)
 - Trainer options added (CUSTOM1/2)
 - High-score saving added (disabled if any trainers are used)
 - Decruncher (ByteKiller) optimised and relocated
 - Source code included as usual
 - Quit option that works on 68000 machines (default key is 'F10')

 Here's yet another old patch redone completely. I actually only planned
 to add support for the second fire button (to throw grenades) but after
 some hours of work I decided to do everything from scratch as there were
 quite a few problems with the old patch (keyboard routines not fixed, no
 blitter waits added, missing/wrong DMA wait patches, high-scores saved
 to disk image etc. pp.).

 I have fixed all the mentioned problems (the blitter wait patches can
 be disabled with CUSTOM4) and added a few trainers as usual. If in-game
 keys are enabled the following extra keys can be used:

 L - toggle unlimited lives
 E - toggle unlimited energy
 B - toggle unlimited grenades
 I - toggle invulnerability
 G - get machine gun
 N - skip level

 If CD32 joypad support is enabled (CUSTOM2) you can press the follwing
 buttons:

 main menu:  red/fire 1: start single player game
            blue/fire 2: start two player game

 in-game:   blue/fire 2: throw grenade
 	           play: toggle pause

 Please note that it will not be possible to throw grenades with fire+down
 if joypad support is enabled as it is pretty annoying to throw grenades
 even without wanting that. Hence only fire 2 will be used for the grenades!

 If any trainer options are enabled the high-score saving will be disabled.

 Enjoy the game from HD.
