 This install applies to "Cruise For A Corpse / Croisière pour un cadavre" © 1991 Delphine

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

THANKS TO:

- Carlo Pirri for testing and destroying and scanning his codewheel for me :)
- Juergen for the original disk images
- Skid Row for their crack, which did not work at all with OSEmu, and I had to
  adapt it a lot.
- The Sparrows for their crack, which worked.
- Matthew Thompson for reporting the mouse problem with EZMouse PS/2 adapter
  (now it should be OK since I dumped OSEmu)

Notes:

- you'll have to reinstall the game to use 2.0 (or copy the "s" directory of disk 1 into "data")
- I removed my crack because it did not work on kickemu, only on OSEmu !
- There's still a sound issue at the beginning. Too bad :)
