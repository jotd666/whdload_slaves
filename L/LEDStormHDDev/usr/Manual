THE L.E.D. STORM STORY
It's the hottest road race of the future.  L.E.D. Storm puts you in control
of a high-powered, ramp-jumping super car that will take you through the
nastiest race course devised by man.  Your only weapons are speed, skill
and timing, as you launch yourself into the wildest encounter ever.

The nine sections of this course will take you over an entire continent. 
You'll begin at the Capitol City and make your way through the Netwood
Forest, the Coral Sea, the Ruins Desert, and five other disaster areas. 
Specialized traps and hazards threaten to stop you dead in your tracks all
along the way, so buckle up, and get ready for the ride of a life-time.

JOYSTICK OPERATION
L.E.D. Storm (both Amiga and Atari ST versions) require a joystick.  The
commands are simple, but true mastery of the game will take some practice. 
The joystick commands are:

* Push up to accelerate.
* Pull down to decelerate.
* Push right to move vehicle right.
* Push left to move vehicle left.
* Press the firing button to make your vehicle jump.

GAME PLAY
There are several ways to regain energy for your L.E.D. STORM vehicle.  You
need to closely monitor fuel consumption because the game will end if you
run out of fuel.

JERRY CANS - Driving over these objects causes individual letters of the
word "ENERGY" to illuminate (this is displayed on the right side of the
screen).  Once the final letter is illuminated, you'll receive a
substantial fuel bonus.

GROUND SYMBOLS - These are dropped by passing spaceships and it will aid
your journey if you can pick them up.  There are three different types: E
(for energy), B (for barrier), and P (for points).

ENERGY PODS - Jump to catch them as they float above you on parachutes.

HINTS FOR GAME PLAY

MANIC FROGS - These creatures grab hold of your car, slowing you down and
hampering your jumping ability.  Move your joystick rapidly from left to
right to shake them off.

COMPUTER CAR - This is your main adversary.  Avoid where possible, because
it will do its utmost to send you into oblivion.  To destroy the computer
car, jump in air and land on it.

TNT TRUCKS - Due to the nature of their payload, they are impervious to any
kind of collision, so avoid them at all costs.

CRATES AND OIL SLICKS - These appear from time to time strewn over the
road.  Avoid these as best you can, because crashing into them will spin
your car and slow you down, wasting valuable time.
