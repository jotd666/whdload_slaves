NOTES

This game really needed a HD install. I think it's unplayable from floppy.

There's an old tool that we didn't port which is called "ripsaves", which allows
to rip floppy savegames. It can be run either from WB or CLI. From CLI
it accepts an argument (0 to 3) for the floppy unit. (e.g: ripsaves 1 for DF1:)

Thanks to Walter Geriolz and Thomas Lorenz for sending me the disks (well, next time,
we'll coordinate better).
Thanks for the people who sent the other disk images.

Sorry for the delay but this one meant a lot of work for me. I hope you'll appreciate.

Supported versions:

english (SPS2030 and SPS2031)
italian (SPS2028)
french (SPS2040)
german


*PLEASE READ*

You have to first 'format' a disk to make saves work. This will create a
file called 'luresave.dir'. Then only you can save/load.
