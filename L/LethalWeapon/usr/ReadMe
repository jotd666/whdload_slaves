CHEAT MODE:
- Taken from Sweet Cheater by Keith Krellwitz!
- During play press and hold any of the following:

     'ALT', 'Y', ANY NUMBER (0-9)....................Skip levels.
     'ALT', 'Y', 'I'..................Turns off sprite collision.
     'ALT', 'Y', 'K'.........................Increase ammunition.
     'ALT', 'Y', 'L'..............................Increase lives.
     'ALT', 'Y', 'M'..........Removes game sprites and platforms.
     'ALT', 'Y', 'N'..........Replace game sprites and platforms.
     'ALT', 'Y', 'Q'...................................Game over.

  If you jump onto the notice board next to the mission 1 entrance and
  push up, you'll be able to collect 4 extra lives.

  On mission 3, jump along the 4th platform, jump up and keep pushing up
  and you'll climb the wall.  When you reach the top, walk to the left
  and keep going until you reach the edge of the screen.  There you will
  find 10 magnifying glasses, one gun, a round of bullets and an extra
  life.

                            (LEVEL CODES)

                     1-"KUIRFR"        3-"RDRKBA"
                     2-"BEIFCF"        4-"LYLSUA"


One version of this game has a main file incompatible with the internal
RNC decruncher in the most recent versions of WHDLoad. This has now been
fixed. The other access fault is a really nasty one which I have done my
best to bypass but if the game suddenly quits in debug mode, please
contact me and explain where exactly you were in the game when it
occurred.

Thanks to Keith Krellwitz for the original install, Bored Seal for the
bug report and to Steven Becker and Sun 68 for sending the originals!
