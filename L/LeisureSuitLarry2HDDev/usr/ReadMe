 This install applies to "Leisure Suit Larry 2" © 1990 Sierra.

 Working disk images are available on Back2Roots website

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.3 (30.01.2021) done by JOTD:
 - Now 1111 skips the protection but still shows the intro (issue #0004971)
 - 2222 skips the protection and the intro and jumps directly to the game
   (that should have been done in version 1.1 already but actually did not,
   and I really don't remember why, well, now that's fixed...)

 version 1.2 (26.06.2016) done by JOTD:
 - Fixed 68000/68010 compatibility (issue #0002896 of LSL3, also applies here)

  version 1.1-B (12/03/2016)
 - install script update (done by Josef Andersson)

 version 1.1 (29.08.03)
 - requires WHDLoad v16
 - adapted crack so 1111 code no longer bypasses the intro
   2222 code bypasses the intro instead
 - added nice Exoticon-style icon

 version 1.0 (01.08.03) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - fixed for fast memory (access fault in sound driver fixed)
 - manual protection bypassed (just enter 1111 at the telephone number check)
   (adapted from a crack by Quartex)
 - original quit option quits to WB
 - solution included
 - source code included

 Notes:
 - to reuse your old savegame disk, just copy it in the data/save directory
 - this game had 2 ways to bypass copy protection, and Quartex did not even see that,
   although the codes were present in memory without encryption, there were 2 codes
   matching no girl photograph in the end of the list. The first one is 0724 and is
   Al Lowe's birthday (according to his home page). It allows to play the game without
   entering the code, and without even seeing the intro (it was designed for testing purposes).
   The other code is 7915 and just skips the code section (but shows the intro,
   this is not mentionned on Al Lowe's homepage, so that's exclusive news, and it 
   should work on the PC version as well).
   By replacing all codes by 1111, Quartex messed the intro part. It was never shown
   in the cracked version. Now it is back thanks Seppo for telling me there was 
   actually an intro :)
