	LEISURE SUIT LARRY IN THE LAND OF THE LOUNGE LIZARDS

			3-D ANIMATED ADVENTURE GAME 
			REFERENCE CARD FOR AMIGA

Sierra's 3-D animated adventures represent a totally new approach to computer
gaming -- a third generation in computer adventure. They feature detailed three
dimensional background screens with life-like animated characters. The improved
parser lets you talk to the computer in whole sentence.

Sierra's new series of adventures are interactive, changing as you explore and
solve the puzzle. New facets are revealed as you delve into the game. In fact,
because of ramdom events, you can play the game many times over and never play
the same game twice.

BEFORE GETTING STARTED
Before starting to play you should make back-up copies of your original disks.

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
1.  Power up the system and load the Amiga Kickstart disk and the Amiga
Workbench disk.
2.  Use the preference tool from the Workbench disk to set date and time
information. This procedure is recommended but not required.
3.  Insert the original program disk or a back-up copy you have made, into the
drive and double click the left mouse button on the disk's icon to open the
disk.
4.  Double click the left mouse button on the "Sierra" icon. If you are loading
from a back-up copy you will be prompted to briefly insert the original disk
when loading.
5.  To bypass the opening sequence, press any key.

BACKING UP YOUR PROGRAM MASTERS
From the Workbench, follow the procedure below to copy the original master disk
to a back-up.

One Drive Systems:
1. Insert the original disk in the drive.
2. Place the mouse cursor (arrow) on the master program icon.
3. Highlight the icon by clicking the left mouse button.
4. Place the mouse cursor on the menu bar. Hold down the right mouse button and
pull down the Workbench menu.
5. Place the mouse cursor on Duplicate and release the left mouse button.
6. Follow the disk swap prompts to copy the program disk.
7. Do not rename your back-up copy.

Two Drive Systems:
1. Insert the original and back-up disk in the drives.
2. Place the mouse cursor on the original program disk icon and hold down the
left mouse button.
3. Drag the mouse cursor to the icon of the drive you're copying to and release
the button.
4. Follow the prompts to complete the copy procedure.
5. Do not rename your back-up copy.

FORMATTING A DISK (to be used as a saved game disk)
1. From the Workbench, insert a blank disk into any drive.
2. Place the mouse dursor on the blank disk icon and click the left mouse
button, highlighting the icon.
3. Place the mouse dursor on the menu bar at the top of the screen. Hold down
the right mouse button and pull down the Disk menu.
4. Place the mouse cursor on "initialize" and release the right mouse button.
The blank disk is now being formatted. When formatting is complete, you will be
returned to the Workbench.
5. Place the mouse cursor on the "Empty" icon and click the left mouse button.
Place the mouse cursor on the Workbench menu, hold down the right mouse button,
and select "Rename". Follow the prompts to rename the "saved game" disk. If you
don't rename the "saved game" didk, its default name will be "Empty".
6. When a formatted disk is used for saving games, the 3-D Animated Adventure
automatically creates a saved game directory for saving 12 games. Creating
additional directories on the disk (for saved games), will allow you to save
more games on the formatted disk (12 per directory). Consult your system's DOS
manual for creating directories on a formatted disk.

COMMANDS FOR THE HERO
A joystick, mouse or keyboard moves the main character north, south, east, west
or diagonally. To halt your character's steps with the keyboard, press the last
direction key again, or the 5 on the number pad. If you are using a mouse,
start movement by single clicking the left mouse button. The character will
move to the point where the left mouse button was last clicked and stop there,
unless there is an obstruction in his path.

During the game you can use any form of control at any time. Just click the
mouse, press a direction key, or move the joystick. If the joystick was not
plugged in before loading the game, press CTRL-J and insert the joystick into
joystick port # 2. The joystick will now be active.

    Mouse


Talk to your computer in commands of one or two words, or even simple
sentences. Unless otherwise instructed, follow all commands with the RETURN
key.

You may meet others who have messages for you. Command them to speak. Type:
TALK TO THE GNOME
You may later need objects you see along the way. Type: GET THE KEY
Pay attention to details. To see an object closely, type: LOOK AT THE PANEL
Use the objects you find along the way. Type: GIVE THE BASKET TO THE GIRL

To fully savor a scene you enjoy watching or negotiate a narrow paty, you can
slow down the animation. Speed up the animation to make the main character walk
faster. To change the speed type "slow" or "fast" and press RETURN. To return
to the original speed, type "normal" and press RETURN.

Function and control keys shortcut these common commands:
F1 or HELP	Shows list of control keys (including some specific to your
		game which may not be mentioned here).
F2		Toggle sound on/off
F3		Echo (repeat) previous command
F5		Save game
F7		Restore game
F9		Restart game
CTRL-C or
CTRL-X		Cancel line
CTRL-J		Select joystick mode
ALT-Z		Quit game
TAB		Inventory
ESC		Pause/resume game

SAVING AND RESTORING GAME
To allow for errors in judgement, and also for some pretty creative
exploration, we make it possible for you to save and restore the game. Before
you try something that looks dangerous, or just because you've been playing
awhile and don't want to lose what progress you've made through some chance
encounter, SAVE YOUR GAME.

At any time during the game, tuype "save game" and press return or press F-5 to
save your game. Follow the directions below to complete saving your game.

SINGLE DISK DRIVE USERS
You have a choice of saving your game on your game disk (original or back-up),
or to a formatted "saved game" disk. When you receive the prompt asking on
which directory to save your game, press RETURN and follow the prompts if you
are saving on your game disk. If you use a "saved game" disk, remove the game
disk from the drive, insert the "saved game" didk, and type the name of the
"Saved game" disk followed by ":" and the name of the directory and press
RETURN. Follow the prompts, using the up/down arrow keys to select a saved game
space. Re-insert the game disk to resume playing.

TWO DISK DRIVE USERS
When you receive the prompt asking on which directory to save your game,
backspace through the suggested default name and type the name of your "saved
game" disk with it in one of the drives, and press return. This will allow your
game to be saved onto your second disk drive. If you are using more than one
directory for for saved games, when prompted, type the name of the directory
where you want the game to be saved. Follow the prompts using the up/down arrow
keys to select a saved game space, to complete saving the game.

IN GENERAL
Although your game position is stored on disk as a normal Amiga DOS file, you
are not required to follow Amiga DOS naming conventions in identifying your
saved games. If the character is standing before a tree when you save a game,
call your saved game "STANDING BEFORE A TREE" or whatever has meaning to you.
You may save up to 12 different games per saved game directory.

If you "run out" of saved game spaces in your saved game directory, (and you
don't want to create more saved game directories), you may reuse one of the 12
spaces. To change the name of a saved game, just enter CTRL-C or CTRL-X to
clear the line, and type a new one.

RESTORING A GAME
Type "restore game" and press RETURN or press F-7 to restore a previously saved
game. You will be asked where you saved the game. To accept the default
directory, press RETURN. Otherwise, clear the line, type the name of the "saved
game" disk followed by ":" and the directory on which you saved the game, and
press RETURN. Now choose the game you wish to restore by moving the pointer and
selecting it by pressing RETURN. 


			REFERENCE CARD

HOW TO PLAY SLOTS	1. Walk to the machine. Type "PLAY SLOTS".
			2. When you are finished, type "EXIT SLOTS".

HOW TO PLAY BLACKJACK	The object is to get as close to 21 points as
			possible without going over. Face cards
			count 10 points each, and aces count as 1
			or 11 points, whichever is to your 
			advantage. You are dealt 2 cards to begin with.

HOW TO BET		Sit down at the table. Type "BET". You will be
			asked to specify an amount. (This house only
			accepts bets in $2 increments).

INSURANCE		When the house dealer shows an "Ace Up." You will
			be asked if you want insurance. Insurance equals half
			of your wager. Use insurance cautiously. If the dealer
			has blackjack (21) you will be paid off at 2 to 1 odds.

SURRENDER		If you do not like the odds after reviewing your
			initial two cards, you may "SURRENDER." Half of your
			wager will be refunded to you.

TAKING CARDS		After receiving your first two cards, you must decide
			if you want to take more or to "STAND" on what you've
			got. Type the appropriate option.

DOUBLING DOWN		You are allowed to "double down" if your cards show a
			value of 10 or 11. Your bet is doubled and you are
			dealt one more card.

SPLITS			If the house deals you a pair (any two like cards, i.e.
			two tens) you may "SPLIT" them. This move allows you 
			to play two hands and double your bet.

TO QUIT PLAYING		Type "STAND UP" at the end of a hand.

TALKING TO WOMEN	Learning this will be your number one priority while in
			Lost Wages. When you want to talk to a woman, type
			"TALK TO THE WOMAN". If you happen to get her name,
			type "TALK TO (NAME)".
			Women can be loads of fun. They are great to "LOOK"
			at. They are fun to "DANCE" with. You could even try
			to "KISS" them. Nothing is off-limits if you "PLAY
			YOUR CARDS RIGHT".
			Women are also fickle. Do not take "no" for an answer.
			Be persistent. With a little sweat and a lot of luck
			you could wind up being a happy guy.

TRANSPORTING YOURSELF	Getting from place to place is very crucial. To walk
			somewhere, simply use the direction keys, your joystick
			or a mouse. You can move Larry practically anywhere.

TAXI SERVICE		Catching cabs in a convenient way to get around Lost
			Wages. Look for taxi stand signs near the curb at most
			major establishments. Please note that you should not
			keep a taxi waiting. When the cab pulls up, walk
			directly to the rear door and type "ENTER CAB".

ELEVATORS		You can use elevators anywhere they are accessible. The
			Lost Wages Casino is a full nine stories tall - a trip
			up the stairs could waste your whole night. Just walk 
			into the elevator car and type "PRESS ONE" (or
			whichever floor you choose). Note that some elevators
			are restricted in use.

		LEISURE SUIT LARRY IN THE LAND OF THE LOUNGE LIZARDS

This is what Larry Laffer used to look like (pathetic, isn't it?). Notice the
receding hairline and expanding waist. The cardigan sweater and pocket
protector give you a pretty good idea of what is - a totally mild and lazy guy.

The "old" Larry Laffer was a confirmed bachelor. At 38 years old, he still
lived with his mother, and the idea of asking a woman out was, basically,
terrifying. He felt more comfortable at night curling up with a good book (his
vavorite, "Know Your RS-232 Serial Port") and listening to his record
collection, which absolutely reeked of Air Supply and Barry Manilow records.

Then one day it hit him. Larry realized that his opportunity to live was
passing faster than an ugly woman on the way to her wedding. So he decided to
change. "No more Mr. Nice Guy!" he shouted. "It's time to party!"

This is the new Larry Laffer. Underneath all the polyester and gold, he is
still the same weenie he always was, but after a credit card blitz at the Night
Fever Polyester Plaza Larry is equipped for a night on the town. Notice the
solid white leisure suit, genuine gold-laquered chains, the "steppin' out"
elevator shoes and the "Saturday Night Fever" style bouffant haircut
(guaranteed to get the chicks - by the truckload!) A few nights at the Disco On
Fire Health Club and Dance Spa has given Larry new confidence, new grace, and a
360-degree move that has to be seen to be believed.

Now Larry Laffer has landed in Lost Wages for one fabulous evening.

Watch out world, here he comes.

AN OVERVIES
A Sierra 3-D Animated Adventure Game, simply stated, is an interactive movie
where you become the main character. In this game, the main character is
"Leisure Suit" Larry Laffer, a would be man-about-town and exceptionally mild
and lazy guy. The "movie" takes place in the fictional town of Lost Wages.

Each 3-D Animated Adventure Game has a main goal, and yours in Leisure Suit
Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is to find a seduce the girl of your
dreams. This goal won't come easy, because you only have one night, and
unfortunately, you are stuck with Larry's looks. Other problems, such as lack
of money, lack of opportunity, and bad breath can complicate things
significantly. Your interaction with the game controls the outsome of each
situation.

For example, having your character sign on with a major league baseball team or
start a successful men's magzine could be beneficial to your ultimate goal. On
the other hand, catching a fatal disease or losing all your cash can only
impede your progress.

A combination of common sense, logical thinking, and downright sheer luck is
needed to achieve your goal. Good luck.

			TIPS FOR NEW ADVENTURE PLAYERS
NOTE: IF YOU HAVE PLAYED AN ANIMATED ADVENTURE BEFORE, THIS SECTION CAN BE
SKIPPED.

1.  HOW TO MOVE AROUND
Basic instructions on how to interact with this game are included on the
command card enclosed. If you are not sure of what to do, follow the WALK THRU
at the end of this manual.

2. IT PAYS TO USE PROTECTION
Due to the dangerous nature of this (and every) adventure game, you will want
to type SAVE GAME many times during a playing session. Type SAVE GAME  any time
you have done something important. Type SAVE GAME when you feel you're in
danger.

RESTORE GAME is used when you were right, and there was danger. If you get
killed, type RESTORE GAME rather than starting over. Careful and diligent use
of this function has saved many an adventurer from frustration and impotence.

(For more on save and restore game, see Reference Card enclosed).

3. LOOK AT EVERYTHING
When you enter a room type LOOK AT THE ROOM. When you enter a street, type LOOK
AT THE STREET. When you want to talk to a woman, type TALK TO THE WOMAN. The
descriptions and close-ups offered may provide valuable clues.

4. PLAY WITH A FRIEND
When it comes to playing Leisure Suit Larry, more heads are better than one.
You may find it very helpful, and more fun, to go through this game with a
friend.

5. A FEW CHOICE WORDS
This 3-D Animated Adventure Game understands a number of verbs such as:
BLOW UP		EAT		ORDER
BUY		GET		READ
CHANGE		GIVE		TAKE
COUNT		JUMP		UNDRESS
CUT		KISS		USE
DRINK		LOOK		WEAR
DROP		OPEN

Naturally, not all of these words are understood in every situation. (This is a
grphic adventure after all), nor will these words all fit into one sentence,
but you can string these words into commands such as "COUNT THE MONEY" and "USE
THE KINKY DEVICE".

6.  YOU'VE GOT TO BE OPEN MINDED
If it's silly, rude, dirty or funny, Al Lowe and Mark Crowe probably thought of
it when they were writing this program. Some of the puzzles in this game may
require deranged thinking to solve.

You should try anything you can think of. After all, no one ever got a social
disease from a keyboard, and you have your RESTORE GAME function if things
really backfire on you.

7. IF YOU STILL CAN'T FINISH
Feeling frustrated? Can't finish what you started. Is your wife making fun of
you?

Even the best adventurers sometimes can't complete their tasks. (For text
adventure players, this is almost a chronic disorder.)

For this reason, hint books for all of the 3-D Animated Adventures are
available. You can order the hint book for this game using the order form in
this package. Don't be embarrassed, it happens to us all sometimes. If you just
want to talk about your problem, call the Sierra Customer Support Line at
(209)683-6858 or the Sierra Bulletin Board Service at (209)683-4463. (We
promise to be discreet).
