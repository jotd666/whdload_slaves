OF ONE OF VALDYN'S LIVES. IF VALDYN MAKES CONTACT WITH AN OPPONENT, ONE OF
THE BRIGHT RED HEART TURNS DARK RED.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF BRIGHT RED AND DARK RED HEARTS SHOWS THE MAXIMUM ENERGY
OF VALDYN ON ONE LEVEL. HEARTS WICH ARE ONLY SHOWN IN OUTLINE ARE INACTIVE.
FURTHER DETAILS ARE GIVEN UNDER "BONUS POINTS, ENERGY CRYSTALS" AND 
" ENERGY DRINKS ".

VARIOUS DIFFERENT SWORD ALONG HIS WAY. THE STRIKING POWER OF THE SWORD

		TIPS 
FAMILIARISE YOURSELF WITH THE CONTROLS. PRACTICE ALL THE MOVEMENTS AND THE
BATTLE STRIKES BEFORE YOU GO SEARCHING FOR LIONHEART.

YOU SHOULD ESPECIALY PRACTICE THE BATTLE STRIKE JUMP: MANY OF YOUR OPPONENTS 
CAN BE DESTROYED WITH THIS IN ONE SINGLE HIT! TO REPEAT THE BATTLE STRIKE 
SEVERAL TIMES YOU NEED ONLY PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON AGAIN WHILST PULLING
DOWN ON THE JOSYTICK. IF VALDYN HITS HIS OPPENENT, VALDYN IS CATAPULTED 
UPWARDS. 
ON EACH LEVEL THERE ARE HIDDEN THINGS WHICH MAKE THE TASK EASIER FOR YOU.
ON MOST LEVEL THERE IS ALSO A SECRET AREA WHICH IS VERY CAREFULLY CONCEALED.
IF YOU CAN'T PROGRESS ON ONE LEVEL, SEARCH THROUGH THE PREVIOUS LEVELS IN CASE
YOU MISSED THEBONUS POINTS WHICH WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO PROGRESS.

NOTE THAT VALDYN ALWWAYS RUNS FASTER UP OR DOWN SLOPES. THIS FACT CAN BE USED 
TO MAKE HIM JUMP FURTHER. 

VALDYN IS A MEMBER OF THE CAT PEOPLE RACE. IF HE HAS TO CROSS A RIVER OR GET
THROUGH A FLOODED PASSAGEWAY YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT HE CANNOT SWIM. FOR
THIS REASON, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU ALWAYS KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER.

MANY OF THE PLATTFORMS VALDYN MUST STAND ON DURING HIS TRAVELS CAN BE MADE TO
MOVE LIKE SWINGS. PULL THE STICK DOWN DURING THE SWIMMING TO INCREASE ITS
MOVEMENTS. MOVE THE STICK UP TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF SWING. 
BY THE WAY.... IN MODUS 'HARD' YOU WILL NOT ONLY ATTACKED BY HARDER ENEMIES;
WE ALSO CHANGED THE LEVELS ITSELF. THAT MEANS, THAT YOU HAVE GOT TWO GAMES
IN ONE.

HAVE FUN WHILE PLAYING THE GAME ......
