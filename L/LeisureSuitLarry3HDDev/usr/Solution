                LEISURE SUIT LARRY 3....THE SOLUTION

By ???. Edited by PARASITE.


NOW, ON TO THE HISTORY OF LARRY 3...
 The Larry series, as most of you probably know, is unlike most games. It's
more of a "Pornographic Sex Adventure" where you are the bumbling Larry
Laffer, on his never ending quest for pussy. This one is quite unique however
since you are TWO characters, Larry, and Passionate Patti (Larry's beloved?)..

About halfway through the game you will switch into Patti.... I wont go into
that now.. There is one part to note, there will be a set of commands called
"LEI COMMANDS", they are shortened and are the following set of instructions:
Go to cave by Chip-n-Dales
Enter cave
Save game
go to edge of cliff
get flowers
make lei
exit cave
go back to whatever you were doing before..Since we had to finish this game
with these commands like 5 times due to flowers wilting, well...
(This would only be necessary with pati, but it increases the score to make lei
for other girls)

Also, you can beat the 4000 point score, we finished it with 4337 today
