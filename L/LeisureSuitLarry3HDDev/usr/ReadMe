 This install applies to "Leisure Suit Larry 3" © 1991 Sierra.

 Working disk images are available on Back2Roots website

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.1 (14.07.2020):
 - Password protection removed on german/english version recently supported in 2.0 (issue #0004751)

 - support for german version (issue #0004053). Password protection NOT removed,
   please log a mantis but report and include savegames before ticket sales & locker
 - MT32 optional support (no need to rename files in the installation) for versions
   that support it. Make sure that res_mt32.cfg and mt32.drv as well as devs/serial.device
   are copied in your "data" directory (previous installations didn't do it)
   
 version 1.5:
 - Fixed install script issues with 4 & 5 disk versions (issue #0002323)
   Now install script asks for the number of disks your version has instead
   of trying to guess it!
   
 version 1.4 (26.06.2016)
 - Fixed 68000/68010 compatibility (issue #0002896)

 version 1.3-B (27.07.10)
 - Fixed install script to support disk 5 (Thanks Mad-Matt@EAB)

 version 1.3 (09.06.07)
 - included Al Lowe's fixes to solve the workout bug and others on fast machines
   (taken from http://www.allowe.com, machine independent, thanks to Hubert for
   pointing that out)

 version 1.2 (15.08.03)
 - another version supported (Thanks Hubert Maier for disk images)
   the new supported version is the one with better (sampled) music

 version 1.1 (07.08.03)
 - ticket manual protection removed (just type anything)
 - locker manual protection removed (just type any number everytime you need 
   to open the locker)
 - source code included
 - now needs WHDLoad v16 (no ugly kickstart load OS swap at startup)
 - added Trivia Quizz answers

 version 1.0 (01.08.03) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - fixed for fast memory (access fault in sound driver fixed)
 - original quit option quits to WB
 - solution/hints included
 - protections NOT removed

 Notes:
 - to reuse your old savegame disk, just copy it in the data/save directory
 - I also included a savegame with the 5 nasty questions correctly answered
 - I completed the game with the WHDLoad loader so I consider it fully tested,
   and I really enjoyed it since it's full of cool animations :)
 - The only "protection" left is the bamboo jungle maze walkthrough, even if
   you could figure out the directions after several tries...

   The actual directions are 

     N N E E N W N
     E N N N
     W W S W
     W N N W N

 Al Lowe's Fixes in v1.3:
  - Cherri Tart's striptease
  - Larry's cross-dressing striptease
  - Fat City workout --- the number of exercises you'll need to do on each
    machine is now fixed to 25.
  - Elevator

 Note about using saved games:
  You must restore a game saved prior to entering an area whose script code
  is patched. For example, games that were saved INSIDE the workout room
  will NOT work.

 If you can, use the german/english version that comes in 5 disks. Since 2.1, it has copy protection
 removed, and even if it starts in german (which can be a problem for the questions at startup), you can switch
 language to english by the menu afterwards.
