 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick345.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.0 (12.09.03) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - compatible with all cracks/BTTR/original version
 - disk protection removed (as a bonus the nice cracktro is included)
 - nice icons by Exoticons
 - solution / manual / trivia quiz included
 - uses fastmem
 - source code included

Note: original version does not have a startup-sequence nor a boot sector. The only
way to create one is to copy it on the disk used for the install. You can decide to
let the install script create it on the original disk, but since the disk may be very
old, it may be wiser to install the game from a copy or a virtual floppy drive.
The slave detects a non-bootable disk and writes a bootable bootblock on the image
(but there was no simple way to create a s/startup-sequence file on the image)
