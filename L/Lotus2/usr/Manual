LOTUS TURBO CHALLENGE II

For Gremlin Graphics, Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge has been one of our most
successful titles ever.  It has met with both critical and commercial
acclaim, and when we released it, we thought `What can you do to beat
that?'  We didn`t think that we could add anything, but the people who
bought Lotus told us differently.  Within days of the original release, we
were receiving bundles of mail that said 'Brilliant game, but what if...'

What if we introduced a full screen single player mode?
What if we introduced a machine to machine link up allowing up to four
players?
What if we added more cars? Oncoming traffic? Weather conditions? City
Driving? Night Driving? Fog?

Now's your chance to find out...


PLAYING LOTUS TURBOI CHALLENGE II

Once you have loaded Turbo Challenge II, an introduction sequence will
begin.  Hit the fire button on your joystick to skip past this.  The next
thing presented on screen will be the main options screen.  To alter
anything, simply move your joystick around.  The red box will move around,
and whichever option is currently surrounded by the red box is the
available option.  Most options offer two choices, and pressing fire when
an option is highlighted will flip between the two.

The following options are offered.

PLAYER ONE NAME (1)
If you wish to change the name, simply highlight this option and type in
the new name.

PASSWORD (2)
To enter a password, highlight this option and type in a new password.

STAGES AND CHECKPOINTS
The game is played over a number of stages, eight in total, each one made
up of a number of checkpoints, which will vary between six and ten,
depending upon the stage.  The player must reach the next designated
checkpoint within the allotted time in order to continue racing.  The
objective, obviously, is to reach the final checkpoint on any stage ahead
of your opponents, and within the given time.

Each stage takes place in a different part of America, and each has a
password which will allow you to start on that stage in future races.  Each
has its own hazards and dangers, from ice to giant boulders.  The stages,
which will also determine whether you drive a Lotus Esprit or a Lotus
Elan, are in the following order.


THE STAGES

FOREST:  FIVE CHECKPOINTS
Dense trees line this stage, and you will find water, trees and logs
strewn across the track.  Hitting a log, however, will cause the car to
do a spectacular jump, which can be used for overtaking or jumping over
other hazards.

NIGHT:  SEVEN CHECKPOINTS
The darkness will be your biggest enemy, as it will make the track beyond
a certain distance obscure to you.  This stage also contains some long
tunnels, but it is a relatively fast section of the race.

FOG:  EIGHT CHECKPOINTS
Unlike this onbe.  This is one of the more difficult stages, with fog
serving to obscuree your vision to a very high degree.  Low visibility and
twisting roads will make this section very difficult.

SNOW:  SIX CHECKPOINTS
Tress and bushes could again prove to make the going difficult on this
section.  Add to this the driving snow, ice patches and lighter than light
steering, and you know you've got a challenge on your hands.

DESERT:  TEN CHECKPOINTS
Not the easiest surface to race on.  Try to stick to the centre of the
road, where there is less sand to clog up your car.  Towards the edge there
will be more sand, and in some places small sand drifts will prove
hazardous.

CITY:  EIGHT CHECKPOINTS
There are two lanes in this stage, and its up to you whether you want to
take chances- If you cross over to the right hand lane, there will be less
traffic going in your direction, but a lot more coming towards you.  This
is very difficult.  In addition, there are also lorries crossing your path
at the intersections.  You could avoid them, but managing to drive
underneath them will earn you extra points.

MARSH:  TEN CHECKPOINTS
Oil and Water make the going tough, but on this stage you'll be given some
help in the shape of green time bonuses to be found on the road.

STORM:  SIX CHECKPOINTS
Wild rain, thunder and lightning serve to slow you, but again theres extra
help on hand for the final stage of the race.  Red turbos, which are
activated as you pick them up, will give you an extra burst of speed.

RACING
If you choose one player, then you will be presented with a full screen
view of the first section once it has loaded.  The screen layout is as
follows:

Your speed is indicated in the top left hand corner of the playing screen,
with your revs directly underneath, and your gear underneath this.  In the
top right hand corner is your score, with the relative postion indicator if
you are in multi-player mode below this, and your time remaining beneath
this.

TWO/THREE/FOUR PLAYER OPTIONS
If you chose a multiple player option, another icon will appear on the
screen underneath your score.  This indicates the positions of the other
players relative to you.  Look at the example shown here, which is Player
One in a four player game.  The central vertical bar represents the
position of Player One, and so any other player to the right of this is in
front of Player One, and anyone to the left is behind.  As it is shown
here, it indicates that Player Two, forward of the central bar, is just in
front of Player One.  Player Three is leading, and Player Four is last.  In
multi-player mode, if one player finishes a stage, then all players will
begin the next stage, regardless of performance on the last.

            -------------------------


LINKING TWO COMPUTERS
Linking two computers is possible with Lotus II.  Two Amigas, or two ST's
can be linked, offering a number of new opportunities.  Obviously, each
machine will need a copy of Lotus II.  Two players can now race, each with
full screen view.  Alternatively, three or even four players can race
simultaeneoulsy with a split screen view.

You will need to purchase a null modem cable to link the serial ports of
the two computers.  These can be purchased (funnily enough -ED) from
Gremlin Graphics for 9.99.  Once the two computers are linked, you need do 
no more, except select the two computer link up option indicated on the
main menu above.  If you wish to have three players, select one player on
one computer, and two on the other.  Obviously, if you wish to have four
players, then you select two players on both machines.

End.
