 That install applies to "Lotus Turbo Challenge II" © 1991 Magnetic Fields
 Ltd. and Gremlin Ltd.
 Supported is the original release, the version from "Lotus Trilogy", the
 Amiga Fun rerelease and the North America release (which is in real a
 modified version of the Company crack).

 That install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing Help (key can be changed with Tooltype
 "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try first to get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad's WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also doesn't succeeds inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad's WWW-Page.

 For full WHDLoad package, other installs and updates refer to:

 Features:
 - setting Tooltype "ButtonWait" the game will wait for pressing the joystick
   fire button before a race starts
 - setting Tooltype "Custom1=1" the game configuration (players name, gear
   type, 2 player mode...) will be saved automatically after it has been
   changed and loaded on startup
 - setting Tooltype "Custom2=1" the highscores will be saved automatically
   after a player has entered it
 - manual protection from the original release removed
 - some bugs removed and delays inserted

 Please note that there is no real NTSC version of this game! The version
 sold in north america is a crack of the PAL version. The game works somehow
 in NTSC but the music is played too fast, the game itself is too fast and
 there are some graphics glitches.

 Thanks to Mr.Larmer for the old Lotus2-Install from which the decruncher
 source and some infos has been used and to Harry and Ungi for images and
 testing.
