 This install applies to "Laser Squad" © 1988 Teque, 1 disk

 Thanks to Angus, Solo, Matthew, and all the others who sent or proposed me
 unsupported versions of this popular game.

 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de
