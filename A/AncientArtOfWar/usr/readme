Requirements:

 The game requires a installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

History:

version 1.1 (04/03/2020):

- added icons from Irek
- added translated loading pic (only visible with BUTTONWAIT) by DamienD

version 1.0 (24/02/2020) done by JOTD:

- option to use full english translation (took a while to achieve)
  from french version
- french & spanish versions supported
- password protection removed
- keyboard routine fixed
- added manual OCR'ed from original english manual
- stupid hardware disk checks removed for data disk
- cpu dependent loops fixed
- fixed to run with fast memory
- support for both french & spanish versions
- buttonwait allows to see intro picture (in french/spanish)
- added wait for left mouse button when giving up the game
- source code included, including python scripts used to rip/build the images & texts

The game has been translated to english by JOTD using:

- MS-DOS version for texts & title screen (after heavy rework of colors & shades)
- GIMP to rework text as images (most small font text are actually images)
- custom-made python tools to convert bitplanes to and from png images
- custom-made python tools to extract the text from binary/text mixed files to json
  and back (after translation)

The internal image format is really strange and I thought it would be easier to
"subtitle" the graphics when detecting given patterns on the screen rather than decode
the internal file format, rework & rebuild the original files with reworked graphics.
The result looks very neat now.

After 15 years sitting on my hard drive this patch is finally complete and translated
to english. Enjoy.

Remaining possible issues:

- translation: "O" of "ouest" on the map was not translated as "W", because there were color issues,
  and it's not a big problem anyway.
- translation: Some word wrap on proverbs is incorrect sometimes
- translation: maybe some end of game stuff isn't translated (when you won)
- The spanish version I have doesn't seem to have password protection
  Maybe it's a crack, so if you have the original with a password, send it!
- missing game icon. If you have one, please provide
