 This install applies to "Adventure Construction Set" © 1986 Electronic Arts

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.6 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.1 (09.11.10) done by JOTD:
 - sound was missing (not enough memory in the slave) (issue #2332)

 version 1.0 (29.04.05) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - hidden ROM accesses fixed (same as Marble Madness): crashed
 - disk protection fully removed
 - smart install system to dodge the read file protection bits on disk
 - save adventure to disk
 - manual included
 - source code included

 notes:
 - 2 directories "userdata0" and "userdata1" contain the virtual DF0
   and DF1 contents (user created or saved game data)

 - protection was very similar to Marble Madness, with all the EOA early
   encryption and $FCxxxx read shit. Thanks Derek Noomburg again for
   Marble Madness patch (as for Archon, Archon 2, Skyfox)

 - thanks to Lockpick for the crack (actually this is a lame crack
   because it needs the disk in the drive and accesses it but it helped
   me to create a clean crack, without any disk access)

 - if anyone comes up with an icon, I'll include it in an update
