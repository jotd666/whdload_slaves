                                  INTRODUCTION:
                            How To Use This Clue Book

Part One is for players who don't like to be slapped in the face & shown
things. It focuses on the most perplexing puzzles that the average player
will encounter in Altered Destiny, then offers aid in the form of a series
of clues.

These clues don't necessarily give you everything - for example, you may get
help with one puzzle in a particular area, yet miss important objects needed
to solve another, later puzzle. But Part One does offer a way to complete
the game without being spoon-fed the answers from a crystal bowl.

Part Two offers the straight solutions to all of the puzzles in Altered
Destiny. This section walks you to the final solution, screen-by-screen, in
a most expedient manner. Only The Desperate may use this section. All others
will be hunted down and publicly humiliated.

Part Three gives you a list of all the things you need to do to achieve a
perfect score of 350.

Part Four gives you a map of the game, and some blank pages for note-taking.

                                       -1-



                                 PART ONE: Clues

The section below lists the stickiest problems P.J. Barrett will face in
Altered Destiny, then offers a series of clues to help you solve them. These
clues are numbered in a column, and each successive clue reveals a little
bit more - descending from quiet, subtle hints to aggressive pointing and
yelling.

The clues are hidden under the weird red space slime that we smeared on the
pages. Just place the enclosed window viewer over the stated problem, then
slide it slowly down over the red area. The first clue will appear. Read
clues one at a time, in sequential order from top to bottom.


                                FLOATING VILLAGE


Problem: Will I ever get back to see Trudy?

  1  JonQuah brought you here, maybe he can send you back.
  2  But he can't while he's restrained by Helmar.
  3  You will be reunited with Trudy when you overcome Helmar and the Jewel
     of Light is returned to its proper place.


Problem: How can I get down from the Floating Village?

  1  The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind.
  2  Take a floater.
  3  No, take the small floater.


                                       -2-


Problem: Hey, there's another floating island! How do I get over there?

  1  To solve this one, you need to be a bit edgy.
  2  If you're in the right place, you'll get some assistance at Land's End.
  3  Stand on the far east rock ledge at Land's End and a transporter will
     arrive.


Problem: I keep getting this sinking feeling when I step on the transporter.

  1  It's such a heavy subject, i'm not sure what to say.
  2  Ever heard about the camel's back and the straw?
  3  You're carrying too much. Lighten your load before you step on the
     transporter.


Problem: How can I take the frags from Tentro's shop?

  1  There's a golden oppurtunity to take them if you use the right equipment.
  2  Have you looked at the golden tube?
  3  Point the golden tube at the frags.


Problem: I've brought Vindah the requested wildlife, but he's not divining.
         Now what?

  1  Maybe divinations are more complex than you thought at first.
  2  Try asking Vindah about the divination again.
  3  You also need to bring the pomenta leaf frm the Bottom of the Hill in
     the Forest of Dreams.


                                       -3-


                                   WEIRD WOODS


Problem: How can I prevent the Hoppa from sprinkling me?

  1  Maybe you shoudl talk to teh Hoppa.
  2  Maybe you should run from teh Hoppa.
  3  Maybe being sprinkled is a good thing, sooner or later.


Problem: I've heard of living in harmony with nature, but this is a bit much.
         How do I keep from "taking root"?

  1  Looks like you need an antidote.
  2  If an animal made you a plant maybe a plant could.
  3  Eat the defoil herb from the Canyons of Fear.


Problem: Where is the Indella bird hiding?

  1  Indella birds are almost always high.
  2  You're used to being upwardly mobile. Why not mine this talent?
  3  Stand by the web in Tree Base. Climb up. Travel around. You'll know it
     when you see it.


Problem: Where can i get a bird-holding device?

  1  Someone in the Floating Village could give you a hand.
  2  Have you read the back of the Altered Destiny box?
  3  Ask Alnar to make a cage for you.


Problem: I've got a great place to put the bird, but the bird won't come
         within reach. Now what?

  1  Vindah has some advice if you ask him about the Indella bird.
  2  Do you have anything you could use to lure the bird into the cage?
  3  Set the trap, then bait the cage with wither the popcorn or the bottle
     of pigment from Tentro's Shop.


                                       -4-


                                FOREST OF DREAMS


Problem: What is it that the chief pomenta plant wants from me?

  1  Try Standing in the water of the Weird Woods. Drop anything.
  2  Did you pet the flubox?
  3  Are you reading all the clues just for the heck of it? There is no
     chief pomenta plant.


Problem: All this walking is making me tired. Isn't there somewhere I could
         get some rest?

  1  Sure there is. You just need a good place to hang out.
  2  The fluboxes are good at choosing comfortable napping areas.
  3  Sleep in the hammock.


Problem: I keep snoozing. What's the point?

  1  Make a conscious decision to have some unconscious visions.
  2  Dream.


Problem: What are those arcane symbols in P.J.'s dream? Is it some kind of
         ancient, iconic code?

  1  Don't you watch re-runs?
  2  Those are some of the greatest TV shows of all time - My Three Sons, I
     Spy, The Lone Ranger and Gilligan's Island.
  3  None of those are important - other than the fact that they warped the
     psyche of an entire generation.
  4  But you'd better pay attention to Vindah's message at the end.


                                       -5-


Problem: This pit looks pretty interesting. Can I stick around?

  1  Uncontrolled astral projection can snap you back to reality very quickly.
  2  Take charge of the situation.
  3  Wake up while you're at the Boiling Pits.


Problem: I keep taking my last gasp in the green mist. Help!

  1  The boiling acid is poisonous and so are the fumes. There must be another
     way to get to the next area.
  2  Look around teh boiling pits. Notice any geological features that weren't
     in the Forest of Dreams?
  3  Push the rocks By a Cliff Edge. Climb down.


Problem: That poor, sobbing creature! How can I help her?

  1  It will take sharp wits and a good sense of balance.
  2  Looks like a case where the dead could help the dreaming.
  3  Cut the trees with a sharp instrument from Alnar's. Now you can walk
     between them, if you're careful.


Problem: I want to get back to reality!

  1  Going backward will move you forward.
  2  How did you get here in the first place?
  3  Retrace your steps. Sleep, then wake up when you're back in the Forest
     of Dreams.


                                       -6-


                               ORDER OF THE JEWEL


Problem: This is avery exclusive group! How do I enter?

  1  Have you looked at the plate By a Cliff?
  2  You can't enter the order without an invitation.
  3  When the golden tube is holding the frags from Tentro's shop, point it
     at the plate.


Problem: Lantra seems stubborn about giving away her possessions.

  1  Her first priority is how her garden grows.
  2  Asking Lantra about the crystals might help you solve this.
  3  Bring Lantra some water and she will give you her pouches.


Problem: I've seen lots of what Lantra needs but I don't have anything
         in which to carry it.

  1  A suitable item is somewhere in the Weird Woods.
  2  You'll have to stretch a bit for this one.
  3  Stand by the web at the Tree Base. Climb up. Wander around any you'll
     find a seed shell.
  4  Fill the seed shell with water.


Problem: I'm not able to make a scroll.

  1  Mind your manners.
  2  Make your desires clear.
  3  Ask Towhee for the scroll.


                                       -7-


Problem: The scrollworms are taking my leaf. How can I stop them?

  1  Scrollworms are attracted to any paper-like object.
  2  You could hide the leaf in the secret cave down the north cliff of the
     Floating Village.
  3  There is no secret cave. Listen, you're reading the hints just to see
     what they say. We've talked about this before.


Problem: What good is this small pouch?

  1  It seems fertile with possibilites, particularly in a land where one
     reaps what one sows.
  2  If you're in the dark on this issue, you're on the right path.
  3  Drop teh small pouch anywhere in the Order of the Jewel and take
     the round crystal that grows from it.


Problem: I got the scroll from Towhee. But it doesn't contain the
         horticultural information I need.

  1  Towhee would be glad to return one favor with another.
  2  Don't be as shortsighte as Towhee is. The little fellow clearly needs an
     optical boost.
  3  Do you have some sort of lense-like object?
  4  Give the round crystal to Towhee.


Problem: The Guardian of The Order really burns me up.

  1  You have to pay attention to fragmented information.
  2  Have you looked at each of the frags?
  3  When the golden tube is holding the frags, point it at the plate inside
     the Order of the Jewel. The Guardian will let you pass.


                                       -8-


                                 CANYONS OF FEAR


Problem: The wraiths keep overwhelming me. How can I defeat them?

  1  Vindah will give you a clue, if you see him in the Forest of Dreams.
  2  A brave man will succeed where a coward would fail.
  3  Don't move until the wariths have solidified.


Problem: What can I use to take away some slime?

  1  It's a very familiar object.
  2  This calls for something from home.
  3  Fill the empty bowl with the slime.


Problem: I see an interesting plant, but I can't take it.

  1  It's dangerous to harvest alien plants when you have no information on
     what they do.
  2  A library is a good place to start a research project.
  3  Towhee, in The Order of The Jewel, has a scroll about the defoil herb.
     Read the scroll and you will be able to take the herb.


Problem: I can't reach the arrow.

  1  Good thing you work out at the club on a regular basis.
  2  Time to get physical.
  3  Stand by the toes of the Yula's hind foot. Climb up and then walk across
     the webs.


                                       -9-


Problem: A horde of ravenous scavengers keep putting a damper on my day.

  1  When the Kleegs stole your finds, wasn't there something very like a
     clue printed across the screen?
  2  There's no way to keep Kleegs from objects that are dropped in their
     territory.
  3  Drop anything you don't want the Kleegs to mess with in any other
     scene. Retrieve your inventory when you're done here.


Problem: That Kleeg really upsets my balance. What can I do?

  1  Kleegs get bored and mischievous when there isn't anything else to do.
  2  Kleegs will eat to the point of stupor, given the oppurtunity.
  3  Drop the bowl of popcorn before you begin the climb.



                                 CAVES OF DEATH


Problem: An axe-wielding bad guy keeps killing me. How can I win?

  1  P.J. is used to pushing people around when he has to.
  2  P.J.'s in good shape ... but he's not going to beat this creature
     bare-handed.
  3  Wield the axe or the sword from Alnar's.
  4  Once combat begins, move straight towards the aRRaRRa until the creature
     falls off the platform.


                                      -10-


Problem: I'm using a finely crafted blade, but the aRRaRRa isn't getting the
         point.

  1  If you're blunt, while dealing with the aRRaRRa, you won't succeed.
  2  Even the best of swords can't stand abuse.
  3  If you used the sword for wood cutting, it is useless for fighting.
     Use something else.
  4  Wield the axe to combat the aRRaRRa


Problem: Where is the switch that turns off the light?

  1  Look under the platform.
  2  Look at the light.
  3  There is no switch to turn off the light.


Problem: I'm suspended over the pool. How can I leave?

  1  Read the message that's scratched into the stone.
  2  To exit, you need to take a plunge.
  3  Move off the platform so that you fall into the Pool.
  4  Oh yeah, Make sure you've been sprinkled by the Hoppa first so that you
     thrive in the intense light.


Problem: Well, here I am On The Stairs. But there appears to be no exit.

  1  Sometimes you just have to plunge ahead, and have faith.
  2  Walk to the stairs at the bottom right. An extension will appear that
     leads to teh next area.
  

                                      -11-


Problem: The clamchops like me all too well.

  1  Did you look at the mound of stones when you were back On The Steps?
  2  Seems like you need a multi-faceted solution to bridge the gap.
  3  Throw the large pouch.
  4  Walk across trhe bridge.


Problem: How can I continue beyond the floating floor?

  1  Did you look at the markings in the descent tube?
  2  The circles on the floor seem to have a numerical pattern.
  3  Step on squares that have only one or four circles on them until you
     reach the square that has no circles.


Problem: I keep withering away in the dark.

  1  You're just not feeling like yourself, that's all. If you did, you
     wouldn't be afraid of the dark.
  2  The Pool of Dark is the antithesis of photosynthesis.
  3  Eat the defoil herb from teh Canyons of Fear before stepping into the
     Pool of Darkness.



                                   HOWLER LAKE


Problem: I don't have the foggiest idea how to keep the Howlers from killing
         me.

  1  Howlers use sound as their weapon.
  2  You need to meet a master of silence and noise. (Maybe you already have.)
  3  Before you got o Howler Lake, turn on the silencer that JonQuah gives
     you in the Caves of Death.


                                      -12-


Problem: How can I get from the causeway to the isalnd?

  1  If you reflect on this problem, you'll solve it.
  2  You need to show the locals you are here.
  3  Signal with the mirror, then ride the Boteman to the isalnd.



                                  CASTLE ISLAND


Problem: These noisomes are deathly annoying.

  1  Even the silencer can't make you quiet enough to fool the sensitive
     noisomes.
  2  Have you noticed their ears?
  3  Squeeze the Kleeg from the Canyons of Fear.


Problem: Geez, I just don't react well to the purple blobs.

  1  Look at the purple blobs.
  2  Listen to the purple blobs.
  3  Avoid brushing into the purple blobs while walking.


Problem: The leech trees want more than I can give. What can I do?

  1  This is definitley a sticky situation.
  2  If conditions are right, trouble will slide right off your back.
  3  You need some kind of substance to keep grabby trees from holding on to
     you.
  4  Pour the slime from the Canyons of Fear on P.J.


Problem: The front door of the castle is locked!

  1  Hmmm... perhaps a door unlocking device? Like, say, a key?
  2  Have you read the written scroll from Towhee?
  3  Unlock teh door with the arrow from the Canyons of Fear.


                                      -13-



                                INSIDE THE CASTLE


Problem: Is this a one-room castle?

  1  You don't have to use your bootstraps for this one.
  2  Have you looked at all the objects in teh room?
  3  Pull on the rope to start on your explorations.


Problem: I don't even have a chance against Helmar.

  1  The obvious route is not always the best one.
  2  You should take advantage of any openings you're given.
  3  As you go by the first door in the crystal shaft, jump.


Problem: An amazing maze. How do I find my way out?

  1  Since you didn't bring a compass, some other directional guide would
     be of assistance.
  2  Vindah foresaw that you would come this far.
  3  Look at the divination of the leaf.
  4  Follow the Indella bird's instructions. Go east, east, east then
     north, through the middle, "solid" wall.


Problem: I've got a shot, but I still lose this most important confrontation
         with Helmar.

  1  Helmar is blind to his own corruption.
  2  If Helmar saw what he has become, he would be overwhelmed.
  3  Choose the mirror to show Helmar the face of his own evil.


                                      -14-



                                PART TWO: Answers

This section charts a direct path to the "solution" for Altered Destiny. The
path takes you from section to section, listing everything you must do in the
correct order. Note that anything written in CAPITAL LETTERS indicates a
command that you must actually type - remember, though, that the game
recognizes any combination of upper/lower case letters when you type a
command.

The answers here are presented in efficent "chronological" order. As a result,
you may miss certain moments that aren't necessary to physically complete the
game, yet add depth and richness to Altered Destiny's "story." In other words:
This is a graphic adventure. So be adventurous. Explore everything.

Also remember that in order to complete the game, you will have to guide P.J.
through some scenes more than once - hence, you will find certain scenes
listed below several times. Thus, if you want the "solution" to a particular
scene, be sure to check Part Two thoroughly for all references to that scene.

                             Part Four: Maps & Notes

Before you shout, "Eureka! Maps!" and go flipping like a maniac through the
following pages, heed this warning: While maps do in fact display all of the
"passageways" from scene to scene, they do not indicate places where you must
do something special in order to successfully negotiate a passageway.

In other words: Some passageways in Altered Destiny open only under special
circumstances.

So if a map tells you a passageway exists, but your gameplay won't reveal it,
then it's possible you are missing an important object. Or you have not yet
performed a necessary action. Or something like that. If you're really stuck,
refer to Part Two in this cluebook for ultimate answers.

                                      -34-

NOTE: The maps section of this cluebook has been moved to 10 individual IFF
files that must be viewed outside this cluebook. Sorry about the very poor
quality of these maps, but I hate to draw this kind of map anyway.
