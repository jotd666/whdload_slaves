LICENCE

1. DEFINITIONS

   1. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
      of this Licence.

   2. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

   3. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
      terms of this Licence.

   4. "You" / "Your" refers to an individual or entity exercising rights under
      this Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence
      with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
      Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous violation.

   5. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a compilation or anthology, in
      which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of
      other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
      themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
      a Collective Work is and will be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
      below) for the purposes of this Licence.

   6. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
      other pre-existing works, such as a translation, abridgment, condensation,
      or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed or adapted.


2. FAIR USE RIGHTS

   Nothing in this licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights
   arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive
   rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.


3. LICENCE GRANT

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants
   You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of
   the applicable copyright) licence to exercise the rights in the Work as
   stated below:

   1. to use the Work for its intended purpose;

   2. to reproduce the Work, unmodified, in its entirety;

   3. to distribute, display or otherwise make available copies of the Work,
      unmodified, in its entirety;

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
   or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
   modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
   media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make, distribute,
   display or otherwise make available Derivative Works.

   All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including
   but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4.


4. RESTRICTIONS

   The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
   limited by the following restrictions:

   1. You may distribute, display or otherwise make available the Work only
      under the terms of this Licence, and You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy of the
      Work You distribute, display or make available.

   2. You may not sublicence the Work.

   3. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict
      the terms of this Licence or the recipients' exercise of the rights
      granted hereunder.

   4. You may not distribute, display or otherwise make available the Work with
      any technological or other measures that control access or use of the Work
      in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement.

   5. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
      above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
      commercial advantage or private monetary or other material compensation.

   6. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the
      disclaimer of warranties.

   7. If you distribute, display or otherwise make available the Work, You must
      keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original
      Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilising by
      conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if
      supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer
      to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. Such credit
      may be implemented in any reasonable manner.


5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER

   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
   OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
   ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
   LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
   ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
   TO YOU.


6. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY

   EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
   LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
   BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


7. TERMINATION

   1. This Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence.
      Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
      Licence.

   2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the licence granted here
      is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
      Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
      release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing
      the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
      not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been,
      or is required to be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and
      this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
      as stated above.


8. MISCELLANEOUS

   1. Each time You distribute, display or otherwise make available publically
      the Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a licence to the Work on
      the same terms and conditions as the licence granted to You under this
      Licence.

   2. If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
      the remainder of the terms of this Licence, and without further action
      by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
      the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
      enforceable.

   3. No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no
      reach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
      and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   4. This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
      respect to the Work licenced here. There are no understandings,
      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
      here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
      may appear in any communication from You. This Licence may not be
      modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
