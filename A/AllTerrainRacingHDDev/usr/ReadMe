   This install applies to "All Terrain Racing" (c) 1995 Team 17 - 2 disks.
   Thanks to Denis Lechevalier for sending the original!

   That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path.
   Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.
   To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
   installation mode.

   You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem (+1.3Mb other memory 
   for preload option)
   You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
   Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 Version 1.3 (xx-10-2020) done by JOTD:
 - Second button brakes (issue #) if custom2 is set
 
 Version 1.2 (14-Nov-2013):
 - Fixed uninitialised copperlist which caused weird faults on WinUAE due to
   FMODE being set to -1
 - Source code included

 Version 1.1 (17-Dec-2000):
 - First disk image is now less than half the size, so to preload requires
   500k less memory :)
 - Color bit fix for scandoubler (requested by Pavel Narozny)

 Version 1.0 (02-Dec-2000) done by Codetapper
 - Full load from HD
 - Loads and saves high scores and league races (unless you cheat)
 - Fastest times for each of the courses set to 99.99 seconds so that you
   can have a realistic chance of beating the built in times
 - RomIcon, NewIcon and OS3.5 Colour Icon (created by me!)
 - Trainer (press Del for loads of cash and Help to win a one player race).
   If you cheat, nothing will be saved until you reload the game.
 - Quit option (default key is F10)



CHEAT MODE:
- This cheat was taken from Sweet Cheater by Keith Krellwitz!
  In order to play the later tracks in two-player mode you first have to
  reach them in single-player game.  Then lose a race and enter your name 
  as "ATR".  Now go back to a two-player battle and you can select any of 
  the hidden tracks.

Greetings to Toni for tracing the bug in WinUAE, Denis, Carlo, Chris, Wepl,
all Action members, my testing crew and the WHDLoad team!
