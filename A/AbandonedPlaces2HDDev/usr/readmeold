History:

- v2.0: unprotected version supported (Thanks to Luca for testing)
        rewritten install script

- v1.1: protection enabled again (too many checksums), protection file included
        (only protected version supported ATM)
- v1.0: WHDLoad release, protection removed, doc file included
- v0.x: DOS releases, protection still there

Comments:

* Thanks to Dr Zarkov for hacking bits of my Monkey2 install & my old
  AP2 DOS fix to create a first working version (I missed the savegame
  stuff, and thus I got unexplainable access faults), and for the cool
  install script.

* I don't like RPGs but this one was easy (and interesting) to fix,
  and asked by a cool guy so...

* Use the AP2 file included in install if you previously installed the old
  fix or some features may be disabled (like password protection crack)

Requirements:

 The game requires a installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick343.lha" on aminet.

Thanks to Bert Jahn for writing kickemu.s kickstart interface system.
