CONTROLS
Press 1 or 2 on the title screen to start a one or two player game.

Just like in real skiing, the controls will take a little while to get used
to, but it`s worth it! The LEFT and RIGHT controls refer to the skiers view,
not the camera view, so when you are going downhill pressing LEFT will make
the skier move the RIGHT (It all makes sense when you get used to it). You
may find that if you ski too slowly you will go off the top of the camera
range. You will then have to play by using the radar display on the right.

HOW TO MOVE YOUR SKIER...

PLAYER ONE        ACTION         PLAYER TWO

Joy 1 LEFT        Rotate LEFT    Joy 2 LEFT
Joy 1 RIGHT       Rotate Right   Joy 2 RIGHT
Joy 1 FIRE        FIRE           Joy 2 FIRE

To quit a game, press Q to return to the title screen. Pressing N while on
the title screen will let you enter new name for the players/.

                                 HINTS

Press the FIRE button repeatedly to make the skier pick up speed. If you
hold the FIRE button down while on a slope, your skier will crouch and
therefore go faster.

Yellow bars at the top of the screen tell you how far off the ground your
skier is when he jumps - don`t try to thrust or turn while you`re in the
air; you`ll land awkwardly and crash!
