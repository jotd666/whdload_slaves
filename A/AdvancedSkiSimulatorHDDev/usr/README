 That install applies to "Advanced Ski Simulator" © 1989/1990 Code Masters.

 That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.

 You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 You can quit the game by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with
 Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.0 (08.01.2021) done by JOTD:
 - another version (SPS1805) supported (issue #0004408)
 - music fixed
 - switched from OSEmu to KickEmu
 - install script & readme updated

 version 1.0 (1999) done by Mr Larmer/Wanted Team:
 - protection removed
 - Using OSEmu
 - nice NI/MWB icons included

 Thanx to:
 - Don Adan for original disk image.
 - Christoph Gleisberg for the second version image
 
Notes: the newly supported version (SPS1805, labelled "protec:") has got ridiculous
disk protection, and executable has symbols which makes it very easy
to understand what's going on.
The first supported version (SPS94) has this ridiculous protection TURNED OFF and
replaced by off-the-shelf Rob Northen Copylock executable encryption, which
is way more difficult to defeat (well, not for Mr Larmer :), and CFou! wrote
a generic decrypter in the meanwhile, but I haven't used it here)
