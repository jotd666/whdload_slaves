When you load the game, as soon as the title screen comes up, hit your fire
button.  Choose the language you want (this was only tested in English).
Hit Return whenever it asks you the protection questions.

Now, at the screen where it says:

1)  PLAY THE GAME
2)  SPIDEY TAKE 2
3)  QUIT THE GAME

Using the Joystick,  MOVE THE JOYSTICK DOWN TO SELECTION #2 (Spidey Take 2)
AND CLICK THE BUTTON ONCE (That is a very important step!).  Hit the number
2 key on your keyboard.
You are in the game. Play it as you normaly would, but now, whenever you
start to lose health (indicated by the change in the picture of Spiderman on
the right side of the screen) just hit the HELP key! Suddenly, all your
energy will come back!

End.
