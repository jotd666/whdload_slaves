 This install applies to "Archon 2: Adept" © 1986 Electronic Arts.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 - adapted for WHDLoad 16
 - reworked readme & install script

 version 1.0 (2002) done by JOTD:

 - Game does not need on-board kickstart 1.x to run anymore
 - Convenient install script

 - Instructions included
 - Nice icon by Chris Vella

Notes:

- This one was tough, and time consuming. I hope you'll appreciate it.
- Don't ask me for other early EOA titles such as Archon, Arctic Fox,
  One On One, ... as I'm planning to fix them anyway.
- Tested on A1200/68060, plain A1200/68020, A2000/68030, A4000/060
  If you've got trouble, try setting NOCACHE or/and NOMMU


Thanks go to:

  this would be the same problem, and it was.
- CAPS team for technical advice on the game execution
- Bert Jahn for WHDLoad and KickEmu
- Hidehiko Ogata for original disk image
- LockPick for the floppy crack I had to adapt because it needed the
