 ALIEN BREED LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:
 ---------------------------------
 
 To play ALIEN BREED simply insert disk one and reset you Amiga with the
 conventional CTRL & 2 Amiga Key operation. The Game will load and run 
 after a short period of time. Alternatively you may wish to know the
 background story thats surrounds the game - because we believe a picture
 paints a thousand words we have created a story-disk that we hope will
 get ypou in the right mood for the mission that awaits. To view the
 background story simply insert the story-disk and reset as indicated
 earlier. We believe that having a nice background story/intro is important
 but also realise that you`re unlikely to want to see it every time you play!

 ALIEN BREED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
 --------------------------------
 
 ALIEN BREED requires at least one-meg of memory to operate, it doesn`t 
 matter exactly what typr you have (ie.Chip or Fast) as long as you have 
 one-meg. Altough ALIEN BREED is a one-meg product and most of tha data is 
 loaded initally, there is still a need to load other data when necessary 
 - but this is done between levels and doesn`t detract from gameplay.
 If you have more than one meg of ram then more data is loaded, resulting
 in even faster game-operation.
 
 INTRODUCING THE I.P.C.
 ----------------------
 
 The Inter-Planetary-Corps (IPC) are and elite band of tough mercenaries
 that were assembled by the Planetary Federation to maintain peace and
 order throughout the universe. Their schedule usually consisted of 
 purusing pirates, investigating narcotics-rings and catching sabotuers.
 Teamed in two`s, the IPC were a match for most, if not all of the
 colonists and even most of the outlaws gave them a somewhat grudging 
 respect. IPC members Johnson and Stone were on a rountine journey, 
 Patrolling a relatively quiet part of the intex network cluster in
 the outer spiral arm - after six months on patrol they were heading back
 to IPF-HQ for a well earned break. Their craft, IPCC Miraculous - was a
 compact little machine, highly manouverable but lightly armed - but they 
 weren`t expecting any trouble in the sector of the universe and certainly 
 not on their way home...
 
 INTEX SYSTEMS
 -------------
 
 Intex systems was the name behind many of the technological breakthroughs
 of the period, they were responsible for the huge increase in colonisation
 and most of the complex computer and driod operated stations. Most bases
 have Intex Systems computers available and these offer many services to the
 user including the latest entertainment craze - Space Tennis - amongst
 other things such as new armoury, first-aid-packs, ammo clips etc - which
 are all instantly available through the matter-displacement unit. Intex
 Space Research Centre Number 4 (ISRC-4) Was a such a centre, home to many
 science officers who were working on new security systems, the exact 
 nature of which still remains a closely guarded secret. It seemed odd that
 even the IPC were not told what went on at such stations, all they were 
 given was a vague map of the deck-layout.

 CONTROLLING THE IPC MEMBERS..
 -----------------------------

 Both players are contolled using the joystick, simply move the joystick
 in the direction you wish to go. The joystick button fires off a round of
 ammo using the current weapon, weapons can be bought with collected
 credits at the computer-consoles located around the decks. To activate 
 a console, move towards it and hold the button down. All consoles operation
 is then dont with the joystick and cursor on-screen. The players have a
 finite amount of energy (represented in a energy bar) and this decreases
 as the game commences.
 Energy is lost through battle contact and through drainage using 
 some of the security systems, not to mention things like the acid pools on
 the engineering deck. Energy can be topped up by locating first-aid packs
 scattered around the station or a kit can be ordered from the console.
 You can expect security-device such as the fire-doors(once shut stay shut!),
 one-way energy-doors and suchlike once on board, but because of sercurity
 regulations and restrictions, we are unfortunatly unable to explain any
 further. We do understand that ISRC-4`s host system computer (LNET) is fully
 intact however and this may be able to give some assistance. A small
 portable map of the deck layout can be brought if you have the appropriate
 credits available, this can be operated by pressing "M" on your keyboard
 Pressing "M" again will turn it off!.  The map works better the closer it
 is to an intex console due to magnetic storm activity. When you purchase
 additional weaponry you can select between the currently available ones
 by press the left "ALT" key (Player One) and the righ "ALT" key (player 2)
 Different weapons have different effects and its up to the player to use
 the best weapon in a given situation. You can exit from the computer 
 sub-game by pressing the other joystick button(or left button in one player
 mode).

 GAME MENUS AND OPTIONS
 ----------------------
 
 The game offers several options which are selectable once it is up and
 running. All of these can be toggled using the joystick and fire button.
 These options are as follows: One Player/Two Players (Two joysticks 
 required in 2 player mode)* View High Score Table (Reveals the days top
 ten players)*Share Credits On/Off (in a 2 player game you have the option
 to share any credits you find between the team - otherwise it`s a race
 for cash!)* Start game (play commences with currently selected options).
 The game features a full attract/demo sequence if left alone, Returning
 to the menu afterwards, You can also exit to the main menu by pressing
 ESC.

 TIPS FOR BETTER ENJOYMENT OF THE GAME..
 ---------------------------------------
  
 ALIEN BREED is a great one player game but(like most of the good things
 in life) - is best done with a friend. The two player option is heartily
 recommended and it`s advisable that you both play as a team and cover each 
 other or your survival cannot be guaranteed! ALIEN BREED boats a spectacular
 array of atmosoheric game-sounds and is best played with the volume up!. 
 We recommend that you hook your Amiga up to your Hi-Fi to fully savour
 this aspect of the game.. Now turn down the lights, turn up the sounds
 and encounter ALIEN BREED!.

 TEAM 17`S HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS...
 ----------------------------------

 Our belief when producing ALIEN BREED was to produce a game that wouldn`t
 look (or sound) out of place in a arcade and be the type of game that 
 everyone would want to play and get involved in. We`d like to think that
 we`ve achieved our aims and that you - the player, enjoys the result.

 BACKGROUND IMFORMATION...
 -------------------------

 ALIEN BREED was developed on 2 Amiga 3000`s using ASM-ONE assembler, All
 game graphics are 32 colours and the game runs at 50 frames/second using
 a full Pal display. It uses well over 1.5mb of graphics data (not including
 the story disk), 140k of deck-map data and 210k od digitised sound 
 (74 effects). The source-code is 635k (35.000 lines) and written in 100%
 assembler language - everything has been designed, written and produced
 using the Amiga.

 THE TEAM.
 --------
  
 ALIEN BREED was programmed by the Swedish talents of Andrea Tadic And 
 Peter Tuleby. The art and animation werte courtesy of Rico Holms, Sound
 and music by Allister Brimble with speech effects by Lynetter Reade. Ham 
 story animation created by the one and only Tobias Richter us Reflections.
 Original game design by Rico with jeers and rather infuriating help from
 Martyn Brown, who also was responsible for getting the thing into one
 piece - ie. doing all the shouting,screaming,moaning and sweating.
 
 Thanks are also due to Stefan Boberg for additional programming help and
 copy-protection rountines. We`d also like to thank everyone invloved in
 the project, including all the rather willing games-testers, Mike and
 everyone at EIS, the press for their persistant encouragement, the guys
 n guls in the office and YOU (HYDR0- I HOPE!) for buying, Playing and
 hopefully enjoying the game.

 Thanks also to Stevey babes,Paul,Marcus,Ansy,Kath&Joyce who spent ages
 packing all those full contact boxes, June 91!. Thanks to Dean,Mick Parker
 , Debbie,elaine and Heather for all their encouragement,finally a big 
 thanks to Mick to seeing the whole thing through

 Team 17 have many more exciting Amiga projects in the pipeline, look out
 for them in the press and your local software ratailer. Full Contact
 is also avaiable rrp 9.99 from your local dealer. We`d like to hear from
 players as to what we could have done to make this (and other) titles
 and better. We are making software titles for you first and foremost,
 so its only right that you should have your say!.
