 comment from Mr Larmer on the protection:
 - when I first time seen game code, i thought this is unpatchable. about
   950 decode loops which have 20kb, but for what I have brain ;)

Keys/joypad buttons:
   - Space/second/blue button: enter Intex Computer System
   - M/yellow button: holo-map
   - Alt keys/green button: weapon selection
   - P/play button: pause
   - ESC/fwd+reverse buttons: quit

Original cheat/gametesting keys:
   - F6: level destruct
   - F7: level skip
   - F9: cross walls, all weapons available, no self-destruct timer
   (note that pressing F9 cannot be undone)
   - F1: game over
   - F4: lose life
   - F?: other function keys effects are unknown

notes:

- on WinUAE turn off JIT/use NOCACHE for the game to start
- quitkey works on 68000, but only from inside the game
  (won't work from the menu or the end sequence)

"release notes" (found somewhere I don't remember where):

ZALIEN BREED V1.3, =SB= 14-Oct-91    
Main program code by Andreas Tadic and Peter Tuleby, Graphics and game design 
by Rico Holmes, music and sound effects by Allister Brimble,
 additional programming, bug fixing, copyprotection, data compression routines 
and algorithms, and fastmem sample players by Stefan Boberg

                      == "Funny facts" about this game... 

1) Source code is unreadable and extremely sensitive to changes 
(banana-code at the highest level). 
2) My first protection had to be removed due to the fact that those f***ing 
duplicators couldn't copy it reliably , so this is really not the protection 
I wanted to put in (this one was threwn together in great haste in two days, 
completely from scratch) . For a REAL protection, look forward to PROJECT X 
from Team 17 software, released Jan-92.. It will be tough!  
3) A dozen or so MAJOR bugs were fixed within three days.. we worked 72 hours 
without sleep! I worked even longer after that... I hate the sight of this
 bloody game, sure hope it'll sell well, so I can get some serious cash and
 buy some goodies for me... like a Fusion Forty for my little A3000    
4) The game's gotten rave reviews in all major mags, YAHOO! (six-page review in
 ACE, three pages in CU AMIGA etc..) Good job we payed them all that money! 
(not really...:)    5) After this sentence is finished, this game is 100% finished
, and you cannot possibly imagine how bloody RELIEVED I am.... phew... Over and out...
