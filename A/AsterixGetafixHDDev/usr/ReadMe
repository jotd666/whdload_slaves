 Thanks to Tony Aksnes for original disk image

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.0 (22.05.2020) done by JOTD:
 - fixed blitterwaits that corrupted game code (issue #0003330)
 - french version supported (Le coup du menhir) (issue #0004639)
 - spanish version supported (El golpe del menhir) (issue #0004639)
   now 5 different versions are supported (german, french including cracked, spanish, and 2 english versions)
 - fixed dma sound writes
 - fixed cpu-dependent loops
 - trainer: infinite energy
 - saving took too much time with OS swaps. New installation fixes that. If you have
   an old install, just copy the "asterix.inf" file in your "data" directory if not present.
   (not a big issue if you don't, it's just that the first gamesave will take several minutes)
 - fixed game too fast on fast machines
 - uses fast memory
 
 version 1.3 (24.05.2004)
 - access fault fixed when quitting with ESC

 version 1.2 (09.08.2004)
 - german version supported

 version 1.1 (15.05.2004)
 - another version supported

 version 1.0 (01.05.2004) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - access faults removed
 - color protection removed
 - manual included
 - source code included
 - icons by Exoticon

 Keys:
 - ESC: quits game
 - F10: saves game

Notes:

 - mouse control is sometimes erratic druid/potion part. but it's still pretty playable if mouse is moved slowly
   This is caused by speed regulation. Without speed regulation, that part is too fast, and you can't read the messages.

 - The french cracked version you can find on TOSEC has some stupid infinite loop inserted (probably left from a debug
   session). So loading a saved game locked the machine. Original code restored for that part so the game can be played
   with the cracked version which is pretty common.

 - once again, WinUAE and its various options & logs proved itself invaluable to create a quality slave.
   The game is system friendly except for the audio (which was buggy, then :)), but didn't wait for blitter operations
   to finish (except in 2 locations where it was useless...). So on a 68000 game was OK, but on faster machine, subtle
   blitter errors changed game data, resulting in missing graphics, early exits ...
   The solution was to patch graphics.library system calls so they wait for blitter operation to complete.
   The latest release (2.0) proved VERY time consuming to create a quality fix

 - That, plus cpu-dependent loops, proves that it's not because a game is written in C and uses system calls that it's
   compatible with higher end amigas.
