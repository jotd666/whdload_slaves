                                THE STORY :
 
 Four hundred years ago, to the day, the four heroes Kalynthia defeated and 
 destroyed Bronagh the prince of Evil.  Pendugmahle, the mighty creator of
 Bronagh, has returned to take his revenge upon Kalynthia and its peoples for
 the death of his protege.

 Crossing the planes between the two worlds he has emerged into the dimension 
 in which good defeated evil over four centuries ago.  The people of Kalynthia
 have come complacent in their contentment and their beliefs in the force of 
 evil have diminished.  The revenge of Pendugmahle has been swift, the souls 
 of the people have been sown with the seeds of evil.

 There was an ancient legend of a great order, known as the Ancient Order of
 Arbitrion, lead by a mighty hero named Dowegen.  It was said that the ancient
 heroes of Kalynthia were frozen in a diamonised state only to return when 
 summoned by the Mighty Sword of Life, KUHARK. Which could only be recalled by
 the order of Arbitrion.

 The direct descendants of Dowegen and the leaders of the ancients knew that
 the only hope for the kingdom of Kalynthia was the return of the ancient
 heroes.  After much effort and persuasion the Order of Arbitrion was recon-
 vened in an attempt to recall the Sword of Life.

 From the corners of a dank cellar, a few pairs of dark red glistening eyes
 made up the audience to the few who gathered to form the conjurers circle.
 A deep glow began form the centre of the circle, which soon became a brill-
 iant ball of light from which the great Sword suddenly burst forth.  The 
 ancient order had been drained of life and it has been left up to you to use
 the sword to choose the heroes which you must lead to defeat Pendugmalhe and 
 his minions.

 All menu choices in AP2 are made using the LEFT mouse button.


                               CREATE PARTY

 Before you can start for the first time you must choose your party.  This is
 done by clicking on the CREATE PARTY option.


                            START A NEW GAME   

 After creating your party you can now select START GAME to begin your adven-
 ture.


                            CONTINUE OLD GAME

 The continue old game option is used to reload a previous game position.  
 Click on the option then follow the on screen information.


                            SEE INTRODUCTION

 Before you first play the game you may like to watch the intro for some 
 background information.


                            CHOOSING YOUR PARTY 

 Before starting your quest you must select your party of 4 heroes.

 At the top of the screen there are four boxes containing portraits of your
 current party.  When you click on one of these boxes the party member will
 be placed into the selection box on the left of the screen.

 You can now either choose a different character with the arrows below the 
 box or change the abilities of the selected character are in the display 
 window on the right of the screen.


                            CHARACTER GENERATION 

 The party the character generator starts with is an ideal party for begin-
 ners.  Select the character you want to modify by clicking on the picture at
 the top of the screen.  The portrait will be placed in a small window with 2
 arrows on each side.  If you are not satisfied with the character you can 
 select another character.

 By using the arrows (left for previous character, right for the next charac-
 ter.

 The class and the name of the character are below the picture.  You can 
 modify the name any time by clicking on it.  You must enter at least one 
 letter to continue!  When selecting your characters, you can choose any 
 combination of fighters and mages.  You are not restricted to having 2 figh-
 ters and 2 mages.  However, it is unlikely that you can survive for long with
 a party that does not contain at least one of each type.

 There are 3 types of mage subclasses in the game; each has its own strengths
 and weaknesses.  Your mage subclasses can be seen from your spell points, the
 highest spell points being your subclass.

 You can increase/decrease the character's ability scores by clicking on the
 up/down arrows.  You always modify the ability with the small red arrow next
 to it.  Each character starts with 100 ability points, and each time you 
 modify a character's attributes their points will be updated.  You may notice 
 that setting your ability from 14 to 15 costs more ability points setting 
 your bonuses for a higher ability, and you are penalized for any attribute 
 less than 6.  More details later, in the section 'CHARACTER SHEET.'

 You can not have any score set to 1 and you can't leave the character 
 generation program if any of your characters has such an ability.  You are
 also restricted by having only two of your scores set to 15, as it is the
 highest attribute your characters start with.

 Repeat the above process with all of your characters.  When you are finished
 click on 'exit' to go back to the main menu.

                      \_____________________________/

 The game is fully point 'n' click controlled, with the addition of an 
 'intelligent' pointer system.  That means your pointer will always change its
 form to an icon if it positioned over a special area of the screen.e.g you 
 see a small disk appear if you move over the system menu

 The game display is divided into six sections

 A:play window
 B:select window
 C:action window
 D:movement
 E:compass/system
 F:message window

 
                      AREA A - THE PLAY WINDOW 

 Your play window is where everything from the games world is shown.  It may
 show you:

 1. What you see around; section `3d interface'
 2. Character sheet; section `character sheet'
 3. A town; section `towns'
 4. A shop; section `towns'
 5. The inside of a chest; section `3d interface'


                      AREA B - SELECT WINDOW   

 In the select window you can;

 1. Change the current item ( the pointer ) with any item of youe inventory.

 The inventory screen is a five by five grid where each of your items carried
 by the SELECTED character will be shown.  If you right click anywhere over 
 the gaps between the inventory slots, and your current character is a mage,
 the window will show you you're available spells.

 2. Cast/ready spell.

 If you right click anywhere except on the spell icons the window will change
 to your inventory.  See `spells'

 3. Some system message will appear here.


                      AREA C - THE ACTION WINDOW 

 In the action window you can;

 1. select your current character.

 Left click on the portrait of the character you want to select.  If you are
 not in a touch-spell mode (section `spells') the new character will be sele-
 cted, and it's portrait will have a green border around.

 In touch spell mode the pointer is a blue hand when it is positioned over a
 portrait, and left clicking will cast your spell on that character.

 If a portrait is `ghosted' it means your character is dead!

 Alternatively, you may use the numbers 1-4 for selection, in this case you
 don't have to move the pointer over the action window.

 2. Change order of your characters.

 Right click on a character, the pointer changes into a double headed arrow.

 Right click on another character to change with the previously selected one,
 or cancel this mode by clicking on the same portrait again.

 3. Activate the character sheet.

 This is done by clicking on the bars next to the portraits.  Alternatively,
 you can press the space bar.

 4. View magic/health points.

 The yellow bar is your health, the other 3 are (green, red, blue) cosmos,
 elemental and nucromancy spell points, respectively.  Each bar shows your
 current points compared to the maximum possible. ie 17 of 34 or 200 of 400
 will have the same size.  If you want to know the exact values activate the
 character sheet.

 4. Change the current item (your pointer).

 This can be done to any of the items used by the characters, by left clicking
 on the hand you want your item to be changed.  However, if the selected item
 is still in use (its icon is `ghosted') you can not change it.

 5. Use an item.

 If you right click on the hands of your characters, you will use the item 
 currently held there.  More details in section `items'.

 If you use an empty hand of a fighter you will attack with bare hands, but if
 you use an empty hand of a mage it cast the previously readied spell.  If the
 spell is a touch type spell, the mage will cast it on himself; you don't have
 to select your target.


                      AREA D - MOVING AROUND  

 There are three ways of moving in the game's world, you are free to use which
 ever method you feel most comfortable with.

 1. Clicking on the arrows with your mouse.  

 2. Use the lower half of the numeric keypad (#1-6) or optionlly use the 
 cursor keys for turning and going forward and backward.

 3. In your play window when youre pointer changes its form into an arrow, 
 clicking the right mouse button will follow the movement that the pointer 
 represents.

 
                      AREA E - COMPASS-PAUSE - DISC OPTIONS

 Your compass always shows the direction you are heading.  Sometimes if you
 are teleported to another location in the dungeon that looks the same, or
 your party is spun around, this is the only way you can notice the differe-
 nce, so always key an eye on your compass, especially if you are stuck in a
 level.

 PAUSING THE GAME

 Right click in the compass area with a disk - like pointer will pause the 
 game.

 DISK OPTIONS

 Left click will bring up a menu where you can.

 1. Save your current game - postition.

 2. Quit game, goes back to the main menu, but your game position is lost!

 3. Continue playing.


                      AREA F - MESSAGE WINDOW    

 The message window normally displays anything you should know whilst playing.
 Each message has it's priority and you will only see the ones that are still 
 valid.

 E.G
 If one your characters gains / loses a level, this is a very important
 message, so this message appears instantly in the window replaing anything 
 else.


                        III, CHARACTER SHEET

 The character sheet always shows you these selected characters abilities, 
 scores.

 You can switch between your ability scores and your health/spell points by 
 right clicking anywhere except on the item slots.  

 You may switch back to the display where activated the character sheet, by
 either clicking on the `X' icon or pressing the space bar.

 All the numeric values shown here work in the following way;

 The higher the better 
 If youre score is normal it is shown in grey.
 If youre score is under normal value it is shown in green.
 If youre score is very low or not available it becomes red.
 If youre score is higher than normal (magical) it becomes blue.
 
 a) Name: The characters name.
 b) Class: Either fighter or mage.
 
                              FIGHTER

 A fighter cannot cast spells, but gets bonuses for non-magical attacks.

                               MAGE 

 A mage cannot use most weapons, but excells with magic..  They are the ones
 who heal you're wounded characters, so it is sensible to have at least one
 mage in youre party.  If you want only one mage we advise to start with a 
 necromancer, who can heal wounds in first level.

 The difference amongst the three different mage subclasses is that each class
 gets some spells at different experience levels, and regenerates the spell 
 points from his own sphere (subclass) twice as fast.

 
 A necromancer (necromancy sphere) is strong in healing spells.

 A conjurer (elemental sphere) is good in attacking spells.

 A voider (cosmos sphere) is a mix between the two previous spheres, and he is
 the best in the highest level attack - spells.

 c) Sphere: Your mage's subclass.  None if it is not a mage.

 d) Level: The character's level see `experience'.

 e) Food: Your food level.  If it is 0 your character is starving and will 
 lose health continuously!.

 f) Money: The amount of money your character has.

 g) Exp: Your actuall experience points see `Experience'.

 h) Ability scores: There are penalties for values under 6, bonuses above 13.
 The maximum ability score is 20.

 i) Strenth: How strong your character is.  You will make an additional fix
 damage on a monster if your strength is above 13, but your attack will be
 weakened if your strength is under 6.  If you are carrying to much weigth 
 your attacks will be slower.  A strong character can carry more items before
 it gets penalized.  This is a primary ability for fighters. 

 j) Intelligence: Each time you rise to another level you maximum spells points
 are raised.  An intelligent character can get bonus spell points upto 34 /
 level.  And a less talented one can lose them all.  This is a primary ability
 for mages.

 k) Wisdom: You may have a higher chance to withstand a magical attack.  See
 section `Spells'.  Also your magic points will regenerate faster.

 l) Dexterity: This modify's your basic defence, your attacking speed, and the
 chance of hitting a monster.

 m) Constitution: Adds bonuses and penalties to your maximum health, each time
 you get a new level. Your health points may regenerate faster.

 n) Defence: How easily can you be hit by a monster or a spell.  There is 
 NO maximum defence score !

 o) Health/spell points: The first value is your current status, the second
 is tour maximum score.

 Health: Your character's health.  If it is 0 the character is dead.

 Always track your health and heal your wounded chracters, before it is too
 late.

    Cosmos:     Cosmos    -magic points
    Element:    Elemental -magic points
    Necron:     Necromancy -magic points

 You can equip some items by placing them in specific icon slots around the
 mans outline.   Those items will only be active if they are put there.  ie.
 Carrying armour in your back pack wont stop your enemies attacks.  You must
 put you're armour on!

 There are items with which you cannot not be equiped and some which only 
 appear in there correct positions; In either case a message will be displ-
 ayed.  

 There are items which only help for a specified class.  Always try on an un-
 know item on both mages and fighters and check your ability scores.  Before
 you decide to change an item to something new check all your abilities and 
 try to fight monsters as well.

 Some magoical items are just not as good as they seem to be!!

 
                                IV, ITEMS 

 There are items that work equiped like armour, necklaces, robes etc.  See
 above.  Others must placed into the characters hands and must be used.

 Torches and sheilds must be held in hands, but they are used automatically.

 Some artifacts (greater magical items) have an automatic whose use always
 active PLUS they can have a bonus effect when used!

 While an  item is in - use, its icon is `ghosted'.  You cannot replace that 
 item or use it again, until your hand is free again(he he he)l.

 Each item has a `speed' that modifies how long are they in - use.  Magical 
 items are normally faster than the normal ones.  Some items have a charge
 which tells how many you can use them.  When such an item expires it disap-
 pers from your hand (it shrinks ha haha).  There are items that have great 
 magical powers when held in hands (not again?), but only a few charges for
 spells; ("sexually explicit docs" JOSIE) These items should not be used for
 spell casting except for emergency cases!

 Weapons are melee/short and long ranged.  Melee weapons can only be used  
 successfully with your first two characters in your party - those are the 
 ones standing in front of your foes.  Long range weapons may be used from any-
 where.

 
                             V.  SPELLS      

 A. TO PREPARE SPELL. 
 1. Select the spell level by clicking on the numbers 1-7.  You dont have to 
 select a new level if the shown is the one you require. 

 2. Right click on the spell icon to ready a spell for the selected spell cas-
 ter. 

 B. TO CAST A SPELL. 
 1. Select the spell level.
 2. Left click on the spell icon.  If the icon is ghosted you cant cast that 
 spell.  If an icon is empty your mages level is not high enough to know how
 to cast that spell.  Each spell has its `speed/casting time' as do the weap-
 ons, this is the time you should wait between casting the same spell again.

 Spells cost different amount of magic points from each sphere e.g Healing
 spells take a lot of necromancy points.  Higher level spells are always more
 effective than the lower level ones.

 For some healing spells (touch - spells) you may have to select your target.
 In this case the pointer changes into a blue hand.  Touch - spells can be 
 cancelled by clicking onto any touch - spell again.

 If you attack a monster with magic there is always a chance that it can fail 
 or can't do the amout of damage you expected.  This happens especialy when
 attacking powerful monsters.

 You may find locations in dungeons where your spell points regenerate faster.
 These points are normally well hidden!

 C. MISSILE SPELLS (to attack long distance): 

 Magic missile, meteor storm, sworm, power bolt, globe of air, globe of water,

                      EXPERIENCE                     


 Your experience level depends on the amount of experience points you have.
 The highest exprience level in this game is 20.  High level characters can 
 cast more effective spells, can regain thier health/spells faster, can 
 fight stronger monsters.  You gain experience points for casting spells,
 and successfully attacking monsters.  More powerful your enemy is, the more
 experierance you get,  Some magical items may give you additional 
 experiance.
