ARCADE POOL
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an exciting arcade-style Pool game for 1 to 8 players. It combines
realistic poolhall action, authentic sound effects, offical rules of many
different games, the option to configure your own custom rules and a simple,
yet highly accurate control system to make this the most definitive pool
simulator available.

COMPATIBILTY
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Arcade Pool was designed and written for the AMIGA series of home computers
and as such will run fine on any system. Additionally, Arcade Pool will
detect and make use of the AGA chipset should your machine be suitably 
equipped. The enchancements include better sound and improved ball graphics.

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will need an Amiga computer equipped with 1Meg or More of RAM and a mouse
attached in the appropriate port. This game does NOT use a joystick.

LOADING
~~~~~~~
To load Arcade Pool, simply reset your machine and insert the disk. After a 
while, the Team 17 logo will appear and following that, the game menu and
a demonstration will commence.

During loading, you will be informed of the configuration that the game has
recognised whether you get enchanced graphics and sound and if the game will
utilise a disk cache(memory permitting).

This is an enjoyable tournament for up to 8 players all of whom must aim to
be the last "Survivor"(or alternatively, the "Killer"). Its great fun if 
there are a number of you around and this one will really test players
ability to pot ball under pressure.

ON-SCREEN DISPLAY AND ICONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main game display shows you the table from the direct overhead view. The
shot power indicator is on the bottom right and is tweaked by clicking on the
sliding scale, with a full red line indicating maximum power.

Next to the power indicator is the spin icon. Clicking on this cue ball will
affect how the ball react, so you can apply back, side and top spin onto the 
cue ball to aid you in postioning for you next shots.

If you are playing in EASY mode, the movements of the cue ball after hitting
the target ball will be shown by the dotted line or ball outline.

If you are playing a game where it is vital that that you know the ball
numbers on the spots/stripes ballset, an indicator will be to the left of the
spin icon. If you move the cursor over the ball on the table, its number will
be displayed on the indicator - so make sure you know what you are supposed
to be hitting next by using this very useful icon.

On the left, there are five icons which have the following effects;

         -Exit To Main Menu
         -Reset Table
         -Instant Replay
         -Statistics
         -Save Situation

In the top left corner of the display, to the left of the player name, is the
ball or ball type that the player should be currently aiming for. In the
event of any ball being able to be played, a hybrid ball appears.

MAKING A SHOT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The mouse pointer icon will change to indicate the control options avilable;

     CROSSHAIR GRAPHICS
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Postion the crosshair to aim the cue ball and click the left mouse button
 to confirm.

     BALL MOVEMENT GRAPHIC   
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This means that the balls are in play and no input is possible untill all
  the balls have come to a rest.

     ARROW GRAPHIC
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Use this to select the Power, Spin or Control functions in the lower area
  of the screen.

     HAND GRAPHIC
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The Cue Ball may be picked up and positioned wherever the player wants
  (following a foul).

     CLOCK GRAPHIC    
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  A CPU player is thinking about its shot.

     MOUSE GRAPHIC
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Paused, Click left mouse button to continue.

After postioning your ball with the crosshair and clicking on the left button
a dotted line or ball outline will appear showing the ball`s path.

If you are playing in EASY skill mode, the deflection of the cue-ball after
hitting the target ball we also be shown - this makes it much easier to avoid
accidently potting the cue ball by mistake (called a 'SCRATCH' in the US)

Note: If playing with no aiming aid, you will just see the cross hair.

At this point you can still modify you shot strength and spin by using the
relevant icons at the bottom of the display.

When you are ready to make your shot, press the right mouse button to shoot.
