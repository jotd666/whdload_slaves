 Game requires 2.0MB ChipRAM (+ 2.0MB any memory for PreLoad)

 ECS version has 1 disk
 AGA version has 2 disks

* AGA & CD32 version (done by JOTD):
 
 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200", or kick40068.A4000. 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" or
 "kick40068.A4000.RTB" must be installed in the same directory as the
 kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

Protection Notes: 
It appears that many people with Emulators and Real Amiga's have had
problems from this game for a long time, this is SOLELY because The Company
in a rare form of slackness, didn't crack it properly, hence why all ADF
files are basically junk!

Now, ALL copy protection is removed and Exile plays as it should....

HOW TO TRANSFER MY OLD SAVEDISK?
Put your old savegame floppy in the disk drive.  Get disk2file (it's a
program from the JST package).  Now write this line in CLI:  

        disk2file 0 Disk.2 108 159

It will create the file 'Disk.2' with size 292864 bytes.  Copy it into the
Exile directory.

Thanks to - Adrian Simpson for the disk image
          - Codetapper for fixing OS switch problem with saves!
