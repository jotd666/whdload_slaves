                           THE STORY SO FAR
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After yet another dangerous mission on yet another alien  planet,  you 
lie  back in the commander's seat on the deck of your space-craft  and 
look forward to being warm and comfortable on planet Earth once again. 
In  your heart of hearts you know that one day soon you will  get  the 
calling,  indescridable urge to explore new galaxies,  discovering new 
planets and naming them after your favourite cartoon characters.
But  for  now,  you  tell your commander's seat to  recline  to  near-
horizontal  call up 'Eart Sound Effects - Babbling Brooks IV'  on  the 
ship's hi-fi, close your eyes and think of home.

The   relaxed  harmonious  envirement  of  your  ship   is   suddenly 
interrupted  by a crackling  on the speakers.  The  INCOMING  DISTRESS 
SIGNAL message is  projected onto the main display screen,  along with 
hundreds of seemingly random statistics.  Suddenly the sub-ether comms 
link is activated.....

"This  is Commander Sprake of the Columbus Force Ship Pericles,  on  a 
mission to colonise the planet Phoebus. Here's the data....."

The  screen  in  front of you fills with  even  more  numbers.  You'll 
analyse them later. You think to yourself.

Of course, you know all about the Columbus Force. After all, they gave 
you the training and experience that has kept  you alive so far.  They 
perform  the  most dangerous part of any  colonisation  procedure  the 
initial setting up of a base.  The rewards are immense,  but they work 
with little, if any, back-up.

You  continue  to listen to the disembodied voice extracted  from  the 
ether.

"We're in real trouble down here.  You must help. Not for our sake- we 
may be dead by the time anyone picks this up- but you MUST stop Triax!
Please read this information......"

The  screen  flickers.  It now shows and old news bulletin  about  the 
genetic  engeneer  who was found to be tampering with the  brains  and 
bodies  of helpless victims,  turning them into  ruthless  terminators 
called  himself  TRIAX.  He  was convicted and  sent  into  space  for 
punishment,  destined  to drift helpless in the infinite void for  the 
remainder of his life.  You look at the date of the report. It is over 
a  century  old  - surely Triax should be  long  dead  by  now.  Yours 
thoughts are almost immediately answered by the Commander's voice.

"We  didn't initially realise that anything was wrong,  since  he  had 
hidden himself in the Western system.
Beneath  a  seemingly impenetrable door.  The planet is  riddeld  with 
caves and tunnels,  excavated by an ancient civilisation now  reduced 
to some pitfull imp-like creatures. We set up base in some caves, away 
from the vicious winds on the surface.


"We  dismantled a large section of the Pericles for material  standard 
procedure for colonising a new planet. It seemed for us to do so.
The  worst  things we found were some kind of giant  wasps,  but  they 
usually seem to stay out of the way, near to their nests".

You shudder with reculsion -you have always hated wasps from the first 
time  you regret losing all of your weapons in your last  escape  from 
the Acid Creatures of Ravinox 5.  But you will try to help. After all, 
where would humanity be without having the explorers and colonists  of 
the Columbus Force to satisfy insatiable appetite for expansion?
And  they'd  pay  good  money too - you wouldn't  need  to  sell  your 
valuable  personal transporter if you could rescue the Columbus  Force 
personnel, or avoid their deaths! You listen on intently......


"We  knew  something  was  terribly wrong  when  our  Destinator  went 
missing,  leaving us no choice but stay and explore further.  We found 
that the mysterious western door had opened - the entrance of  Triax's 
domain.  The screams of the doomed exploration party still seem to  be 
echoing  around this hateful place.  they had our plasma gun  and  the 
latest PX312 Blaster Weapon with them, but it did them no good against 
the shear magnitude of Triax's evil creations."


You have heard of the PX312, but have only dreamed of posessing one.
It emits a blast otf energy in directions without effecting the user.
If only you could find it,  and the plasma gun too.  You'd have to get 
through that western door first, though.


"There are terrible creatures down there,  the result of Triax's  vile 
experimentation.  His lab is very deep down.  He is creating a race of 
maggot  creatures  to  infest the universe.  He has  a  giant  machine 
manufacturing them. You must destroy it! He must be stopped! Anyone!
You must come! For pity's sake.....!"

Sprake's  voice,  up to now the unnaturally calm voice of a  condemmed 
man,  seems  to  lose  control.  There  are  confused  noises  in  the 
background,  panicked  voices  intermingled with sporadic icer  shots. 
Sprake  barks out some futile orders in desperation,  then there is  a 
loud  crashing sound,  followed by silence.  You hear the  distinctive 
sound of a Transporter materialisation,  then a new voice, filled with 
evil and malice.


"Finally  I have you,  Sprake.  You and your surviving crew will  make 
fine  fodder for my experiment.  Humans are so much  more  interesting 
than the stupid imps and maggots I've been forced to use for the  last 
hundred years. Come, we will now go to my laboratory."

All thoughts of the warmth and comfort of Earth are now forgotten. You 
are heading for Phoebus......



                              SECURITY SYSTEM
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*** Once you have located the correct code you must enter  it,  either 
by  using the spacemen to hit the corresponding digit on the AMIGA  or 
ATARI ST.

For  example,  if  you  are given the code 4354,  the  two  codes  are 
6167 (OUTER) and 0700 (INNER).

If  you are using a pirated copy of EXILE,  watch out!  The game  will 
modify itself subtly to stop playing as the game progress,  so it  may 
not  be immediately apparent that somtehing is wrong.  You will  enjoy 
playing the game much more if you have bought a genuine copy!

-----------

When the game begins,  you will find yourself in your spacecraft above 
the  planet  Phoebus.   You  see  Triax  materialise  and  steal  your 
Destinator.

Your  ship is helpless without the Destinator - there is no other  way 
of  tracking the sub-space fractures which make  intergalactic  travel 
possible.  The  ultimate  aim  of the game is to  destroy  the  Maggot 
MAchine,  recover your Destinator,  and bring it back to your ship, at 
which  point you will blast away from Phoebus.  You will get  a  large 
bonus  for  each member of the original launch party that  you  rescue 
from captivity in the process.

Before youcan complete the task,  there are many problems to  overcome 
and puzzles to solve. There are often several ways to doing something. 
You  must explore as much as possible,  and you may experiment  freely 
with anything in the environment.  If you find yourself stuck, go back 
and explore - there maybe something that you missed the first time.
You  could  also read this manual again,  since it does  include  many 
helpful hints.



                           GETTING STARTED
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This  section  describes how to complete the first part of  the  game. 
this  may seem unusual,  but it is a insignificant small part  of  the 
whole game,  and it is a good way to painlessly introduce you to  some 
of  the main control methods used in EXILE.  It is not the  definitive 
method of completing this part of the game - you can, for example, get 
more  grenades before going underground.  Feel free to miss out  on  a 
section if you want to explore by yourself.

When  you  arrive at Phoebus,  you will see Triax teleport  into  your 
ship, steals your Destinator and then teleport away again. That is the 
last you will see of the Destinator for a long time!  Without it  your 
spaceship is stranded, so you need to get out and explore.

To  manoeuvre,  you may use either the directional thrust keys or  the 
eight usual joystick directions.

You can see the pair of airlock doors,  but they are locked. To unlock 
the doors,  you need to press the switch near the front of the ship  - 
just bump yourself against it. You may accidentally press the switch a 
seconf time, which will lock the doors again. Once unlocked, the doors 
will  open when you touch them.  So just stand on the top  door,  fall 
through,  wait for the second door to open,  fall through, and you are 
out!  If  you  now  just drop straight down,  you  will  land  on  the 
partially dismantled spacecraft Pericles.

Now  press the REMEMBER TELEPORT POSITION KEY (R).  Nothing  seems  to 
have  happened,  but your teleport circuitry (your "valuable  personal 
transporter") has remembered your position - this will be demonstrated 
later.  Move  to the right,  off the end of the ship,  down  onto  the 
ground, and remember your position again. Watch out for the occasional 
meteorite showers!



Keep  walking east (to the right) and wou will find a irritating  (but 
harmless) bird.  Keep moving,  and you will see a grenade. If you walk 
or fly against it, you will push it along the ground. You need to pick 
it up,  not play football with it!  Hold down the PICK UP KEY (<)  and 
carry  on pushing against the grenade until it jumps into  your  hand. 
Put the grenade into your pocket by pressing the STORE OBJECT key (S).

The bird may knock you around a bit,  but is doesn't actually harm you 
(you  will encounter much nastier birds later on!) However,  you  will 
want to get away from the bird since it hampers you.  You haven't  any 
weapons  yet.  I know you have a grenade,  but you need to  keep  that 
until later and it's a waste using it to blast a harmless bird. So you 
can't  kill it,  you can't grab it (some animals you will be  able  to 
pick  up  and  carry)  and if you fly back to  the  Pericles  it  will 
probably  just  follow you.  Here is where you can use  your  personal 
transporter.....

Lead  the  bird  to the east,  until it can't fly into  the  wind  any 
further,  then press the Teleport key (T). You will be teleported back 
to  the last position you REMEMBERED (on the ground by  the  Pericles, 
well away from the bird).  If you teleport again,  you will end up  at 
the position before that (on top of the Pericles).
So,  teleporting   takes  you  back through  the  positions  you  have 
remembered with the R jey.  Only the last four positions are stored as
the "last resort" position,  which you can always get back to in  case
if dire emergency.  You will also be automatically teleported if  your
health  is  very  low (it never lets you die -  a  valuable  piece  of
equipment  indeed!) - Read the TELEPORTING section of this manual  for
more details.

Now  fly back onto the ground to the east of the  Pericles,  Press  R,
then fly to the left, under the ship.
You  will see a passage down into the ground,  protected by a  defence
gun.  If you are quick,  you will be able to get down the hole without
getting  "killed" (i.e.  teleported back to the surface).  If you  are
killed, you should re-REMEMBER your position (making sure you are in a
surface place), and let your health recover before trying again.

Since the gun takes a while to turn it's barrel to face you,  it might
be a good idea to try approaching from the other direction.

When you get down the hole, move quickly to the left hand of the cave,
out  of  the  sight of the gun.  To the right  you  will  see  another
horizontal door blocking your path down.  It is locked and there is no
switch to open it,  but you can blow open this door with your  grenade
(some doors are stronger than others - this is a weak  one).  REMEMBER
your  position (R) and GET out your grenade (G).  Now fly over to  the
door,  press M to drop the grenade onto the door,  then go back to the
left to shield yourself from the blast.
After a few seconds the grenade will explode,  blasting the way clear.
If  you  are caught in the aftershock you will  "die",  but  the  only
result  of this is that you will be automatically  teleported  (having
REMEMBERED  your  position).  Wait for your  health  to  recover,  re-
REMEMBER your position,  and then carry on down into the depth of  the 
planet. Good luck.....




                             THE CONSOLE
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~

At  the  bottom of the screen,  you will see the console  (or  control 
panel).  This  console  shows  the current status of  all  your  vital 
equipment,  as well as your health,  score and elapsed time.  It  also 
displays important messages throughout the game.

On the far left of the console are the six horizontal Equipment Status 
Indicators.  The  top  indicator  shows the  amount  of  Jetpack  Fuel 
remaining.  The  next  four bars are your  Weapons  Status  Indicators 
(numbered 1 through to 40).  The sixth indicator shows your Space Suit 
protection field status.

On the far right of the console, you will see the six pass-key slots.
As you collect the keys from around the game,  the relevant slots  are 
filled.  If  you are holding a key in your  hands,  the  corresponding 
indicator pulsates.

Below  the  pass-key status area is your Health  Indicator,  shown  in 
white.  This indicator reduces are you get injured,  until finally you 
are so badly hurt that you are automatically teleported away.

In the centre of the console is the EXILE panel. It will begin to glow 
if you are injured,  and also if your jetpack becomes clogged up  with 
mushroom  spores (see later in the manual for more information on  the 
mushrooms).  To  the  right of the EXILE panel is an  indicator  which 
illuminates when your Jetpack Booster is activated.

Below  the EXILE panel you will see your score and underneath that  is 
the  elapsed time panel in the scrolling message area and to the  left 
are the joystick control icons (accessed by pressing the SPACE BAR).



                         THE CONTROL SYSTEMS
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The  following section of this manual describes all the controls  used 
in EXILE.  You have greatest flexibility you use the keyboard, but you 
can  use  a  joystick for thrusting  and  firing,  together  with  the 
keyboard for the extra functions (throwing,  dropping, etc.). At first 
the number of keys available may seem daunting,  but if you persist it 
will soon become second nature.

Note:  -  Due  to a hardware limitation,  the ATARI ST  is  unable  to 
accurately register more than two simultaneous keypresses,  so you may 
experience  a lack of responsiveness if you are trying to press  three 
or more keys together (e.g. thrust up and left, as well as fire).

If you prefer not to use the keyboard at all you can use the  joystick 
for everything (however,  uou always keep the opportunity of using the 
keyboard whenever you like).

The  joystick  control system is icon driven.  You need to  press  the 
SPACE  BAR to get the first icon set,  press it again for  the  second 
set,  then a third time to return to normal thrust control.  Move  the 
joystick to highlight the required icon,  and press the fire button to 
select it.

For  many functions,  you need to keep the fire button held down  when 
you  use the joystick to complete a selection.  When you  release  the 
fire button, the joystick will revert to normal "thrusting" mode.

Note:  - If you have an auto-fire feature on your joystick,  it should 
be turned OFF!


                              THRUSTING
                              ~~~~~~~~~

     FUNCTION:-     KEY:-     JOYSTICK:-

     Left           Q         Push Left
     Right          W         Push Right
     Up             P         Push Up
     Down           L         Push Down

Thrusting  causes  a  pressurised jet of air (or  water,  if  you  are 
underwater) to be blasted from your jetpack.
You  will  see this jet as a stream of  particles.  The  Jetpack  uses 
energy - its energy bar on the console shows how much energy  remains. 
If  you are standing on the ground,  thrusting sideways causes you  to 
walk or run,  using no energy.  If you thrust up while standing on the 
ground, you get an extra upward impulse by jumping. If your Jetpack is 
out of fuel,  or temporarily blocked (e.g.  with mushroom spores), you 
can still run and jump.



                          AIMING AND FIRING

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Once you have found,  pick it up,  and selected a weapon you can  then 
fire it. It is fired in the direction you have chosen using the aiming 
controls  (see below).  Additionally,  the fire key/button can  affect 
some held objects - for example, if you are holding a grenade, you can 
use it to start and stop the countdown to detonation.

Holding down the fire key/button gives auto-fire on the missiles,  but 
you can fire more rapidly by repeatedly pressing it quickly yourself.


NOTE:  If you are using the joystick for thrusting,  the SPACE BAR  is 
used  for  icon  selection,  but if you are  using  the  keyboard  for 
thrusting, the SPACE BAR functions is the FIRE KEY.

The  Aiming function controls the trajectory of firing  and  throwing. 
You can raise and lower the direction (a stream of particles shows the 
direction  of aim as you do this),  and by holding the RAISE  AIM  and 
LOWER  AIM keys together,  you can show the current  aiming  direction 
without altering it.

To  aim using the joystick,  select the icon and keep the fire  button 
held  down.  You will see a stream of particles showing  your  current 
aiming  direction.  Move  the joystick up and down to  direct  it,  or 
sideways  to  centralise it.  When you release the  button,  you  will 
return to normal thrusting mode.


To pick up an object,  you must hold the PICK UP key as you touch  the 
object in front of you by moving into it. You may also be able to grab 
an object that is on your head,  or under your feet,  as long as it is 
not actually behind you. To use the joystick, select the PICK UP ICON, 
and  keep  the  fire button held dwon while  you  thrust  against  the 
object, until you have succeeded in picking it up.

Not  all objects can be held,  and some objects will hurt you if  they 
are  carried (e.g.  radioactive crystals - until you  gain  radiactive 
immunity).  On  the  other hand,  some creatures  can  be  held,  thus 
stopping them hurting you (try grabbing a wasp).


             * Try picking up the big fish.........


Once you are holding something, you can drop or throw it. Pressing the 
THROW key launches the object in the direction defined by your  aiming 
trajectory. Realistically, light objects are thrown further than heavy 
ones.  Also,  thrusting  and walking are slower if you are carrying  a 
heavy object.

If  you  select the THROW or DROP icon with the  joystick,  you  won't 
actually  throw or drop the object until you release the fire  button. 
This  enables you to manoeuvre whilst you drop or throw.  This can  be 
very important,  because you can throw objects faster by thrusting and 
throwing at the same time.




                            USE OF POCKETS
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+--------------------------+  +--------------------------+

You have four pockets into which you can store some carried objects.
The  pockets  are actually stasis fields,  desgined so that  a  stored 
opject is completely suspended in time and space (a live grenade won't 
explode, for example) and doesn't affect your weight.

Pressing  the STORE OBJECT key,  or selecting the STORE  OBJECT  icon, 
will  put the object you are holding into a pocket.  If  this  doesn't 
work it either means the object is too large,  or all your pockets are 
occupied.  If  it is the latter,  you can still use GET OBJECT to  see 
which item(s) you might want to discard.

Pressing  the GET OBJECT key will take an object out of  your  pockets 
and put it into your hands.  If you are already holding something, the 
held  object will (if possible) be put in a pocket  first.  Repeatedly 
pressing the G key will cycle through all the items in your pockets.


Selecting the GET OBJECT icon with the joystick is similar to pressing 
the G key,  except that if you keep the fire button held down you  can 
cycle  through  the items in your pockets by moving  the  joystick  up 
(just like repeatedly pressing the G key), or you can store the object 
away (like pressing S) by moving the joystick down.  Release the  fire 
button to return to normal thrusting mode.




                             TELEPORTING
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~

You will quickly find out the importance of your personal  teleporting 
capability, and it is imperative that you learn to use it properly and 
get the best out of it.

When you teleport,  you go to the last position stored with  REMEMBER. 
This position is then lost,  so the next teleport will take you to the 
position remembered before that.  You will usually want to re-REMEMBER 
your position immediately after you have teleported,  in order to keep 
this position intact as your destination.

Your teleport circuitry remembers only the last four positions, plus a 
"last resort" position, back at the ship.

You  can  teleport  voluntarily  (by pressing  the  TELEPORT  KEY)  or 
automatically  (when  you are badly injured,  in which case  you  lose 
points).  Because  of this,  it is a good idea to only  remember  your 
position   in   places  which  are  SAFE.   If  you   are   teleported 
automatically,  you will want to recover without something immediately 
hurting you, and causing you to teleport again.

You cannot teleport voluntarily if you are holding something,  and  if 
you  are  teleported  automatically you will  drop  whatever  you  are 
currently holding in your hands.  You may even have something drop out 
of your pockets, so try and teleport voluntarily before this situation 
occurs.  If you arrive at your destination very hurt,  there will be a 
short delay (a couple of seconds) before you are able to remember your 
position again. Listen for the sound effect when you press R.

You can use your teleport strategically too. For instance, to get past 
a  creature  that  keeps pushing you away,  you  could  REMEMBER  your 
teleport position,  be pushed back, then TELEPORT. You will then be on 
the other side of the creature!

Certain  weapons  and  items  (listed below)  that  you  pick  up  are 
automatically attached to your spacesuit, and cannot be dropped again. 
Initially  you  have only your jetpack (not to be  confused  with  the 
jetpack booster). These items use energy from their own batteries, but 
energy  can be freely transferred between them.  You can see  how  the 
energy  is distributed by looking at the energy bars on  the  console. 
The  weapon selection and charging functions have no effect until  you 
have picked up your first weapon,  and when you have picked it up  you 
must remember to select it before you can fire it.


                      KEYBOARD WEAPON SELECTION
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To  select  a  particular piece of equipment you  need  to  press  the 
relevant  key.  You  can  transfer energy to the  selected  weapon  by 
pressing  SHIFT together with the key corresponding to the  item  from 
which you want energy to be taken.  For example,  if you have Weapon 1 
selected,  you can transfer energy to it from the jetpack by  pressing 
SHIFT  together  with  the  jetpack  key.  You  will  see  the  energy 
transferred on the console.  If you need to recharge your jetpack from 
a weapon,  you need to select the jetpack first,  and then press SHIFT 
together with the weapon key.


                      JOYSTICK WEAPON SELECTION
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly,  select  the WEAPON icon (Icon set 1,  centre left icon)  and 
keep  the  fire button held down.  You can now choose your  weapon  by 
moving  the  joystick left and right or you can  charge/discharge  the 
weapon by moving the joystick up and down.
Release the fire button to return to normal thrust mode.

When  a  weapon  (or the jetpack) is low on energy  it  will  function 
intermittently. To gain extra energy, you need to pick up Power Pods.
These are released when robots or gun turrets are destroyed,  and they 
supply  energy to the jetpack battery (from which you can  charge  the 
other items).  Power pods become unstable and begin to pulsate if they 
are  disturbed,  so you should pick them up quickly before they  burst 
into flame and self-destruct.


                               THE GUN
                               ~~~~~~~

This is the first weapon you will find, and fits into slot 1. It fires 
bullets which cause damage on impact and are quite light.  It is quite 
a feeble weapon,  but capable (with lots of shots) of stunning  robots 
and turrets temporarily.


                               THE ICER
                               ~~~~~~~~

This  fits into slot 2,  and fires explosive energy packets  which  do 
more damage than bullets.  Not surprisingly,  it uses more energy than 
the gun.  It is carried by a hovering robot, which you need to destroy 
to get the Icer.


                          THE PX312 BLASTER
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This  weapon  (slot3) causes a blast of energy away  from  your  suit, 
damaging and pushing away anything that is close to you. It uses a lot 
of energy though. Just watch the energy drain away as you use it!


                            THE PLASMA GUN
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The  weapon  in slot 4 launches plasma balls (very hot  charged  gas), 
using about 10 times the energy of the gun.


                        THE PROTECTION DEVICE
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This  item gives you greater protection from anything that hurts  you. 
In  doing so it uses up enrgy,  and when it is low in energy  it  will 
lose  its effectiveness,  so you will revert to your normal  strength. 
Watch  the console to see when it needs recharging.  The more you  are 
being hurt,  the more quickly energy will be used in trying to protect 
you.


                            SCREEN OFFSET
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To  enable you to see more of your surrounding  environment,  you  can 
move  the  screen  by using the cursor control  (arrow)  keys,  or  by 
selecting  the  screen offset icon and moving the joystick  (with  the 
fire button held down).

Pressing  the left and right cursor keys together will centralise  the 
screen   horizontally.   Pressing  the  up  and  down  keys   together 
centralises the screen vertically.



                                BOOST
                                ~~~~~

These  functions  are  only applicable once you  have  picked  up  the 
jetpack booster attachment.  The  booster gives you the capability  of 
doubling the amount of thrust from your jetpack, although it uses four 
times the amount power in the process (you can see it's status on  the 
console).  Once installed, you can switch it on or off as required and 
you  can also activate it for short bursts of energy.  The booster  is 
particilarly useful (if not essential) when you are trying to carry  a 
heavy object.


                               WHISTLES
                               ~~~~~~~~

There are two whistles to find an pick up.
They  are  needed  to control the  fiendly  robot  "Chatter",  who  is 
initially deactivated.  When you are able to, try feeding Chatter some 
Coronium crystals, and then using the whistle.


                               LIE DOWN
                               ~~~~~~~~

This option forces you to lie down on the ground - useful for  getting 
through small gaps,  or ducking enemy fire. To stand up again, release 
the key or joystick fire button.


                             TURN AROUND
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~

This  option  makes the spaceman turn around to face in  the  opposite 
direction. IF he is lying down, he will turn to face upwards.


                         REPEAT LAST MESSAGE
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You  will occasionally see messages scrolling along the bottom of  the 
console.  They are usually initiated when you touch something for  the 
first  time,  telling you what it is.  Sometimes there is a  queue  of 
pending  messages waiting for you.  This option will repeat  the  last 
message for you.



                                 MENU
                                 ~~~~

The menu screen gives you the option of loading and saving  positions. 
This is described in detail later on in this manual.


                              PAUSE GAME
                              ~~~~~~~~~~

There is no visual indicator to show that the game has been paused, so 
if the game seems to have "frozen", try pressing this key!


                               SCORING
                               ~~~~~~~
To  the left of the EXILE logo on the console is your  current  score. 
You  gain  points for killing enemy creatures,  and  you  also  scores 
bonuses  for  completing certain tasks,  such  as  destroying  Triax's 
Maggot MAchine,  and rescuing crew members.  If you are injured enough 
to be automatically teleported, you will lose points.

Also displayed on the console is the elapsed time.  This is the actual 
playing time taken to reach this point in the game. You lose one point 
per second from your score,  so it doesn't pay to hang around for  too 
long doing nothing!


**********************************************************************

                       SOME THINGS YOU WILL SEE
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--DOORS--
There  are  doors  to be found throughout  the  game,  hindering  your 
progress.  An unlocked door is easy to pass through - all you have  to 
do is to touch it and it will open.  If a door is locked, however, you 
will need to either find a way to unlocking it,  or you may be able to 
blast it open with a grenade (there is only one type of door that  can 
be blasted in this way).

You can lock or unlock a door by using the RCD (see below),  but  only 
if  you possess the key corresponding to that  door.  Sometimes  there 
will be a switch that controls a door,  or there might be an invisible 
trigger-point  nearby which activates its mechanism.  Different  doors 
have different strengths - weak doors can be destroyed with a grenade, 
for  instance,  while the other doors require either the Cannon  or  a 
Coronium blast to destroy them.  Ancient rock-doors cannot be affected 
by the RCD, even if you have all the keys.



                          TURRETS AND ROBOTS
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are easy to spot,  since they shoot at you at every opportunity! 
If you manage to damage a robot or turret badly enough,  it will start 
flashing, indicating that it's "Stunned". This puts it temporarily out 
of  action.  If  your weapon is strong enough you should  be  able  to 
destroy  it completely wit a few more quick shots.  It may  release  a 
power pack, or maybe something more useful when it expires.


                                 IMPS
                                 ~~~~
Imps  evolved  from  the remnants of the  ancient  civilisation  which 
originally built the underground system of Phoebus.  They are not very 
friendly - they bite you and throwing mushrooms or other things at you 
given half a chance.  However,  if you give an imp something it  likes 
(or  even if it steals something) it may give you something useful  in 
return.


                     SWITCHES AND TRIGGER POINTS
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You have already encountered a switch in your spaceship.  Switches can 
lock  and  unlock doors,  open and close  doors,  enable  and  disable 
transporters, and even change transporters destinations.

You may be walking or flying through what seems an empty tunnel,  then 
suddenly there is a sparkling effect,  and a door opens or closes. You 
have encountered an invisible trigger-point.  You can sometimes  leave 
an object in the trigger area to keep the effect going (e.g. keeping a 
door open).


                             TRANSPORTERS
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~
Transporters  are teleport booths.  Any object that touches the  scan-
beam  gets transported to the location programmed into it.  The  scan-
beam stops if the transporter is deavtivated -either with a switch, or 
the RCD (if you have the correct key).


                               GRENADES
                               ~~~~~~~~
When a grenade is thrown or dropped,  it will become "live", exploding 
a few seconds after the countdown begins.  You can start the countdown 
without dropping the grenade by pressing the FIRE key.
Press it again to stop the countdown. If you are quick, you can grab a 
live grenade,  press the FIRE KEY to deactivate it,  and then keep  it 
for your own use.



                   THE REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE (RCD)
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  RCD  is a vital piece of equipment that you need  to  locate  and 
recover.  It  was dropped by a member of the Pericles down  through  a 
trap  door,  into  a fire.  It is used to lock and  unlock  doors,  or 
activate and deactivate some transporters.

To use it,  aim it at the centre of the door or transporter (using the 
AIM keys),  and press the FIRE key.  You will hear a sound and see  it 
emit a particle stream,  showing that it is functioning. Each door and 
transporter  has  its own activationcode,  witch means  you  need  the 
correct pass-key in order for the RCD to have any effect.  You must be 
close enough for this to work,  and the further you are away the  more 
you care you need to take to aim it (just like old-fashioned TV remote 
controls found on earth).  There are two pass-keys which you can  find 
in the early stages of the game.

If  you  use  the RCD on a door or transporter,  or touch  a  door  or 
transporter  beam,  the corresponding pass-key slot will flash in  the 
console. If you don't already posess it, this shows which pass-key (if 
any) will control that door or transporter.



                            THE CANNON RCD
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There  is a second RCD which operates similarly to the  first,  except 
that  this one fires the cannon (no pass-key is required).  AIM it  at 
the Cannon, then press FIRE. Watch out for the blast!


                                FLUFFY
                                ~~~~~~
Originally  a pet of one of the colonists,  Fluffy is a strange  alien 
creature  who has a tendency to squeak repeatedly when  frightened  by 
loud noises such as gunfire.  Once he's befriended you, he'll stick by 
your side through thick and thin.  Fluffy is extrememly agile, and can 
squeeze through very tight gaps to retreive objects for you....



                              MUSHROOMS
                              ~~~~~~~~~
Mushrooms  on  Phoebus  are  really  annoying,   since  their   spores 
temporarilly block up your jetpack.
There are two types of mushrooms.  Some are of a hallucinatory nature, 
making  you fall over helplessly when you are affected  by  them.  The 
others  just block your jetpack - you can walk through areas of  these 
mushrooms.  After  a  while your jetpack  will  automatically  unblock 
itself.

You can eventually protect yourself from these effects by finding  and 
storing away a special immunity filter. Even without immunity, you can 
still  PICK  UP  and STORE AWAY mushrooms,  since  they  don't  always 
disintegrate on impact.

Whilst you are suffering from the effects of the mushrooms,  the EXILE 
logo on the console flashes green.




                               CORONIUM
                               ~~~~~~~~
Coronium  is  a glowing,  radio-active  substance.  There  are  small, 
unstable Coronium crystals, and large Coronium rocks. Touching any two 
of  these together causes an explosion,  the most powerfull  explosion 
being  when two Coronium rocks collide.  You can manufacture  Coronium 
crystals by burning the Mushrooms.

Initially you get badly hurt if you touch Coronium, but eventually you 
will find a radiation protection pill which stops this happening.  You 
will  need  to get a Coronium rock from the Eastern tunnel  system  to 
blow open the entrance to the Western tunnel system.

HINT: There is a two-stage method of converting "Slimes" into Coronium 
ROcks.



                            SUCKING CLAMS
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are GIANT clams scattered around the lower regions of the tunnel 
system.  Each  clam  can generate a  powerfull  force,  attracting  or 
repelling  anything  in its sight (including  you!).  Some  are  fussy 
eaters, and only suck when they see their particular food.



                         USING GUNS AS TOOLS
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Everything in EXILE has mass,  varying from light wasps to large heavy 
boulders.  Winds  have less effect on heavy objects than  light  ones. 
Conservation of momentum applies on all impacts, so that a fast, light 
object  may move something as much as a slow,  heavy one.  Because  of 
this, you can use your guns as tools to move heavy objects around. The 
second  gun (The ICER) has heavier projectiles than the first,  so  it 
will move things more effectively.  Note,  however,  that this uses up 
energy very quickly.

Most pieces of equipment you will find (keys,  RCDs,  Guns,  Whistles, 
the  Cannon,  the Booster,  the Protection Suit,  the Destinator)  are 
indestructable, so don't be afraid of damaging them.
Feel free to shoot at them or blow them up in order to move them.

If you are trying to move something heavy along the ground,  it  helps 
to  aim slightly upwards as you shoot.  This tends to lift the  object 
off the ground, thus reducing friction. Aiming straight upwards as you 
shoot is an effective way of lifting something up into the air.



                     SAVING AND LOADING POSITIONS
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When  you enter the menu screen (by pressing HELP) you are  given  the 
option of loading/saving to DISK,  or loading/saving to RAM.  Use  the 
joystick  and fire button or the cursor keys and RETURN to select  the 
required option. Select CONTINUE to return to the game.

Saving a position to RAM is very useful during gameplay,  since it  it 
is  a  good  idea  to temporarily save  your  position  before  trying 
something dangerous or tricky. Imply select RAM SAVE or RAM LOAD.

To save your position to disk you must have a blank, formatted disk to 
use as your EXILE data disk.
You must REMOVE YOUR GAME DISK, place your blank disk, or a previously 
initialised EXILE data disk into drive A and select DISK SAVE.  If the 
disk  hasn't been initialised as an EXILE disk,  you will be asked  if 
you want this disk initialised. Once the disk has been initialised, it 
should only be used as an EXILE data disk. You will not be able to use 
the disk other than from within EXILE.

When the disk has been initialised, you should choose one of the slots 
into which you want to save the position. Do this by either the slot's 
identification letter,  or use the cursor keys and Return,  or use the 
joystick  and fire button.  You can then type in a name,  followed  by 
Return,  and  the  position will be saved.  Pressing Esc  during  this 
process will cancel the operation.

To load a position from disk,  place the EXILE data disk into drive A: 
select  DISK  LOAD choose the required slot (as described  above)  and 
press Return.
