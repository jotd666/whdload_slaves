 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly

 - Selfmodifying code fixed
 - Protection removed

 - Return to OS (Numl)


NOTES:

* The imager asks you for 2 disks, in fact, leave the only disk in the drive (or for IPF file users
just press "Start" again). The reason for this is that v1.0 install used 2 disk images for 1 disk,
and the simplest way to make this happen with RawDIC was to ask for 2 disks.

* up to version 2.0 only version SPS1572 was supported, and imager created disk images which can be
truncated (no data on those tracks, other SPS versions don't have those tracks). If you want to shorten
the diskfiles, just reinstall. Else leave it be.

CHEAT:

When you get the prompt to enter your code, type in SUZANNE (on old versions it was SARA) and then return.
Now, anytime you wish, you can enter the hidden modification program and edit your ship and cargo!
To enter this program, hit the HELP key or the * key on the keypad.
To exit, hit the ESC key.
When you enter, you will be asked for the byte you wish to change, and then you will be asked for the replacement
value, below is a chart to help you become elite:

Note: you have to set CUSTOM1=1 to enable this feature, or protection will be completely skipped
