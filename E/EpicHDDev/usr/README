	That install applies to "Epic" and "Epic mission disk" © 1992 Ocean.

	The mission disk will only work together with the standard version
	of "Epic".


	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=")


	Highscores are saved to HD.


	ATTENTION! The mission code "CEPHEUS" (mission 3) will
	crash the game. This was also a problem of both disk
	versions i have seen (HD version is ok!)
	I have not found the reason for this yet, however, all
	other codes work fine.

	To get the code for mission 4 you'll have to finish
	both, mission 2 and 3 without dying, but as these
	missions are damn easy, i assume everybody should be
	able to do so.

	The "CUSTOM1" tooltype is used as a switch for starting
	the standard or mission disk game.

    On the hard disk installable version, the "CEPHEUS" mission
	code works properly. The "mission disk" isn't supported here.
	
Version 2.0 (31.10.2022) done by JOTD:

- enabled caches for better speed (issue #0002560)
- enabled real fastmem for better speed (issue #0001414)
- support for the HD installed version with more animations (SPS1820)
- reduced chipmem requirements to 512k (for version SPS1819)
- soundtracker sound timing fixed
- supports another version (3 disk installable, issue #0005708)
- document protection removed in HD installable version
- relocated copperlists & sounds in chipmem in HD installable
  version so code can run in fastmem
- added manual & solution

Version 1.x done by Wepl

- previous releases, run in chipmem only, only supports non-HD versions.

Note: the HD installed version (SPS1820) uses a different slave with 1MB chip, so
music plays in the intro. If you want to use that version but only have 512k chip,
you can replace the slave with the other slave (for diskimage version). The only drawbacks willbe:

- no music in the first part of the intro (credits)
- useless "select mission disk" option in whdload splash screen
- message saying that password crashes the game while actually it doesn't.
