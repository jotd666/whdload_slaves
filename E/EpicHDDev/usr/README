	That install applies to "Epic" and "Epic mission disk" © 1992 Ocean.

	The mission disk will only work together with the standard version
	of "Epic".


	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.


	You need 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=")


	Highscores are saved to HD.


	ATTENTION! The mission code "CEPHEUS" (mission 3) will
	crash the game. This was also a problem of both disk
	versions i have seen.
	I have not found the reason for this yet, however, all
	other codes work fine.

	To get the code for mission 4 you'll have to finish
	both, mission 2 and 3 without dying, but as these
	missions are damn easy, i assume everybody should be
	able to do so.


	The "CUSTOM1" tooltype is used as a switch for starting
	the standard or mission disk game.
