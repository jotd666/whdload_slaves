The sun set over Damiran in a haze of pink and purple.
It cast an eldritch gealm on the leghtening shadows of
the forest,seeming to evelop the land in somethink that
could only contain peace and harmony.

The may once upon a time have been true, but even long
before the memories of the most ancient elders begun it
had been enchanted by an Evil Power of formidably dimen-
sions - at that time,peace and harmony had probably al-
together disappeared from the land a Troll would from
sun.

Ever since that time, now and again a Damiranian would
escape to the neighbouring countries, bringing with him
wild tales and ill tidings of Evil,Black Magic and chaos
;tales of an Evil Sorcerer - who had destroyed the lands
Heard of Lore.

Old Scritures spke of Damirans Heart of lore ad its
main source of prosperity, law and order.It had kept
ill away from the land , and had endeed been of major
infuence on the well-being of all the people who had
dwelled there. Damiran's monarchs of old had been an
invalueable treasure whixhindeed it had.

Yet in Lumthorn, a forest on one of the outer edges
of the land,a sorcerer called plogther had lived who
wasn`t content with anythink.He had noticed that peo-
ple didn`t come to him any more when they had needed
something magical do be done -they had rather visited
the king who wielded the heart of lore instead.In his
forest hut , he had concocted evil plans and dark pa-
tions that he wanted to use to render Damiran`s Heart
of lore useless forever.

If had been dark day in the history of Domiran when
the sorcerer arrived at the gates of Traskor, the
lands capital behind him, a large box wrapped in
black had floated on what must have been an invisi-
ble field of power.A sense of doom had radiated from
his eyes when he had ordered the guards to escort him
to the king`s castle.

The inhabitants of the city had looked at plogthor
with awe as he strode by wearing his omninous dark
blue robe.They had whispered among each other , not
even daring to point at his mysterous black box.

When the sorcerer and his escort had arrived at the
castle,the drawbridge had been lowered - upon which
plogthor, followed by his mysterous floating box had
entered.

The night, a hohue explosion had shuddered the city
of Traskor.Fire had burst forth from the kings cas-
tle and had vicously hurled bolts of white lightning
into the night sky which it had seemed to tear appart
in a tremendously huge cacophony of thunderous roars
and blackest of fumes.

Nobody had known much of what had happened that dark
night, but it had been the start of a bad epoch for
Damiran.The heart of lore,so it tuned out later, had
been destroyed and it`s magical potency had diffused
over all the land in countless fragments, impossible
to begain and assemble bac into what had once been
Damiran`s main source of prosperity, law and order.


   OR HAD IT ?????
   ---------------

The most ancient of elders had looked ghostly in
the light of the candles and the odd torch that had
shone upon the lined image of his face. An eerie si-
lence had filled the room as he had opened his eyes
and had prepared to speak.

We are gathered here tonight to send forth a mission
of help,"he had spoken with a voice that had seemed
to be worn with centuries of sorrow and grief,"a mis-
sion of help to our neightbouring country,Damiran."

He had looked around him,and his gaze had settled on
an older wizard by the name of kurgan.

As if he had sensed the gaze, Kurgan had looked up
without speaking,swollowing somethink.

The most ancient of elders had contiued."To many peo-
ple suffer the acid reign of Plogther, known to us as
despiser, and it is our sworn duty to help the Dami-
ranians to get rid of the Yoke which now rests heavy
upon their wtithing shoulders.

A low mutter of agreement passed though the ranks of
the other elders present in the room.

"i have selected kurgan our wiest and most expenced
wizard, to regain the parts of Damiran`s heart of
lore.Only the gods know if he will succed in fulfil-
ling this formmidable task.Only he can bend the fate
of Damiran`s doom.

Kurgan had looked up, proud of the fact that the most
acient of elders had considered him worthy of this
mission.

  AND NOW THE TIME HAD COME !!!

He looked at the setting sun and felt a peculiar kind
of nausea shatter a feeling of what might have been
joy at the beholding of such a beautiful sight.

For a moment, he hesitated.

Without looking back, he crossed the border to
