 This install applies to "Earl Weaver Baseball" © 1986-1987 Electronic Arts

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

notes:

This install was started in 2005, but was running too fast.
It also used disk images. My recent successes in fixing speed of a
lot of games made me retry that one, and it seems to run at proper speed now.

The commissioner disk editor is also supported. It seems to be a system friendly game but
programmers just forgot to wait for blitter operation end when filling rectangles, which resulted
in slightly trashed graphics (never leave trashed graphics!).
Commissioner program can't use fast memory as there seem to be some 32 bit incompatibilities.
We'll leave that fix for later. Not super-crucial.

I didn't test all features, like load/save. There may be some limitations. Please report them
using Mantis with the full reproduction scenario

If someone knows how to quit current game/practice mode, I'd like to know...
