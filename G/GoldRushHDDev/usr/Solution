Well if you are having any trouble with Gold Rush this should help you out. 
we have also included the Docs to this game incase you have use for them.
                         -Maligzar

Now the story. You start out in Brooklyn.  The first thing you do is type
"Sell house".  After typing this you must immediatly go and enter your house.
Once you get in your house you must look at the photo album and get the 
pictures from it.  Then you must go over to the desk and close it.  Get the
bank statement and look at the bank statement. You will recieve points for
this. After this leave your house, go to the park and get a flower.  Be sure
not to walk on the grass because this will cost you points.  The proceed to 
the Guzzebo(close enough)and look in the cracks. You will then discover a 
gold coin.  Be sure to get this item for it is necessary to obtain it to
win.  Then go back to your house and wait untill you see a man holding some
green money.  Talk to him and he will give you money for your house.  After
getting the money go to the post office and ring the bell. When the mailman 
comes ask for mail.  Then get the letter and open it.  Read the postmark 
and get the stamp.  Then read the letter.  After doin this proceed to the 
bank and withdraw your money.  THe account number is written on the bank
statement.  Go then and go to the stagecoach ticket office.  Buy a ticket
there. This will take you there BY WAGON!!!(Not by Boat)After you buy the
ticket go to the graveyard. Proceed to the second grave and look at your 
parents graves and drop the flowers there.  Then go to your bosses office.
Go upstairs and look at the clippings. Then go down stairs and quit your
job.  Then go to the livery shop and talk to the man in there. Be sure
not to get kicked by the horse fo this will cost you your life.  Then
show that man your ticket and get on the wagon. And your on your way to
Cali!!!
       -Maligzar


Ok the stage coach will bring you to a ferry, and the ferry will take you to
New York from this place you will go to Mississippi Valley. Here you go and
talk to a group of men and one of these men he will ask for money be sure
to give him all of your money.. He will also send you to get good animals to
pull the wagons. From here go right and talk to a man who is sitting by a
tree reading a book he will give you the book(Bible). From here you go left 
then down. Talk to the man there and ask to buy mature oxen. Then go back to
your camp and talk to captain again and he will give you another assignment.
The assugnment is to find out when to take off or leave. Go right from here 
then go up adn look at the grass it will give you a report on how the season
grass is looking. Once it says it is drying out go talk to your captain 
and you will leave from there.


Once you are on your way to California you will travel for a while through a
few states it wil give you general info about them. Once you get somewhere
near California you will be stopped at a hill. You will be shown outside your
wagon. You will have to quickly tie the chains. Then you must untie the oxen.
They will go down the hill then return back up. You are now on your way again
and wont be stopped until you hit a desert. Here you must look in barrel and
drink the water from it. Then you must look inside the wagon and eat the meat.
Be sure to go right from here and catch your men. You will soon be at Fort
Sutter...
                       -Maniac

Once you reach Fort Sutter you must eneter it.  Not the Mule Corral.  Once in 
here you must find the supplie shop. You must buy a shovel. Then you will be
able to dig for the gold. But don't leave sutters for yet...you must first 
go to the blacksmith's shop and talk to him. He will ask you a few quetions

The Answers are:
Yes
Yes
Last name:Wilson
First name:Jerrod
Brothers name:Jake

Now the blacksmith will give you a branding iron. This will be needed later in 
the game.  From here exit the Fort and goto the Amerincan river to the right.
Keep heding along the river and dig on the land. This takes a very long
time so don't get discouraged.  You must head several screens to the right
in order to find the gold.  After discovering gold about 40 times you will
hit a sudden dry spell.  THis mean that there is no more gold to mine.  So
go back to Sutters Fort and buy a Lantern and a Pan.  The pan is just 
for extra points.  Then go to THE MULE SHOP!!! not THE MULE CORRAL!!
and buy a mule.  After buying the mule go to the Blacksmith's shop. Heat 
your Iron and brand the mule.  Then go to the semetary. Read all the graves 
untill you find Marshall Wilson's grave. Here there will be a seperate 
screen that shows you his grave. you will be able to type here.  Type
Use letter and move it arround untill it says Hey stop there.  Then follow
its directions.  From here take your mule to the corral. Drop him off here.
Then you get another mule. Look at its brand if it looks the same as yours 
then keep him.  This mule will be a trusty spirited mule.  Take the mule with
you to the Town around 23 screens to the right.  Read your bible Psalm 23.
Go tho Green Pastures hotel and rent room 11.  The man will give you a message
to give to the man in room 11.  Go to room 11 knock on the door and give the
message to the man. He will leave the room. You will enter, Go to the
fireplace and turn the wheel.  Enter the fireplace you will appear on the 
other side in a room.  Go to the window unlock it and open it. Go to the table
and read the letter. Get the magnet and the sting which is on the floor.
The bird will soon fly in and give the photo to the bird. He will fly away
you will here a slam.  The bird will reappear you get the aerogram and read
it.  Before you enter the fireplace again wait for another slam. Once you here 
this you will be safe.  Leave the room and go back to Fort Sutter.  Once you
getc 2 East of Fort Sutter you must type follow mule. He will lead you to
Jake's Cabin.  Eneter Jakes Cabin. Get the matches and move the rug, then
manuever your way through the bushes and then enter the Jon. 

Enter the hole in the Jon. YES I AM SERIOUS!!.  Ok you will then go down
and find yourself in a pile of shit.  Light your Match and light your
lantern. Then head to the left untill you come to a door. Tie the string to
the Magnet and put the magnet in the hole. Lower magnet. Raise magnet and 
unlock door. Eneter the room to the other side. From here go down and then go
to your left. You will have to go down again. Down there you will find a pick.
use the pick a place in the room and you will stike gold..twice. From here
head back to the main ladder.  Go up past the ledge that you came from and you
will notice a passage leading to your left. Go to it and keep on going untill 
you get to another ladder goining down.  You will then come across another 
ladder going down.  You must manuever down this ladder. Be careful.  Here
you must go left again and you will find Jake. He will tell you a story and
then you must use your pick in the highlighted area. You will strike it
several times.  Keep digging untill a hole appears. Digg untill it gets even
bigger and then you enter the hole with your brother. Hey let the game do
