Short : HD-Installer for Global Gladiators
Type : game/patch
Author : Bored Seal & JOTD

This patch applies to "Global Gladiators" by Virgin (c) 1993 - 2 disks.
Slave requires WHDLOAD V10+
Game requires 0.5MB ChipRAM + 0.5MB any RAM (+ 1.8MB for Preload)

FEATURES:
- Game loads entirely from HD
- Disk protection removed
- BPLCON0 access fixed (4x)
- 24bit access fault fixed
- tested with CD32 (CD32 CIAs tend to emit level 6 interrupts that lockup the game)

- Quit option (your default key) inc. on 68000 machines
- source code included

HISTORY:
V1.0 (16-Dec-1998) - first release

V1.2 (13-Apr-2016) - (JOTD) fixed level 6 interrupt lockup on checkered screen (CD32 & others).  [issue #003402]
