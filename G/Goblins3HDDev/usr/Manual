           GOBLINS 3 - ENGLISH - DOX TYPED BY FAIRLIGHT

-PH!

THE STORY
---------

For thousands of years the two kindoms ruled by Queen XJNNA and
King BODD have fiercely completed to be the first to conquer 
the labrinth in the bowels of Mount Foliandre. According to the
legend, the goblin who manages to come through all the tests in
the Labyrinth of Foliandre will win eternal well+beeing for his 
people.
So far, all those who have tried their luck have returned completly
insane, and a river of bitterness continues to flow from the 
Mountin through the two hostile kingdoms....

This ancestral struggle has for years fascinated all the greatest
historians and especially the readers of 'GOBLINS NEWS'. BLOUNT,
one of the most talented journalists of the newspaper, has for
along time dreamed of obtaining a sensational scoop.

But something new has occured : BEHORN, the guardian of the Labyrinth
and the only person who can gurantee that the tests have been passed
fairly, has just died of extreme old age. More disturbing is the 
fact that the key to the enterance has disappered! And, what is even 
more serious: his daughter WYNNONA, who is the natural successor, 
cannot be found!

Has WYNNONA been kidnapped? Is she in danger?  Without the key, how
can the champions now try to overcome the obstracles of the labyrinth?
Has one of the monarchs stolen the key to be able to explore the 
labyrinth, despite what the rules say?

BLOUNT wants to find the answers to these questions. He has made up
his mind: he will go to the two kingdoms and interview the two rivals.
While he is there, he will try to draw their portraits, since nobody
has any idea what the two hostile monarchs look like.


THE JOURNEY
----------- 

BLOUNT starts out by boarding a flying vessel, for Mount Foliandre
is in a very remote region. But when he leaves his cabin the 
following day he finds that the captain, the crew and the rats have
abandoned the vessel..... which is then bombarded by huge rocks. 
Great holes have already appeared in the hull and the nodse is dipping
slowly but surely... BLOUNT must get off his ship before it capsizes 
cpmpletly...

This is only the beginning of a long series of hair-raising adventures..
Very soon he meets WYONNA who is beeing maltreated by King BODD's 
henchmen. He imediatly intervenes and comes up against a fierce wolf who
leaves him for dead and possessed of a Werewolf personality which reveals
itself any time he is exposed to the Moon.

BLOUNT has to find a means of transport and then concoct weird potions
in the laboratory of an alcemist, potions such as the "Winglixir" or wing
elixir which will enable him to reach the kingdoms of XJNA and BODD.
He will, of course, obtain these two interviews.

He will even be able, thanks to his double personality, to try to overcome
the obstracles of the Labyrinth and become the champion of both XJNA 
and BODD. Maybe then he will be able to succesfully resolve the conflict
that opposes the two kingdoms.


THE AIM OF THE GAME
-------------------

BLOUNT must get into the castles of King BODD and Queen XINA. The 
places he passes through are grouped into small worlds made up of 2 or 3
screens that link up. Each world contains an enigma whose solution is
scrattered about in different elements of the screens which make up
the world.

BLOUNT sets out on his own, but he meets other characters in the course
of the game. These include CHUMP the parrot, FULBERT the boa-constrictor
and OOYA the sage. Though you can select them and make them move like
BLOUNT, they will not pick up objects and their actions are few and
selective. BLOUNT can only succeed by combining his actions with those
of the characters who accompany him.

For example: while FULBERT swings the candelabra, BLOUNT can hold on 
to it. In this case, the timing is all important: to succeed, you must
make your move neither too early nor too late.


INTERACTIVITY
-------------

When BLOUNT and one of his companions are on the screen at the same time, 
they can be manipulated simultaneously. But the others must be given
alternativly by activating one character at a time. When activated, the
character you select is seen in profile on the screen. To change to 
another character , all you have to do is to click the left mouse on 
him.

 The Screen is divided into four areas: 
 
 - The control panel , which appears on the top of the screen when the
arrow cursor touches the first three lines of the screen.

 - The central part, where the action takes place, which we see 
scrolling over more than one screen, the digital screen, the command
line, or the last line of the screen. 


When you move the cursor arrow about the screen it corresponds to the 
act of investigating. A text appears on the command line when you
move into a special zone. This allows you to find: 

 - Special places or objects, 
 - Characters: you can show them or give them the objects or
allow them to express themselves, exit the cursor (arrow) into a door.

When you click the cursor arrow on the ground : the goblin goes to the
chosen place. 

On an active zone: the goblin moves up to the place indicated and 
carries out the corresponding action. e.g on a button, he presses it.  
On the object: the goblin moves towards the object
and picks it up. This will casue the object cursor (a barred arrow)
to appear. This means that you are folding the object. 
The phrase "USE (Name of object) ON" appears on the command line. 
The object can be put into immediate use or placed in the inventory.


THE CONTROL PANEL
------------------ 

All you have to do call it up is to place the cursor at the top of 
the screen: six icons then appear. Choose one function by clicking
on the icon with the left mouse butoon.

1- Game management: A menu "SAFEGUARD", "LOAD & SAVE", "QUIT".

- Safeguard: These are positions for safeguarding your place in the
game onto the hard disk or an external disk. Select a line, write the
name of your safeguard.

- Load: each of the positions can be called up. The game will be as you 
left it. 

- Quit: allows you to leave the game.

2- JOKERS: you have several jokers available per situation, which will
give you extra clues if you should be really stuck.  

3- GOBLINS NEWS: the cover page of each edition, giving a summary of 
the current achievements of the hero in his quest, may be consulted on 
each screen.

4- INVENTORY: another way of gaining acces to the inventory.

5- AIM OF THE CURRENT PHASE: a map indicating the local puzzle and your
precise actual location. 

6-OPTIONS: 
 
 - Music: This allows you to turn the sound track on or off. The symbol
")" indicates that the "music on" option was chosen.

 - Info: gives you the date, the hour and the time spent on the game.



SOME ADVICE!
----------------

- When you get to a new screen, start by picking out the important
zones and objects.

- Don't spend too much time in a single screen. Explre the nearby
screens to find clues.

- Click on the same character several times: he can say different
things each time. 

- There is no need to wait for a character to finish his action
before activating the next.

- There are no stale-mate situations ; the key objects are inexhaustible.
As the character cannot die, you just have to start the action again
if an action or series of actions fails. 

- Dont forget to try each character on each zone: they dont always react
in the same way, and can give you different results.

- Use the objects often on the zones, even in the most far-fetched 
combinations, with each of the characters. 

Dont forget , that they like joking!!
