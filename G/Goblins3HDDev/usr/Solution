back to Xina and get the skull if you want...[See Xina] to get back to Xina,
you must turn OFF the candles, and put together another sentence. It's pretty
easy. Just use the wand on the candles. After the mouth grows, you must use
the coin on the mouth so that Blount will go in. Give the skull t Bodd when
you get it. Getting the slipper is hard, but here's how : Make sure you have
a plate. Make sure Tibo has the gun. Make sure the Buffoon has the wand. Now,

require some timing. I do suggest saving first, so you don't have to get
another plate each time. Now, give the slipper to Xina. If you already gave
