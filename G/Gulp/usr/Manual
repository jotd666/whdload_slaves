                       EARTH DISASTER HEADQUARTERS

The Earth has been flooded by the menace of the meddling scientists, who in
an effort to control our weather systems ended up drowning the entire planet.
Groups of Humans hang on holding their breath and pray that somewhere out in 
the far Galaxy there is someone brave enough to rescue this poor sodden 
planet.

                        INTERACTIVE DISTRESS MESSAGE


The Alien Interactive Distress receiver (AIDM) received and translated the 
terrifying message from the Humans of planet Earth. The AIDM knows that there
is only one intergalactic hero troop capable of taking on such a gigantic 
task and that is Captain Gulp and the Aquarons.

                        CAPTAIN GULP AND THE AQUARONS

Our hero`s plot their course for Earth and prepare for the mighty task which
they have endeavored to undertake. Each Aquaron prepares in their own special
way as they face their ultimate adventure. Unfortunately, preparations were
not all they might have been and our friends ended up on Earth as miniscule
Fish. The fate of the Earth now depends on you, the player guiding the 
Aquarons back to their vessel, where they will resize to save the Earth.

                          RESIZED TO SAVE THE WORLD

Resized are intreped Aquarons drank all the water covering the world to 
return it to their own planet, where water was always welcome. The scientist
vowed never to meddle again, or at least not for a week or two and the people
around took great deep breaths.

                          MORPHING THE AQUARONS

There are two ways to change your fish into different morphs. Either change
one at a time or set one fish as leader to change every fish that touches
the leader. Note: to be changed by a leader the fish must be facing the same
way as the leader. The following cannot be used as leaders: EXPLODE, TORPEDOS
BULLETS, HAMMER, WALL and PUFFER.

LEADER MORPH:
Right mouse button on required MORPH, then left mouse button on required fish

By selecting the picture of your required MORPH, from the top panel with the  
right mouse button youu will be able to assign one of your trusty fishes to
be a leader. The leader fish will animate in his position and every fish that
touched him/her will be morphed into that MORPH type.

For example: Select a leader for springing, with the right mouse button. The
leader fish will stay in it`s position and gently spring up and down. Every
fish that then touches that fish will begin to spring into action.

INDIVIDUAL MORPH:  Left mouse button on required MORPH, then left button on
required fish.

By selecting the picture of yuor required MORPH, from the top panel with the
left mouse button you will be abale to change your selected fish into that
MORPH type.

For example: Select a spring MORPH from the top panel. Then select a fish 

with the left mouse button and your fish will spring into action.

THE FISH HOOK
Use the mouse to control the fish hook.

BUBBLE  Move the hook over a fish and a bubble will encase him or her. You
may now apply a MORPH to the fish by clickibg on the left mouse button. Hold
this over the fish for any length of time and the fish name will be displayed
on the message area, along with a message.

ARROW  Move the hook near to the edge of the play area and it wil change into
an arrow. There are eight possible compass directions.

Note: While the cursor is an arrow you are still able to operate MORPH 
functions.

                             INSIDE EACH LEVEL

MOVEABLE OBJECTS  The movable objects will help you by operating switches
that your fish cannot reach and blocking off unpleasant areas. The fish can
push the objects around and over edges. The moveable object is always prone 
to its environment, if it is on a slope it will roll. For example; On one lab
level, the eyeball rests on a shelf. By operating a nearby switch the shelf
will tilt, this causes the eyeball to roll down the shelf and fall off.

SWITCHES  Move the fish over a switch or drop a moveable object onto it and
it will effect an area on the screen, by switching it on or off, opening or
closing it etc.. The area affected may be a door, a transporter, a death zone
a shelf a current or any one of the different action areas that are in the 
game. Keep an eye on what changes and be careful that things do not change
for the worse.

TRANSPORTERS  These are areas which will transport your fish from one area to
another. They may work both ways or be only one way. Note that some 
transporters may need to be switched on using a nearby switch.

DEATH ZONES  There are many areas of danger for the fish and the death zones
are the worst. Do not go anywhere near them unless you can find a switch to
disable them.

DOORS  Doors will open at the flick of a switch and come in many different 
disguises.

BITEABLE AREAS  Your fish will need to chomp through here.

DRILLABLE AREAS  These areas are tougher than biteable areas and will need to
be drilled through.

CURRENTS  Currents flow through the water and will take your fish along with
them. Their speed and direction vary and some can be changed by switches.

EXPLODABLE AREAS  Exploding through areas can be tough and unfortunately your
fish will be lost in the process. Set your fish to explode and watch him or
her approach a wall. When the fish is up against the wall turn it into a 
puffer and wait for the explosion. Beware: you cannot turn a puffer into an
exploding fish but you can turn an exploding fish into a puffer. You can also
use Torpedo MORPHS to explode these areas.

MONSTERS  There are some really mean creatures out there waiting for an 
innocent fish to pass by. Get rid of these enemies by using a torpedo, bullet
hammer or exploding fish.

BONUSES  Collect bonuses which will appear in many different forms.

EXTRA MORPHS  Collect these to add to your inventory of MORPHS at the top of 
the screen.

FOOD  Eat, munch and enjoy and gain lots of wonderful points.

CHANGING MORPHS  If your fish swim over these areas your fish will change 
into that type of MORPH.

                                THE MORPHS
 
IN THE SEA  Not surprisingly, even for alien fish, the natural state of your
fish is in water. Your fish will swim along until they can go no further 
rather than collide, they will turn around and swim in the opposite 
direction.

IN THE AIR  To travel through the air your fish must be MORPHED into fish
with watertanks. Now as they walk through the air they can use different
MORPHS that they can not use in water.

UNDEWATER MORPHS

BITTING   Bite through areas that are bitable.
DRILLING  Drill through these areas that are drillable.
FLIPPING  Use the tail of a fish to flip others through the air.
TORPEDO   Torpedos can be used to destroy enemies and explodable areas.
WEIGHT    Morph your fish into weights and watch hem drop through the water.
WATERTANK Use this underwater to make your fish rise up to the top. Use this
at the surface to make your fish walk out into the air.
PUFFER    Use this and your fish will puff up to stop any other fish passing
by. Very useful if applied to an exploding fish for accuracy in blowing up
explodable areas.
TURBO     Speeds your fish though the water. Be careful not to hit a 
collidable area as your fish will not withstand the collision.

AIR MORPHS

WALL      Turn your walking fish into a wall and it will stop any fish from
passing by.
HAMMER    Use the hammer to whack a monster over the head. 
SPRING    Use the spring MORPH to bounce over obsticles.
FLYING    Fly through the air to rach otherwise unaccessable places.
BULLET    Blast your enemies into oblivion with this Kamikaze MORPH.

BOTH AIR AND WATER MORPH

EXPLODE   Use this to explode enemies and collidable areas.   

                                PROBLEMS

DISK SWAPPING
If the program asks for a disk and having put in the requested disk it still
displays the same message, then reinsert the disk which was in the drive when
the message appeared and wait a few seconds. Once the drive light has gone on 
and off then reinsert disk 3.

Do you have enough memory?
Hard drive version.
Make sure you have 420 chip(graphics) and 420(extra) memory.
Suggestions to increase: Hold down mouse buttons on boot-up and disable any
floppy diskdrives and then select boot without start-up. Then type "cd-gulp"
the "gulp" to start the game.
