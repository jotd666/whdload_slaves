 This install applies to "Gods Demo" © 1990 The Bitmap Brothers.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.0 (14.02.05) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - ROM access fixed
 - SMC removed
 - DBF active loops fixed (music)
 - source code included

 note: The demo is very similar to levels 1 & 2 of world 1 of the full game, although some
 secrets are slightly different (example: first hidden switch on level 1)
 if someone comes up with a walkthrough including all secrets, I'd be VERY interested and
 will add it to the new release.
