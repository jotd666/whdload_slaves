 This install applies to "Guardian" © 1993 Acid Software

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 CD³² version and AGA version:

 The installed program requires 1.5 MB ChipMem and 2.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.0 (27.05.2022) done by JOTD:
 - better joypad controls (issue #0002926)
 - support for floppy version
 - updated CD32 version to use kickemu
 - trainer
 
 version 1.0 (2001) done by JOTD:
 - no need for joypad, can be emulated by function keys
 - CD access removed
 - Save/load hiscore
 - Nice icon by Exoticons
 - Docfile included

 note: support for function keys is not present in floppy
 version. This isn't that useful since there are too many
 keys to press. Get a joypad or play with mouse.
