THE STORY SO FAR

Guardian is a fast and frantic 3D shoot 'em up set in the future. The
action takes place in a rapidly shrinking universe only a few light years in
diameter. Millions of life forms are battling desperately for possession of
the few remaining resources, while turning a blind eye to the implications
of the imminent Big Bang. You have been selected as a 'Guardian', one of
an elite troop of pilots charged with the protection of what is left of the
human species. Your job is to repel the relentless attacks of alien life
forms on a series of populated planets. Should you fail, the human
species faces certian destruction. The rewards of success, however, are
not so clear.


GETTING STARTED

To begin play, simply turn off your Amiga CD32 insert the guardian CD and
turn the CD32 back on. After a short delay the game will be loaded and you
will be ready to play. Make sure you have a 6 button CD32 joypad connected
in either port and the volume on your stereo is set to 11. As guardian uses
a 3 dimentional sound effects system you may need to swap the left & right
audio leads connected to your CD32 so explosions etc. are heard from the
correct speaker and hence diection during play.

OPTIONS

By pressing the Play/Pause button on the joypad an options screen will

shoulder buttons can be used to shift the position of the screen on your TV.


GAMEPLAY

Your primary targets are the Dronoids - alien craft armed with powerful
trilium bombs capable of destroying planetary installations. Destroying
a number of Dronoids will cause the enemy to temporarily give up thier
attack. Allowing the Dronoids to destroy all the planetary installations
will allow the enemy to strengthen thier attack - not a good idea!
Two scanners are available to aid you in your mission. The left hand scanner
represents the location of all Dronoids located on the planet surface, use
this to seek them out before they destroy the planets valuable
installations. The right hand scanner is a close range radar alerting you
to the location of nearby alien forces. You have 2 special weapons
available - smart bombs & tracking missiles. Igniting a smart bomb will
destroy all aliens within a visible radius, while a tracking missile will
home in on and destroy the nearest Dronoid. At the start of the game you are
given a supply of three ships and three smart bombs. Extra ships and smart
bombs are earned every 30000 points. 3 tracking missiles are also awarded
every 30000 points.


POWER UPS

Shooting a Dronoid may result in the release of a power up. If collected,
your ship will be enhanced in one of the following ways.

Shield Boost     - Increases your ships shield.
Laser Boost      - Increases the speed of your laser bombs.
Twin Lasers      - Allows your ship to fire 2 lasers at once!
Tracking Missile - Increases your stock of tracking missiles.

Power ups may be stockpiled. For example, if you collect a twin laser power
up while your ship already has twin lasers, the power up will be reserved
for use with your next life.


HINTS & TIPS

The job of Guardian is an extremely difficult and dangerous task. Only with
hours of practice and dedication can you hope to become one of the elite
pilots of our time. The following points may also help in your fight to save
the shrinking universe * Dronoid destruction should always be top priority *
Don't destroy your own installations, you only loose points and aid the
enemy * Fly slalom through installations to lead the enemy to their
destruction * Flip then reverse thrust to get aliens on your tail into your
sights * Keep the scanners in the corner of your eye at all times * Catch
bonus power ups as quickly as possible for maximum points.
