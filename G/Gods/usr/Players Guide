                   THE ULTIMATE PLAYERS GUIDE TO: GODS


GENERAL ADVICE
--------------
Gods is split up into four levels with each level containing three worlds.
There is more than one way to complete each world and no world needs to be
fully completed to finish the game. Additionally, there are many hidden
puzzles and sections which can provide rewards. Some worlds have short cuts
which enable the level to be completed quickly but you may lose out on
treasure and other bonuses by taking them. It's up to you to experiment
with the game to find out what is best to do.

MONSTERS
--------
All the monsters encountered in Gods have attributes that define their
weaknesses, strengths and behaviour. The hit point "HP" attribute sets how
many times a monster must be hit before it dies. A weak monster would have
perhaps 10 hit points where a stronger creature could have 250 or more. As
you progress thru the game you will notice that the monsters become more
intelligent. This means that they will be more effective at carrying out
their objectives to steal treasure, kill or avoid you. It's not wise to
attack thieves as they're usuall helpful.

WEAPONS
-------
Weapons also have attributes which define their behaviour and
effectiveness. The weapons hit point score determines how powerful it is.
For example, to kill a monster with 20 hit points would require 20 throws
of a one hit point weapon (a knife for example) or 4 throws of a five hit
point weapon (like a fireball). Weapons which go past walls are generally
more effective. Overall, the value of the weapon reflects its usefulness.

POTIONS
-------
Correct use of potions can be helpful in completing many sections in Gods.
You can normally only carry three items so don't buy to many potions in the
shop, leave room for other objects necessary for solving puzzles.

POWER POTIONS
-------------
These are used to increase the effectiveness of weapons. Buying or picking
up a power potion increases the damage done by ALL of your weapons. The
same effect can be achieved by getting multiples of the same weapon.
Considering power potions effect all the weapons, they are obviously a far
more economical way of increasing weapon hit points than buying or picking
up multiples of the same weapon.

EXTRA LIVES
-----------
Additional lives are found in treasure rooms but they can also be awarded
for clever play and scoring points. Extra lives can also be given to a
player that is doing badly.


Below is the easiest and quickest way thru level 1, plus one or two hidden
areas and how to find them.....

LEVEL ONE
---------
WORLD ONE

The first world of the game is used to enable to get the player used to the
control method and solve some puzzles which are really easy. The first key
you'll need is the one to open the treasure room. The world key is in the
treasure room and opens the door at the end of the world. For a shortcut,
reset levels one and two to move block one. This will reveal a water
crystal and power-up and teleport you.

HOW TO FIND THE SECOND PUZZLE

1. Blow up the trap with lever four and then pull lever three to reveal an
iron treasure chest.
2. Reset lever four and pull lever five to get a fire crystal.
3. Pull lever seven within two minutes from the game start to make platform
two move.
4. Press hidden switch one to get fire crystal.
5. Finding these four puzzles will mean that you can find the final part of
the puzzle in World Two.


LEVEL ONE
---------
WORLD TWO

Get the key on the left of the screen to open the trap door on the right.
Make sure you go over the top platforms as the bottom route is more
difficult but will give you bonus crystals.
Collect the vase and take it to the stores at the bottom of the map, snatch
the room key on the way. Get the world key from stores to exit on the
right. Buy Shurikens and Normal Arc at the shop.

HOW TO GET INTO THE TREASURE ROOM

1. Kill the monsters on the ledge on the right of lever three to recieve a
trap door key. this will let you close the trap door above lever nine by
pulling lever four. You will then be able to jump down and open the
treasure room door.
2. Push all four hidden switches to open the trap doors which form the base
of the treasure room. All treasure will then fall thru onto the floor
beneath the room.


LEVEL ONE
---------
WORLD THREE

Pull switch two to close the trap doors and blow up the spike in the pit.
Get the giant jump to go up the trap doors.
Alternatively, you can wait for two minutes and a teleport crystal will
appear to move you up, although you will not get the special bonus. Get the
key on the top left platform to open the trap door to the right. Go up the
ladder which leads to the towers. Go up the ladders to the bridge and jump
across the platforms to the left to collect the trap door key. Go right and
collect the teleport key. Open the door by pulling lever eleven and this
will teleport you to the platform on the far left of the map. Collect the
door key. Go right and pull lever seven and drop down thru the trap door.
Pull lever eight to teleport you to the top door on the right. Pull lever
nine to enter the treasure room and collect the lightening bolt. Pulling
lever ten will open the door and take you back. Collect the world key and
go down the ladder and when you reach the bottom platform you will recieve
a trap door key. Pull lever twelve and go down to defeat the centurion
protecting the temple.
Go up the ladder to the temple and enter the door to exit the level. In the
shop you should buy the Magic Axe and spend the rest of your money on Power
Potions.

HOW TO ENTER THE TREASURE ROOM

Kill the wave of monsters which appear to the left of lever three. They
will give you a trap key. Reset lever three, which will then give you a
shield when you pull lever four to protect you when you drop through the
trap door to the treasure room.

TO MOVE BLOCK ONE

You have to get to this point with more than two lives, more than 80,000
points and within 140 seconds from the start of this world.

DEFEATING THE END OF LEVEL GUARDIAN

The Centurion is the easiest of the bosses. Watch the Centurion as he
throws fireballs and note the point where they bounce the highest. This is
the place you should stand to kill the Boss without getting hit. Move
backwards and forwards at the same time as the Centurion, keeping the same
relative position in order to avoid being hit.

SPECIAL BONUSES

Kill the Centurion without collecting the lightening bolt to recieve a gold
treasure chest.
