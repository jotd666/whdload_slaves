=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 04 ]=====

PART I: GETTING STARTED IN GENESIA

Chapter 1 - A FEW WORDS ON GENESIA

Once upon a time, blinded by love, the Prince of the land of Genesia defied
the all-mighty Gods. For the love of a treacherous woman, he had the tomb of
the God Neort opened and the sacred jewels removed to adorn his beloved. But
the wrath of the Gods fell on the country and its inhabitants.
Today, three of his descendants are returning to the beatiful land of
GENESIA. But only one can obtain forgiveness from the Gods by recovering the
jewels of Neort.


Chapter 2 - INSTALLATION AND LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

ATARI AND AMIGA

The AMIGA and ATARI versions of GENESIA require at least 1 MB of RAM. The
ATARI ST must be a 1040 at least.

- Amiga and Atari, without hard disk

Turn off your computer, then turn it back on. Insert the GENESIA
"Configuration" diskette and follow instructions. On Amiga, if your computer
has two floppy disk drives, you must disconnect the second drive so that
Genesia can run smoothly.
If you want to continue a game where you left off using the same data (e.g.,
number of players, map number, etc. stored on a diskette), turn your computer
off, insert diskette 2, and turn the computer back on. If you want to load
configuration ptions, load GENESIA from the Configuration diskette.

- Amiga with hard disk

Turn your computer off and insert the configuration diskette or diskette no.
2 if you want to play with the same options. Follow the instructions.

- Warning!

If your Amiga is equipped with just 1 MB of RAM and a ROM 2.0, you cannot
play with the additional soundtrack (See PART IX, Options).

- Saving

* If the game is installed on the hard disk, you must save on the hard disk
  or on a diskette.
* If you are using diskettes, you must save on a diskette formatted with the
  name

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 05 ]=====

GENESAVE. The program will ask you to insert the disk when needed (see PART
IX, SAVING - LOADING).


PC and compatible (hard disk is mandatory)

* Turn on your computer according to the usual procedure.
* Insert diskette 1 in the 3"1/2 drive and type the name of the drive (A or
  B) followed by ":", then press RETURN.
* Type INSTALL, then RETURN.
* Follow the instructions on the screen.


Starting up the game:

Once GENESIA is installed on your hard disk:

* Under DOS, type CD GENESIA and RETURN
* Type GENESIA and RETURN.


Chapter 3 - OBJECT OF THE GAME

YOUR MISSION

Before you start out on thsi adventure, remember that GENESIA needs only one
master, the greatest strategist of all times: YOU.
In the world of GENESIA you must demonstarte your superiority at all times:

- You must have the strongest armies to expand your territory.
- You must be able to guide your people and make sure they lack nothing.
- You must be the best in managing technological progress.

You must expand at the smoothest possible pace.
To do this, you must take into account several paramaters, such as nature
(e.g., the weather, water resources and wood) and the morale of your
population which will have an impact on its productivity.

You can use the skills of several trades to build thsi new world, including
farmers, woodsmen, blacksmiths, soldiers, carpenters, and others. Of course,
none of this will come easily. Even as you work, the other captains are
striving on their own lands.


* The ultimate goal

Bear in mind at all times that you must find the 7 jewels. You can achieve
this thanks to

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 06 ]=====

the development of your economy, your military strength and technolgical
skill.

Before we move on to more detailed explanations, let us give you a word of
advice: a jewel won can be lost again.


HOW TO WIN

GENESIA is not simply a race against the clock. There are sveral ways to win.
In this paragraph we will examine the eaisest way to start out. As you grow
more familiar with the game, you will develop your own strategy.


Be the first to recover all 7 jewels.

To do this, you must develop your economy and build up considerable resources
to recruit several men to find the jewels as soon as possible. Moreover, you
must protect the jewles and thus build up necessary defences. Lastly, you can
decide to attack the zones on which your enemies store their own jewels.


Be the only player left.

This consists of eliminating all of your adversaries. This can be done in
several ways:

- By capturing all of a player's lands (see PART II, Chapter 8 - CAPTURING A
  LAND)
- By crushing him militarily
- By ruining him financially (e.g., by destroying his stocks, see PART II,
  Chapter 5 - The warehouse).


DEFEAT

You have lost the game if:

- All of the jewels have been found by one of your adversaries
- You have no land or armies left.



Chapter 4 - COMPETING FORCES

NUMBER OF PLAYERS

When you start up the game, the program asks the number of players. 1 to 3
people can play. At the beginning of each game there are always 3 players.


INDICATE THE NUMBER OF HUMAN PLAYERS

* Click on 1 if you are playing alone. In this case, you play the first
  captan and the two

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 07 ]=====

  other captains are played by the computer.

* Click on 2 if two people are playing. Player number 2 plays the second
  captain and the third captain is played by the computer.
* Click on 3, if three people are playing. Each one plays a captain.

Enter the names of the players on the keyboard and press RETURN to confirm.


CHARACTERS PLAYED BY THE COMPUTER

The captains played by the computer have the same goal as you. However,
during the game some captains played by the computer can stress economic
strategies, while others can be far more aggressive (see PART I, Chapter 3).


Chapter 5 - THE DIFFERENT MAPS

You can choose between five different worlds. Depending on the world you
choose, the computer will apply a specific plicy and the game's configuration
will be different. We recommend starting with world no. I (the computer's
choice by default).

Each map (i.e., world) has its own strategy.


Chapter 6 - USING THE MOUSE

SCROLLING ON THE GAME SCREEN

To scroll down the map, point the mouse arrow in the direction you want on
the edge of the screen.


MOUSE BUTTONS

Clicking on the mouse buttons has a different impact depending on the screen
zone. We will look at the different effects and functions.



PART II: THE ECONOMY


Chapter 1 - THE INHABITANTS OF GENESIA

YOUR POPULATION

Like any society, your people will evolve.
In the following chapter, we will see that the inhabitants of GENESIA have
different

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 08 ]=====

trades. For the first time in this type of game, the inhabitants have their
own lives. They work, pay taxes, get married, have children, age, etc. And
they are vulnerable to various illnesses.
You start out with a small population made up of settlers who each live in
their own hut. You must take care to provide them with work as soon as
possible.


Rule no. 1

Each inhabitant of your land must have a house.
If one of your inhabitants does not have a home, he will revolt, refuse to
work and is liable to turn your people against you or desert your territory.


Time

As in real life, time in GENESIA is measured in years.
Each year is divided into four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter).
A season represents one turn.
The game begins in spring.


Morale

This is the inhabitants' main feature. It is measured on a scale of 0 to 7.
When an inhabitant has a morale of 0/7, this is disastrous: he either deserts
the territory or dies.
In contrast, a morale of 7/7 makes this inhabitant an excellent, particularly
productive woker, and a great soldier. You can easily see that morale has a
determining impact on several factors of GENESIA, including productivity,
military strength, the desire to start a family, the number of births, etc.


Births

Increasing the population is also extremely important. One way to do this is
to increase the number of births. To do this, you need:

- A land with abundant water and food.
- Homes capable of containing at least two people (see PART II, Chapter 5 -
  Houses).
- A man and woman living in the same house.

If these three conditions are met, you will soon have the pleasure of
celebrating the birth of a beatiful baby!
He will soon be counted in your population when he grows old enough to work,
i.e., when he reaches the age of 16.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 09 ]=====

Note: to make the game easier to play you do not have to wait 16 turns (i.e.,
years) before you can employ this new recruit!

Remark: One home can include at most 2 inhabitants.


Age

From year to year, your inhabitants age.

- At 16, they are included in the available workers when they become old
  enough to work.
- Between 20 and 30 they tend to get married. This is the period during which
  they are the most efficient. However, their morale can decline and increase
  rapidly because they have not reached full stability.
- Between 30 and 40, they become vulnerable to viruses and other diseases,
  but their morale is also less volatile because they have achieved a certain
  stability.
- Over 49, they die of old age.


Diseases

Several diseases can strike your population (we will not list them here so
that you can discover them as you play).

These diseases have various features:

- Some of them are only contagious in a given season.
- Some go away by themselves.
- Some are very contagious.
- Others are deadly.

They all have something in common:
*   When one of your inhabitants is struck by a disease, he can no longer
    work, and he doesn't pay taxes anymore. However, he tends to consume
    more food and water to fight his infection.
**  When an inhabitant is sick, by the end of his convalescence, he will have
    aged one or several years.
*** The only way to fight the various illnesses is to discover vaccines to
    immunise your people (see inventions).


THE POPULATIONS OF OTHER PLAYERS

The inhabitants live in enemy territory and evolve in the same way. You can
lure the population of other players onto your own land by capturing virgin
territry in the vicinity of

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 10 ]=====

enemy lands, then by developing an important production site.



NOMADS

Nomads are men and women who live on no land. They travel over the lands of
GENESIA in search of a province or land on which to settle. Nomads are
essential because their strong morale makes them excellent workers.

To lure them onto your land you must have:

- A vacant home.
- Enough water and food in stock.
- An average morale of over 5.
- No edpidimics.
- No battles underway in your land.


Chapter 2 - TRADES

OUTDOOR TRADES

These are the trades that are performed outside the home. It is important to
differentiate them from other trade categories (indoor trades) when shifting
a worker from one trade to another (see PART II, Chapter 3 - Changes of
trade).

When a worker begins his work in the course of season, he will not be
available again until the following seas. The season affect the yield of
these trades (see PART II, Chapter 4 - The impact of seasons).


Farmers

Farmers are crucial for your economy.

Thanks to them, and mostly to their crops, you will be able to increase the
number of inhabitants on your land, guarantee the morale of your population,
meet the needs of other territories, prevent famine, etc.

To work, a farmer needs a field to till. When the game starts you have none.
To create a field, go to the construction window (see PART II, Chapter 6 -
Constructions) and click on Field.

In the window representing the type of construction being built, you will see
the drawing of a field appear. Click on the site on the game screen on which
you wish to place the field. Choose a plain, and if possible, close to home.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 11 ]=====

On your following turn, you will see a farmer tilling the field. A farmer
cannot farm more than one field.

You need as many fields as you have farmers, if you do not have enough
fields, the extra farmers will not work. If you have no warehouse, your
farmers will store no food, everything that is produced will have to be
consumed right away and any surplus will be wasted. To prevent this disaster,
make sure you build a warehouse quickly to store your food and avoid a
famine (See PART II, Chapters 5 and 6).


Learn to use your farmers in the most productive seasonssuch as spring and,
especially, autumn, when the harvest is optimal.


In winter, your farmers (and your woodsmen and carpenters) do not go out
because of the harsh weather. Remember to store enough food to keep your
inhabitants alive during this period in which there are no cops.


The balance sheet (see PART II, Chapter 9, the balance sheets) will give you
an indication of how long your supplies will last.


Example:

Food = 3 seasons

-> Explanations:

Supposing you have no crops, you will have food for the three following
seasons. However, if the number of inhabitants increases or declins, th
forcast will change as well.


Woodsmen

Wood is an important raw matrial in GNSIA because it is needed in all
constructions. But before you can use wood in your constructions, you will
ned to employ woodsmn to cut down trs. The woodsmn will choose which forests
to xploit. ach woodsmn will cut down his own tree. You will se thm cutting th
tree, it will take on woodsman a full season to cut down a tree. Once the
work is done, each tr is replaced by thre trunks. The amount of wood availabl
to the carpenter will vary depending on th woodsman's moral. When he is done
with one tree he will move on to the next.


Warning!

Be careful not to cut down an entire forest, which would b ecological
diasater (See

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 12 ]=====

PART II, Chapter 4) To prevent this disaster, remember to keep an eye on the
condition of the vegetation in the balance sheet. If you are in the red,
immediately stop the activities of the woodsmen (see PART II, Chapter 3). In
winter, the woodsmen do not work.


Carpenters

Once a tree is chopped down, it is replaced by three trunks. The next job is
for your carpenter. The carpenter helps the woodsman. The amount of wood
prepared will depend on the carpenter's morale. For a carpenter to be active,
all he needs is an available chopped down tree. Once the carpenter's task is
finished, the wood is stored in one of the warehouses located on your land
(assuming one exists). Carpenters do not work in winter.


Architetcs

Architects will build different constructions (see PART II, Chapter 6 -
Constructions). They can build several types of constructions depending on
what you order. Unless you give them specific instrcutions, they will build
additional homes for your people. You will be able to see your architects
construct buildings and monitor the various stages of construction. To see
the building of an architect under construction, place the mouse cursor on
the building and click with the right-hand button. A window will appear with
information. Architects are the only people that work outdoors even in
winter. Each architect works on his own building. For all outdoor trades,
click with the right-hand button on a worker to find out about his trade
(farmer, woodsman, carpenter or architect) and other characteristics (such as
his sex, morale, function and age). The information will appear in a window,


INDOOR TRADES

The advantages of indoor trades is that, contrary to outdoor trades, they can
be performed all year round (even in winter).

Inventors

Inventions will play a particularly crucial role in helping you fulfil your
mission. Your inventors will create machines that can help you win. But to
recruit inventors, you must supply them with a workshop. The workshop must be
built by an architect. When the workshop is finsihed, you can hire one or
more inventors. If you only have one workshop, but several inventors, all of
your inventors are represented on screen by their chief. With several
inventors, however, your inventions will progress far more rapidly.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 13 ]=====

Similarly, the morale of the inventor has an enormous influence on the speed
with which he performs his task.


Blacksmiths

The blacksmiths help the inevntors. They build products designed by the
inventors. But to create the tools you have ordered, they need raw
materials - and money to increase their motivation.

Like the inventors, several blacksmiths will be represented on the screen by
their chief. A team of blacksmiths is more efficient than a single
blacksmith. The blacksmith can only build certain types of inventions such as
wagons, boats, cannons and balloons.


Specialists

The activities of specialists are performed indoors. At first sight, you may
think that specialists are of little importance compared to other workers.
But you will soon realise that they are very important. Each land of GENESIA
has a specialty such as: culture pearls, fruit, pottery or fabrics.
Specialists increase the market value of the land.

You can sell your speciliaties to the shopkeeper (See PART II, Chapter 6, the
shop) and collect a tidy profit. When you recruit specialists, they will
produce and stock the local speciality. Moreover, the specialist is the only
person capable of producing fabric which is necessary to manufacture wagons,
boats and balloons.


THE IMPACT OF MORALE ON YIELD

The morale of your inhabitants has a determining impact on their
productivity. Morale is measured on a scale of 0 to 7. The higher the morale,
the more productive the labour.


Chapter 3 - MANAGING THE TRADES

CHANGES OF TRADE


Why change the trade of an inhabitant?

Throughout the game you will have to change the trades of your people. The
inhabitants of a land are few and you must carefully adjust their numbers to
have the right trades at the right moment.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 14 ]=====

You need to know the following:


* To recruit soldiers you need settlers (these appear in the settler column
  of the trades window).
* You can place a settler in the trade square that interests you.
* If you have just created farmers, woodsmen, or carpenters, they will not
  become active until the next season.
* When an inhabitant is inactive, a 'ZZ' symbol appears in the window (he's
  asleep!).


Working Conditions

- In winter, farmers, woodsmen and carpenters do not work.
- You must have as many fields as you have farmers.
- You must have enough trees for your woodsmen to cut and thus work.
- Trees must be cut into logs so that the carpenters can take over.
- Sick inhabitants do not work.


When can you change trades?

- Take advantage of the quiet of winter to recruit your armies and explore
  the territory in search of the jewels.
- If you have few inhabitants, make one of them a woodsmen for one season and
  the next season you will have logs instead of a tree. Before the end of the
  season, change your woodsman to a carpenter. This way, he can start to chop
  the logs as of the following seas, supplying the architects with wood.


Warning!

The chopped wood is stored in the warehouse located on your land. If you have
no warehouse, all of the work will be lost.


TRADE CHANGE WINDOW

Appearance

The trade window contains 8 columns.

- Each column represents a trade.
- Each column contains 2 squares.
- Each square can be occupied by one inhabitant.


The figure displayed next to the words 'fields' 'logs' and 'trees' represents
the total amount of each respective item.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 15 ]=====

Instructions

- To load the trade window, click on the flag in the centre of the field.
- To exit the trade window, click with the right button of the mouse.
- To change the trade of an inhabitant, position the cursor on the inhabitant
  of your choice and select by pressing and holding down the left button of
  the mouse. Keep the button pressed and slide the character into the trade
  column of your choice.


Example:

You decide to make an inventor a blacksmith:

-> Press and hold the left-hand button of the mouse on one of the inventors
shown in the inventor column. Then, slide the inventor into the blacksmith
column and release the mouse button.

* When you make on eof your inhabitants a farmer, woodsman or carpenter, the
  character is represented by the 'ZZ' symbol. In the following ses, if the
  character is working, the 'ZZ' symbol will be replaced by an icon
  representing the trade.
* With the mouse, position the cursor on the block occupied by an inhabitant.
  The character's morale level appears in the bottom center f the trade
  window.
* Soldiers are represented in the settlers window. In the screen on the
  previous page, the soldiers are represented in the settlers' column by
  two figures on the second line.
* In the above example, assuming you have barracks on that land, you will not
  be able to recruit more than two new soldiers since you only have two
  available settlers. The settlers are shown in the 'SETTLER' column by the
  two figures on the upper line.
* Newcomers in a land automatically sppear in the settlers window.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 16 ]=====

Chapter 4 - SEASONS AND VEGETATION


As in the real world, there are four different season in a year. Depending on
the season, rain or snow falls on the land of GENESIA. This will affect the
behaviour of the people. Seasons have a particularly strong impact on trades.


SEASONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN GENESIA


Summer

GENESIA starts in summer. This is the seson of het and atmospheric pressurema
and hence of storms and lightning. The problems caused by lightning are the
following:

- Fires: when lightning falls ons trees, it sets fire to the vegetation.
- Scorched land: the fires spread and burn everything, especially crops. Once
  a parcel of land is burnt, it will no longer grow plants. To repair the
  damage select the DESTRUCTION icon (see PART VII, Chapter 1, Definition of
  the icons).

The following incidents happen in summer:

- Summer is not a good season for crops and farners are not optimum in their
  work.
- To prevent damage from lightning, invent the lightning rod (See PART IV and
  PART V of the manual).
- Summer rain storms help replenish underground water supplies.


Autumn

This season is particularly productive for farmers since it is when the crops
are harvested. In autumn, food resources improve considerably. This is when
the earth is most productive, and when the underground water supplies are the
most plentiful.


Winter

Winter in GENESIA is extremely harsh, and all outdoor activities (farming,
lumber and carpentry) automatically come to a stop. Also, the inhabitants
tend to catch colds and more serious diseases that can be very contagious.


Note:

- Quickly invent vaccines to protect the health of your people (see PART IV
  and V).

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 17 ]=====

- In winter, many people are inactive (farmers, woodsmen and carpenters). You
  can take advantage of this period of inaction to enlist the sttlers in your
  army. But be careful: their morale is likely to be a little low which means
  that your soldiers will have few life points.


Spring

Spring raises the mood of your people and raises their morale points, which
is fortunate because spring is also when the taxes are levied. The vegetation
grows back and Nature awakens. Spring is also the season when babies are
born.


CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF DROUGHT

Drought and the depletion of underground water resources is a catastrphe
because this prevents any renewal of natural resources.

* case no. 1

- Too many wells -> depletion of underground water sypplies -> no crops.

solution:

You must destroy certain wells (See PART VII, Chapter 1, Main Screen,
definition of icons, destruction icon), then wait for the rain season for the
underground water reserves to be replenished.

* case no. 2

- too many woodsmen -> too many trees cut down -> no rain -> depletion of
  water supplies.

solution:

Go to the trades window to stop the work of the woodsmen as of the following
season. As long as you have at least one tree, nothing is lost. If the earth
is rich enough, new trees will sprout and the vegetation will return.


Chapter 5 - BUILDINGS

ACTION BUILDINGS

Action buildings are buildings in which you can act.
To enter oone of these buildings, place the cursor of the mouse on the chosen
building and

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 18 ]=====

click on the right-hand button. For information on the building click with
the left-hand button.


The barracks

In the barracks, you can:

Change the taxes

Tell the administrator who is always in the barracks to collect the taxes.
You can increase or decrease the taxes. Choose 5%, 10%, 20% or - if you are
in a particularly generous mood - 0%.

Avoid raising taxes too much. At 20%, your people could revolt rapidly.

Taxes are collected at the end of winter and the amount collected appears at
the beginning of spring on the taxes sheet.


To change the taxes:

- Go to the main screen. Place the cursor on the barracks and click the
  right-hand button to enter the barracks.
- Click on the administrator, which is the character sitting behind the table
  (see PART VII, Chapter 4 - The Barracks). (Place the cursor on the
  adminstrator and click.) Three messages will appear:

- Change the tax rate.
- Recruit an army.
- Offer an alliance.

- Click on tax message.

Several percentages appear.

-Click on the tax rate you want.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 19 ]=====

Recruit armies:

The barracks is the only place you can recruit an army.
As you advance in the game, you will have the choice between different types
of armed forces, but in the beginning of the game, you have only one type of
army, made up of ordinary soldiers. (See part III, Chapter 1 of this manual
for further information on armies).

Warning!

You can only enlist inhabitants who are not working outdoors and who are not
sick. Once your men have been recruited, they will wait for you in front of
the barracks.


The warehouse

Warehouses are a critical factor for the success of your land. You must own
at least one on each of your lands.
The warehouse stores food, drinking water, wood, metal, stone, fruit,
pottery, fabrics and rare pearls. A warehouse has a storage capacity of 500
units.

Warning!

Each of your lands are independent, i.e., land A and land B each have their
own stocks.

To enter a warehouse, position your cursor on the warehouse and click on the
right-hand button.
You can move the contents of your warehouses.
To do this, the inventors and blacksmiths of your land must have invented and
built at least one wagon.

You can sell the contents of the wagon to the shop (see PART II, Chapter 5,
The shop and PART II, Chapter 7 for more information).

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 20 ]=====

The workshop

This is where your inventors and blacksmiths invent and build tools.

You must have a workshop for your inventors and blacksmiths. Inside the
workshop, you can invent and build. To invent, you need one or more inventors
and a workshop.


To launch and invention:

- On the main screen, place the cursor on the workshop and click on the
  right-hand button.
- A window appears providing information on the type of invention being
  produced.
- Clicking on ENTER, to enter the workshop.
- Position the cursor on the inventor - i.e., the character standing before
  the workbench - a message appears to inform you whether your inventor is
  available. If he is not available, he can inform you of the state of his
  research.
- Click on the inventor with the left button to display the invention sheet.
  (see PART IV, Chapter 3 - Inventions).


Warning!

The inventors of the same land work together on the same project.


Example:

If you have three inventors on land A, and you order them to invent
something, all three will work together on that project. You cannot ask all
three of them to work on separate projects.


To build a product which has been invented, you need one or several
blacksmiths and a workshop.

- On the main screen, place the cusror on the workshop and click on the
  right-hand button.
- A window appears providing information on the type of invention being
  produced.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 21 ]=====

- Clicking on ENTER to enter the workshop.
- Place the cursor on the blacksmith (the character holding a hammer and
  standing before the anvil).
- If your blacksmith is available, he will suggest a list of products
  (cannon, wagon, boat and balloon).
- Click on the object you are interested in. The blacksmith will give you a
  list of raw materials needed and will tell you how much it costs to make
  the product.

The blacksmiths of the same land work together on a single project.

Example:

If you have three blacksmiths on land A, and you order them to build
something, all three will work together on that project. You cannot ask them
to work on seperate projects.


The tavern

The tavern is where the adventureres hang out. This is where youc an obtain
information on the jewels. At certain times, you may find sinister looking
individuals seated at the tables. Adventurers are greedy men who like gold,
but they can help you in your quest.

If you buy their information, you may learn where the jewels are. When you
ask as adventurer for information, he will ask you how much you are willing
to pay. Depending on the amount you give, the infromation you receive will be
more or less precise.

- On the main screen, with the mouse, position the cursor on the tavern and
  click on the right-hand button.
- If you see any adventurers (characters sitting at the tables), position the
  cursor on one of the adventurers and click on the left button. A message
  will appear, asking you how much you are willing to pay. Click on the
  desired amount.
- A map of GENESIA will appear. The tavern is at the center of the map and
  the jewels are represented by a lather bag.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 22 ]=====

Warning!

GENESIA is represented at a 45 degree angle while the map the adventurer
shows you is viewed from above. The information may be very vague. The higher
the sum given, the more precise the information you receive will be.


The temple

The temple is a sacred place.
In the temple, you can:
- Make an offering.
- Deposit the jewels.

* It is very umportant to make an offering. Depending on the size of the
  offering, it will lift the morale of your people more or less (those living
  on the land on which the temple is located) and increase the lands 
  fertility.
- From the main screem, position the cursor on the temple with the mouse and
  click with the right button.
- Inside the temple, position the cursor on the Master who will ask you how
  much you are prepared to offer. Position the cursor on the desired amount
  and click on the left button.

* The temple is the only place in which you can store and keep the jewels you
  find. When you find a jewel, a window appears asking you in what temple you
  want to store it. If the temple is destroyed by the enemy, all of the
  jewels stored inside will be left outisde, and accessible to anyone!

You can build several temples, but it is unnecessary to have more than one
temple on a single land. In contrast, if you have temples on other lands,
this will

- Boost the morale of your people.
- Enable you to spread the jewels you find around and thsu protect them more
  efficently.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 23 ]=====

The shop

The shop can help you increase your revenues. But to be able to benefit from
the "generosity" of the shopkeeper, you need a wagon (See PART IV, Chapter 2
- Interactive inventions).
Bring your wagon to the front of the warehouse (See PART II, Chapter 5 - The
warehouse), load it with goods, and bring your wagon to the shop. The
shopkeeper will buy whatever is in the wagon.

This will help you considerably:

* Your income will increase.
* If your warehouse is too full, you can remove some of your goods.

If you wish, you can also sell raw materials to another player.

Example:

If player 2 has a lot of money but very few raw materials (such as stone,
wood and metal), you can load your wagon and bring yoru goods to the other
player's shop. The goods in the wagon will be available in the other player's
warehouse and you will receive a sum of money. These exchanges can only take
place if there is mutual confidence. If you do not feel completely safe, we
suggest having your wagon escorted by armed soldiers to protect your goods.


Drills

Drills are crucial to the economy since they are the only way to obtain stone
and metal. Without drills you cannot build anything. Contrary to the other
buildings, you cannot go inside.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 24 ]=====

A single drill can extract both stone and metal (see PART II, Chapter 7 -
Production). But if you want to produce more stone than metal, position the
drill at the top of a mountain, and preferably on a rock. If you place a
drill at sea level, it will produce more metal than stone.

To position your drill:

- Open the construction window.
- Select the drill command.
- You must have an architect available.
- Position the cursor with the mouse to choose a production site on the game
  screen.
- Click with the left button to get your architect started on the
  construction of the drill.


Warning!

Once installed, a drill cannot be placed elsewhere.


HOUSES

Houses are where your inhanbitants live. You are not in charge of managing
their construction and your architects will decide what types of houses to
build. Depending on the type of house, your architects will get the materials
they need from your warehouse.

Warning!

Your population cannot increase ulness you have vacant homes. You must thus
let your architects freely build the homes of their choice.

However, you can interrupt the construction of a house. To do this, pen the
constructions window and select the type of building you want. The house that
is being built will be cancelled and will be replaced by your order.


Different types of houses:

* Huts and cabins

Huts and cabins are the most primitive of hosuing. As long as your land is
still as a primitive stage of development, your architects will build this
type of house which requires no raw material input. The drawback is that they
can only house one person.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 25 ]=====

* Small farms, Houses and Inns

These are better quality lodgings that can house two people, making marriages
possible and therefore a larger population.


DEFENSIVE BUILDINGS

These buildings protect you from an enemy attack.
They must be built by your architects.


Stone walls

You can build stone walls around towns, sites, or buildings that you feel
need special protection (for example, a temple).
Building a wall will cost raw materials as well as some money.


Portcullises

Once you have built a rampart (i.e., 2 walls side by side) you can install a
portcullis. This is a major advantage since by clicking on it with the mouse,
you can open the portcullis to let your armies in or out. Click again on the
portcullis to close it and prevent enemy armies from penetrating your land.



Chapter 6 - CONSTRUCTIONS

INSTANT BUILDINGS

So-called "instant" buildings are those that involve no work by architects.
These include roads, wells and fields which can be created simply by clicking
on the mouse. There is no construction delay.
However, these constructions will cost money which will be automatically
taken from your coffers, as well as raw materials which are needed for wells
and roads. Instant buildings are represented by an "I" in the construction
window.

General rules concerning instant constructions

- To launch a construction, open the constructions window.
- To do this, click on the anvil icon in the window at the bottom of the
  screen; a window with the list of constructions will appear.
- The figure on the right is the cost of the building.
- Place the cursor on the construction you are interested in. The cost of the
  construction in raw materials will be displayed.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 26 ]=====

Click with the left-hand button of the mouse to confirm your choice.

- The chosen construction will appear in the "in progress" window (see main
  screen).
- Once you have chosen the cnstruction you want to build, select where you
  want the construction to be placed. Position the cursor on the game map and
  click with the left-hand button to confirm the position.
- You must own the land on which you plan to build (see main screen).

Example:

To build a road, open the construction window; using the mouse, place the
cursor on "Road". A new window will appear which will indicate the cost in
raw materials. Click with the left-hand button to confirm.


Roads

When you travel in GENESIA you use up travel points (see PART III, Chapter 5,
Travel points). Roads make it easier for your armies or wagons to get from
one point to another, by cutting in half the number of travel points needed.

Roads have one main advantage: they facilitate exchanges between your lands.
Thus, if you own several lands, connecting them with roads and crossroads
saves your travel points.

It is impossible to build roads over mountains or over the sea.


Wells

Wells provide drinking water which is drawn from the underground reserves. If
you dig too many wells, yu risk drying up the underground water supplies.



Warning!

Too many wells will tie up the underground water reserves (see PART II,
Chapter 4 - Sesons and vegetation).


Fields

These enable farmers to grow crops. You must have at least as many fields as
farmers.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 27 ]=====

COMPLEX CONSTRUCTIONS

Contrary to instant constructions, complex cnstructions require the work of
an architect.


Ordered Buildings

These are the buildings that you must specifically order (e.g., barracks,
drills, etc.). The architect will follow your orders and will build the
constructions you ask for. If no architect is available, a message will
appear on the screen.


General rules concerning building oredrs placed with an architect:

- First open the construction window.
- To do this, click on the icon representing an anvil in the window at the
  bottom of the game screen; a window will appear with the list of buildings.
- The buildings cost is indicated on the right.
- To know the cost in raw materials, place the cursor on the building of your
  choice, a window will appear indicating the consumption of raw materials
  for each unit.
- Click on the left button of the mouse to confirm your selection.
- The icon representing the building you have chosen will appear in the
  window (see main screen).


Warning!

You must have an architect available:

- Once you have chosen the type of building, choose the location by moving
  the cursor on the game map to the point on which you want the building
  constructed and clock on the left-hand button to confirm.
- You must own the land on which you plan to build.

The following buildings require an architect (see PART II, Chapter 5 -
Buildings for a detailed description of each type of building): barracks,
workshops, taverns, shops, warehouses and stone walls.


Autonomous buildings

These are the buildings that the architects build on their own, i.e., houses.
An architect will build houses if the following conditions are met:

- Economic conditions are favourable.
- The warehouse contains enough raw materials.
- The architect is healthy.
- No other construction order has been given at the beginning of the season.

Chapter 7 - PRODUCTION AND STORAGE

Production and storage are the keys to victory. Your inhabitants will produce
the supplies and materials you need to develop your economy.


PRODUCTION

Note: See also chapter on trades.

Food and water

* Your families cultivate your fields and store the fruit of their labour
  themselves in the warehouse.
* When you dig wells, these draw water from underground water resources.
  Drinking water is stored directly in the warehouse. The inhabitants of the
  land draw the amount of food and water they need. If there is a famine, a
  message from your inhabitants will appear on screen.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 29 ]=====

Raw materials

* Wood
  ~~~~
To produce wood (a necessary component of all buildings) you need to call in
your woodsmen and carpenters. Your woodsmen will choose which trees to cut
down. Once their task is accomplished, the carpenters will work on the tree
trunks. When they are finished, the wood is stored directly in the warehouse
where it becomes available for your architects. If you run out of wood, a
message will appear on the screen.

* Stone and metal
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Production of these materials is determined by the position of the drill.
Both are produced with a drill. If you want more stone than metal, place your
drill at the top of a mountain, preferably on a rock.

If you place your drill at sea level, it will tend to produce more metal than
stone.

All materials extracted are stored in the warehouse. If you run out of stone
or metal, a message will appear on screen.


Specialties

Specialists work at home. They produce pottery, pearls, fruit and fabrics.
Stocks of these items in your warehouse will increase at the end of each
season.

Pearls, pottery and fruit can only be sold in the shop. Fabric has other
uses. It can be:

- Sold like another speciality to the shopkeeper.
- Stored to produce certain inventions like the balloon (see PART V, Chapter
  2 - The balloon).

Each land has its own speciality. This can be pottery, pearls, fruit or
fabric. The specialist will produce twice as much of the lands speciality
than of the other three Specialities.

Example:

The speciality of your land is fabric. If at the end of the season, if your
specialist produces 3 units of fruit, three units of pearls and 3 units of
pottery, he will produce 6 units of fabric.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 30 ]=====

STORAGE


Warehouses

As you have already guessed, to store the output of a land you must have at
least one warehouse. Each warehouse has a storage capacity of 500 units. When
you enter the warehouse, the figure in the top right hand corner indicates
the units used up. With each new warehouse you build, your overall storage
capacity increases by 500 units.

Example:

If you have two warehouses on a land, your Total Storage Capacity (T.S.C.)
will increase to 1,000 units.

The warehouse is emptied as:

* Raw materials are used up for construction.
* Food and water are consumed by inhabitants.
* Some goods are carried out by the wagon.

Be careful not to overstock
When a warehouse is full, any surplus production i slost. This means your
farmers, woodsmen and carpenters work for nothing.

Solutions:

- de-stock goods using the wagon
- build a new warehouse
- stop producing



Chapter 8 - MONEY

As in any game, economic strategy plays a critical role. It is very important
to manage your money. You have to keep track of what you spend and what you
earn.

YOUR EXPENSES

Your capital diminishes with each of the following developments:

* Cost of constructon: Each time you launch a construction, a certain amount
  is deducted from your capital.
* Purchasing goods from another player: If you have a shop and another
  players sells his

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 31 ]=====

  goods in one of your stores, your stock increases, but some money will be
  deducted. 
* Paying your blacksmiths: This happens every time something is invented.
* Making an offering to the temple: This increases the morale of your people
  and the fertility of your land.
* Buying information on the jewels: These are the bribes you must pay the
  adventurers in the tavern.


YOUR REVENUES

* Taxes: At the beginning of the spring, the inhabitants of your land pay
  their taxes. The more inhabitants, the more taxes.
* Selling goods to the shop: Selling goods to the shopkeeper increases your
  revenues.
* Selling goods to another player: First negotiate with another player to
  sign a trade pact.
* Bonuses: In the world of GENESIA, one can receive a bonus for a remarkable
  deed.



Chapter 9 - THE BALANCE SHEET

The balance sheet is divided into two parts. The sheet called BALANCE 1
provides visual indications represented by gauges. The sheet called BALANCE 2
provides the same indications, but stated in figures. BALANCE 2 also provides
the average performances of each land, including water and food reserves.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 32 ]=====

- for each land: this shows your position for each of the components of your
  land (water, wood, metal, etc.)
- the average of your lands: in Balance 2, click on 'Average'.
- forecasts: you can easily manage your water and food needs based on the
  indications provided by reserves (see Balance 2)

Example:

-  Food = 4 seasons
-> This means you have enough food to feed your people during the next four
   seasons.

-  Drinking water = 2 seasons
-> This means you have enough drinking water for the next two seasons.

These indications are very important because they tell you if yur reserves of
water and food are sufficient or if you must produce more.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 33 ]=====

PART III: THE ARMIES

Chapter 1 - DIFFERENT TYPES OF ARMIES

What You Need to Know:

Armies vary according to:

- Potential action points.
- Potential attack points.
- Potential defense points.
- Ability to use projectiles.

SOLDIERS

Soldiers are the smallest unit of army. At the beginning of the game, before
you have invented anything, your soldiers have no additional attack or
defense points. As the game progresses (with the help of your inventors), you
will strengthen your soldiers by supplying them with very sophisticated
weapons and protection.


ARCHERS

Once you have invented projectiles, you will be able to hire archers. Several
types of launch weapons can be invented (see PART V, Chapter 1, Inventions).
Archers have the considerable advantage of being able to strike the enemy at
a distance.

To fire a projectile:

- Place the cursor on the archer.
- Click the right button of the mouse, a multiple-choice window opens.
- Select the "FIRE" option.
- Place the cursor on the target.
- Click to confirm.


Warning!
When you shoot a projectile, sction points will be deducted (See PART III,
CHAPTER 4, Action points).


HORSEMEN

Once you have invented the strap, you can move about on horseback which has
the

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 34 ]=====

advantage of using only one action point per field square (instead of two
movement points for soldiers and archers). Horsemen move twice as fast as
foot soldiers.


KNIGHTS

Knights are the most efficient troops, since they travel on horseback and are
also better protected (because of their coat of mail - which you have to
invent). They also have a greater attack potential than other troops.


Chapter 2 - HOW TO RECRUIT AN ARMY

WHERE TO RECRUIT AN ARMY

To recruit an army:

- You must have available settlers (See PART II, CHAPTER 3).
- You must have barracks.
- You must have a sufficient number of gold coins to pay for their
  enlistment.

If these conditions are filled:

- Click with the right mouse button on the barracks.
- Click on the administrator, the person seated behind the table.
  (Position the cursor on the administrator, then click the right button of
  the mouse)

Three messages will appear on the screen:

- Change the tax rate.
- Recruit an army.
- Offer an alliance.

Click on "Recruit an army"
The administrator will then ask what tupe of army you wish to enlist.

- Select the desired type of army (soldiers are always available even at the
  beginning of the game).
- According to the number of settlers you have on the field, the
  administrator will offer a certain number of men available for enlistment.
- Click on the desired number.
- A certain amount of money will be asked to pay the recruits.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 35 ]=====

- Click on the message "Here are your gold coins."
- If you do not have enough money, click on the message "I do not have enough
  gold coins."


WHO CAN BE ENLISTED?

You can enlist only the inhabitants of your own land, providing they are in
good health.


HOW TO DEMOBILISE A SOLDIER

Place the soldier(s) on the square next to the barracks in which he (they)
was (were) enlisted.

- Click on the right button of the mouse, a multiple choice window will
  appear.
- Select "DEMOBOLISE".
- You will find your ex-soldiers amoing the settlers.


Chapter 3 - CHARACTERISTICS

LIFE POINTS

Your armies are made up of men and women. Their life points depend on their
morale.

Example:

You have decided to recruit a farmer with a morale of 6 out of 7 (6/7).
Open the trades window and place the figure of the farmer with the 6/7 morale
in the sttlers column. The soldier you will latter recruit will have
thereafter six life points, in proportion to his morale as a farmer, then as
a colonist which was six.


ATTACK POINTS

Attack points determine the amount of damage done to an adversary when he is
hit. If the attack potential is of three, these destruction points will vary
from 1 to 3 when youstrike your adversary. In GENESIA you will find that your
soldiers - according to their class - will have different attack potentials.
At the beginning of the game, your armies will only have daggers and nothing
to protect them.

As you progress in the game and more specifically in the development of your
inventions, you will be able to increase the attack potential of your troops.
Thus with more effective weapons such as the sword, the rapier, and in
particular the broadsword, the soldiers' attack potential will increase
considerably.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 36 ]=====

DEFENSE POINTS

Defense points follow the same principle as attack points. The only
difference is tha they determine the extent to which your armies are
protected from attacks. By inventing armours such as the breast plate, the
coat of mail and the armour, you will greatly increase your armies' defense
potential.


Chapter 4 - MOVING AROUND

To Move a Unit:

- Click on the desired unit with the left button of the mouse.
- Place the cursor of the mouse on the dsired destination.
- Click with the left button on the mouse to confirm.

Warning!

The distance must represent no more than your total action points, otherwise
it is not taken into account.


MOVEMENT POINT

For a unit to move, it must use movement points. These points will be
deducted from the action points displayed on the sign (See PART VII,
Screens). Action points allow the movement of both military and civilian
units, such as carts, cannons, boats and balloons. At the beginning of a
turn, a certain number of action points are given for each unit. When a
unit's number of action points is used up by a movement, a message will let
you know. Wait for the next turn (the following season) to move again.


DISPLAY OF MOVEMENT POINTS

The number of movement points absorbed depends of the type of terrain on
which your units are travelling. The best way to move units is to use roads.
Plains should be crossed because of the low demand on movement points.
Mountains and sand (beaches) require the most movement points.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 37 ]=====

Forests

Demand 3 movement points to enter but offer the strategic advantage of
camouflaging your armies by making them invisible to the enemy. Warning: the
opposite is quite possible. To find out if an army is hidden in the forest,
simply move a unit to the edge of the forest.


The Sea

With the invention of the boat, you can move on the seas and save many
movement points.


The Air

The skies will be accessible with the invention of the balloon: the ultimate
weapon, as well as a means of espionage and movement in GENESIA.



Chapter 5 - MOVEMENT BONUSES

During the game you will have several opportunities to gain extra movement
points.

EXPERIENCE

How you play GENESIA will be assessed as the game advances. Thus when you
successfully carry out certain actions, if your expansion is well managed, if
your people are happy with their king, if..., certain experience points are
given. The experience points are represented on the screen by pieces of the
Abora Globe displayed on the game screen. With every new piece of the globe,
you will receive movement, money or raw materials bonuses.


INVENTIONS (see PART IV, Inventions)

Inventions are crucial to increase the number of your movement points as well
as to make your armies more efficient, more aggressive and more resistant. We
suggest you consult the chapter on inventions to study closely the
correlationbetween certain inventions and their advatages for your armies.



Chapter 6 - FORMATIONS

A formation is made up of several units which have been brought together to
be more agressive during a battle.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 38 ]=====

MERGING SEVERAL ARMIES

To merge several units you must place them on adjacent squares. Click on one
of the units with the left button of the mouse. A window will appear with the
option "ENLIST". Select this option to merge the companies.


Advantages of a formation:

- The movement of several small units grouped into one bigger units becomes
  more efficient.
- The life points, the attack points and the defense points of all the units
  are combined. The formation becomes an important attack entity.


BREAKING UP A GROUP OF ARMIES

To break up a formation of units click on the formation with the left button
of the mouse. A window will appear with the option "DIVIDE". Select this
option to break up a formation.

Drawbacks of a formation:

- You cannot spread your men.
- The damage from enemy projectiles (arrows, cannonballs...) will be more
  extensive on a formation than on individual units.



Chapter 7 - CAPTURES

UNITS YOU CAN CAPTURE

You can capture enemy units and take them over. You can only capture wagons
and cannons.


HOW TO MAKE A CAPTURE

To do this, you must surround the enemy unit with two of your own units.



Chapter 8 - EMBLEMS

MEANING OF EMBLEMS

An emblem is the flag located in the centre of a land. To conquer a land, you
must position one of your armies on an adjacent square.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 39 ]=====

COLOURS

To identify the (potential) owner of the land you wish to conquer, place the
cursor on the area and glance at the colour of the flag represented at the
top of the game screen next to the mini-map (see PART VII, Chapter 2 - World
screen). Depending on the colour of the flag, you know who controls the land.

White corresponds to player number 1.
Yellow, to player number 2.
Blue, to player number 3.



Chapter 9 - LANDS

REPRESENTATION OF LANDS

GENESIA'S various maps are displayed om the screen at a 45 degree angle.

The large map

The main map shown at the beginning of the game (or by clicking on the
"planet" icon on the playing screen) shows the world in which you will find
yourself, with its mountains, its plains and its seas. The players'
territories are represented by the colour of their emblems. When you press
one of these emblems, you will be placed on its land. All the maps of the
world are divided into 64 squares, 8 squares high by 8 squares wide. Each
square represents a land with plains, mountains, forests, lakes, seas, etc.

The map of the game screen (see PART VII, Chapter 1)

This map represents the main field in GENESIA: it is your area of activity.
It represents a portion of a land. Each area is divided into 256 squares, 16
squares high by 16 squares long. In each of these squares, you can find a
square of plain, or a tree; you can place a field or erect a building.

The mini-map of the game screen (see PART VII, Chapter 1)

This mini-map is placed at the top of the screen. It gives a general view of
the world. Clicking on the button at the edge of the mini-map opens or closes
the information mode. When the information mode is open, the boundaries of
each land are displayed and the name of each object is given. Example: If you
place the cursor on a tree, a message will tell you if it is a palm, a poplar
or a fir tree.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 40 ]=====

The mini-map is also very useful for moving from one land to another.

Example:

You are on a land placed on the upper left hand corner of the mini-map, you
would like to see a land placed in the lower right hand corner. Position the
mouse cursor on the mini-map and click on the desired land. The main game
screen will display the land you are interested in.

Note:

The white area shown in the mini-map is the area displayed on the main
screen. Your land is represented on the mini-map by the colour of your
emblem.


TO CONQUER A LAND


Unclaimed Land

By definition, unclaimed land belongs to none of the players. To take over
unclaimed land, place one of your troops on a square adjacent to the emblem
of the land you wish to conquer. Click on the army which is next to the
emblem with the right button of the mouse. A window will appear with several
options including "CONQUER TERRITORY" and "COLONISE". Choose "CONQUER
TERRITORY." You have acquired a new land. (See PART III, CHAPTER 10,
Colonisation).

Land conquered by another player

When the land belongs to one of the other two players, matters become more
complicated because you will have to confront the adversary who owns the
land. To take the land, place one of your troops on the square next to the
emblem of the land. Place the mouse cursor on the soldier next to the emblem
then click the right button of the mouse.



Chapter 10 - COLONISATION

DEFINITION

Colonisation is the step following the conquest of an unclaimed land. By
colonising a land, you can develop its economy. When one of your troops is
placed on the square next to the land's emblem, click with the left button of
the mouse on the soldier. A window is displayed offering the choice between
"CONQUER TERRITORY" and "COLONISE".

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 41 ]=====

Click on COLONISE

The colonising army immediately turns into an architect. This architect
builds a hut and moves in as soon as the hut is finished. Once he has a home,
the architect moves out of his original land into the new land. He is no
longer part of the population of his former land.


ADVICE FOR COLONISATION

- As soon as your architect has built his house, you should build a
  warehouse.
- Let at least one architect build houses to attract possible travellers who
  can become settlers.
- Colonise a land where the land is fertile, the vegetation lush and the
  water table high.
- Colonise land next to your land with a large population and stockpiles.
  Your architects will go build houses themselves on the new colony.



Chapter 11 - BATTLES

During the battle, you have no control over the actions of the troops, but
you can measure the strength of your adversary by placing the mouse cursor on
the enemy army and clicking the right button of the mouse. If you decide to
attack, evaluate your chances of winning.


HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT

Hand-to-hand combat is represented by a cloud of dust and battle sound
effects. Place the cursor on the square on which the battle is taking place.
This displays a battle table with infrmation on the forces present (type of
unit, total troops, total number of life points, etc.).

Engaging combat

To engage hand-to-hand combat, place an army on a square adjacent to that of
an enemy unit. Click on your army with the left button of the mouse and
select 'ATTACK'.


Difference between attacker and defender

The advantage of attacking is important since you maintain the option of
"RETREAT". Place the mouse cursor on the square on which the battle is taking
place; click with the left button of the mouse. Click on "RETREAT" when it is
displayed and you will leave the battlefield, saving the men who are still
alive.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 42 ]=====

The battle

- During the battle the adversaries strike one at a time until one of the two
  parties dies or runs off.
- When an army launches an attack, it inflicts a certain amount of damage to
  its adversary.
- The attack is represented by a fist which appears in the attacking party's
  section of the table. A figure shows the amount of damage done.
- After that, the army which has received the attack gets to strike back.

A unit made up of several men has as many life points and attack points as
the total of the men that compose it.

Example:

A soldier with 7 life points and 2 soldiers wih 5 life points each, will make
three soldiers with seventeen life points.


Description of the battle table

The battle table displays the array of forces, distinguishing soldiers,
archers, horsemen and knights. Each group has a specific area displaying the
number of men (Example: 2 soldiers, 1 archer, 2 horsemen, 0 knights). On the
lower right hand dside of the table is a gauge reprsenting the total number
of life points.


COMBAT AT A DISTANCE

This includes attacks by archery units. Whenever an enemy unit enters the
action area of one of your archery units, you can fire an arrow. This is an
important advantage since you can damage the stock of life points and
possibly destroy them without being hit. Thus, if the enemy is not destroyed
and at the next turn he decides to go hand-to-hand, he will be considerably
weakened.

Warning!

Firing an arrow will deduct action points in proportion to the distance of
the shot.


Steps to follow:

- Click on your archery unit with the left button of the mouse.
- Place the mouse cursor on the target.
- Click with the left button of the mouse to confirm and fire.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 43 ]=====

Warning!

The distance of the shot must not be greater than your number of action
points.

- Archers are capable of fighting hand-to-hand, but they are less effective
  than other troops such as soldiers.
- If a battle is not going well for your men, and if your archers are near
  the battle square, they can fire arrows onto the square. Thus you can cause
  damage to the enemy fighting hand-to-hand, although your men run the risk
  of being hit in the crossfire.


REINFORCEMENTS

If a battle is not going well and you have other units nearby, you can bring
them to the battle as reinforcements. They will appear in the numbers on the
battle.

Steps to follow:

- Establish the battle square on which one of your enemies is fighting.
- Move the unit you want to send into battle (for movement, follow the
  standard procedure).
- When your troops are on the adjacent square place the mouse cursor on the
  unit, click on "ATTACK" with the left button of the mouse.



Chapter 12 - ALLIANCES

PRINCIPLE

GENESIA is played by three people. Often, one of the three becomes stronger
than the other two. When it seems that one of the other two captains is
becoming dangerous, a player can propose an alliance with the third player.
You can approach any player to suggest an alliance, regardless of whether the
character is played by the computer or by a person. An alliance includes:

A non-aggression pact:

- The allies may neither engage in combat nor conquer each other's land.
- A player will not capture cannons or carts belonging to the ally.

A commercial pact:

- Allies can eaisly do budiness together (you can send a wagon into allied
  land without the risk of it being captured).

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 44 ]=====

Duration of the pact:

- An alliance is valid for a certain number of seasons (usually 8).
- If one of the allies does not respect the agreements above, the alliance is
  immediately broken.


TO PROPOSE AN ALLIANCE


* You must have barracks:

- Click on the barracks with the right button.
- Click on the administrator.
- Click on the message that says "OFFER AN ALLIANCE".
- Indicate the player with which you want to strike an alliance by clicking
  on the cursor corresponding to his flag.

-> At the end of your turn, the player you have approached will give you his
   answer.



PART IV: INVENTIONS - GENERAL INFORMATION

Chapter 1 - INTRODUCTION

ADVANTAGES OF INVENTIONS

As you have probably guessed, inventions open the way to victory. With
invention your basic soldier becomes a brave and powerful warrior, new units
(archers, horsemen, knights) join your armies, you will find vaccines to
fight epidimics, Wagons, boats and balloons will carry you across the world
of GENESIA.

PRINCIPLES OF INVENTIONS

To create inventions, you must employ inventors who will study the Great Book
of Knowledge to discover valuable secrets. Over 70 inventions can be
developed.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 45 ]=====

Chapter 2 - CONDITIONS

THE WORKSHOP

There must be at least one workshop in a land (See PART II, CHAPTER 5, The
Workshop). The more workshops there are in the same land, the more your
inventions will progress rapidly.

If you have several lands, and you have built workshops in them, you can
diversify the development of your inventions.

Example:

The inventors of the workshops in land X are learning "WOODWORKS" while those
in land Y are learning "METALWORK". When the inventors in X discover
woodworks, it will be accessible to the workshops in land Y, even though they
have not discovered it themselves.

An invention created in one land is valid for all lands.


THE INVENTOR

The more inventors you have, the more rapidly inventions will progress. The
morale of an inventor is taken into account. An inventor with a morale of 7/7
will find his inventions faster than an inventor with a morale of 3/7.

To launch an invention, see PART II, CHAPTER 5, The workshop.

Reminder:

- Click on the workshop of your land.
- Click on ENTER on the displayed window.
- Click on the inventor in the centre of the workshop.
- Click on the invention in the list that you want.

REMEMBER: the discoivery of an invention is valid for all territories.

Example:

You have just invented the sword in land X. You control lands A, B and C. All
soldiers in lands X, A, B and C will be equipped with swords (provided each
of these territories have barracks).

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 46 ]=====

THE BLACKSMITH

Blacksmiths can only build wagons, cannons, boats and balloons. Like
inventors, the more blacksmiths there are, the faster their work is done.
Blacsmiths require raw materials and gold coins.

If you have invented the cannon, the blacksmiths will buidl one, if you ahve
what they require. There will be a delay for the construction. The length of
the delay depends on the number or workshops and blacksmiths, as well as one
their morale.

To place an order with the blacksmiths, see PART II, CHAPTER 5, The Workshop.

Reminder:

- Check in the population window to see if you have at least one blacksmith.
- Click on the workshop in your land.
- Click on ENTER in the displayed window.
- Click on the blacksmith at the anvil to see if he is available or not (if
  not, he will tell you what he is building).

The blacksmith will describe what he can build (name of the construction ,
price, necessary raw materials), a previous invention. If you are not
satisfied with what he has to offer, click on the message at the bottom of
the workshop: "OTHER". If another construction is available, the blacksmith
will offer you something else. If there is something to your liking, click
"YES" at the bottom of the workshop. If there is nothing you like, or if you
do not have the means to make what you wish, click "NO".


Chapter 3 - THE TABLE OF INVENTIONS

DESCRIPTION

The table lists more than 70 inventions. There is a general index at the end
of this manual, but you should refer to it only when you have played GENESIA
long enough. Thus, you will discover your inventions along with your
inventors. There are two categories of inventions. When you load the
inventiosn table, you will be on the "CRAFTS" page. When you click on the
right button of the mouse, the "SCIENCES" page will appear.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 47 ]=====

Example:

Before inventing the cannon (in metalwork), you will have to have invented
gunpowder in "SCIENCES" (See CHEMISTRY branch, after explosives).


READING THE TABLE

You can only discover:

- New inventions derived from previous ones and within a same branch.
- Inventions which do not require another, intermediate invention.

Once something has been invented, it is crossed out. While something is being
developed, a yellow light bulb appears over it. Once an invention is
available, its name becomes apparent. Inventions that are not yet available
are in grey.


ORGANISATION

Organise your inventions in the most strategically effective manner possible.

Example:

You control lands A, B and C. You need an invention which requires three
steps. Ask the workshops in land A to develop step 1, those in land B to
develop step 2 and those in C to develop step 3. Thus the work can be divided
to obtain your invention as quickly as possible.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 48 ]=====

PART V: INVENTIONS - THE LIST

Chaper 1 - SOME INFORMATION

* Disocvery of the microscope and the test tube

  Epidimics can decimate your people. By inventing the microscope, you can
  identify the several viruses and, with the test tube, you can develop
  vaccines. These vaccines will immunise the populations of all your
  territories.


* Invention of the telescope and the compass

  These are essential inventions for building boats and balloons. They will
  enable your troops to see (telescope) and navigate (compass) better, which
  saves movement points. The telescope can also help your spies.


* Discovery of metals

  With the science of metals and alloys, you will discover 4 different
  metals, each will be essential for further inventions.


* Invention of fertilisers and of the lightning rod

  Fertilisers will greatly enhance crops, but will dry the soil and lower the
  water table. The lightning rod will protect against lightning, which will
  invariably strike your territories during the summer.


* Invention of the bomb

  The bomb will destroy any construction belonging to the players and can be
  dropped from balloons.


* Invention of the sling, the arc and the crossbow

  The invention of one of these weapons enables the enlistment of archers.


* Invention of the blade, the sword, the rapier and the broadsword

  According to the weapon invented, your troops will be more or less
  effective in combat.


* Invention of the strap

  The strap enables you to enlist horsemen.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 49 ]=====

* Invention of the breastplate, the coat of mail and plate armor

  These inventions are of the utmost importance in your campaigns. If you
already have the strap, the coat of mail enables you to enlist knights.



Chapter 2 - INTERACTIVE INVENTIONS

Interactive inventions are the only inventions your blacksmith can make, as
well as the only inventions you can work on yourself.


THE WAGON

Once you have invented and built a wagon, you can use it to:

- Supply one of your warehouses on any of your land to increase your stock of
  food or raw materials.
- If you own a shop, you can increase your supply of gold coins by selling
  some of the supplies stored in your warehouses.
- If you have a non-aggression pact with another player who owns a shop, you
  may trade with this player by selling your supplies.


Using the wagon:

- Click on the wagon with the left button of the mouse.
- Place the cursor on the destination.
- Click with the left button to confirm.

Warning!

The distance travelled cannot exceed the number of action points you have.

Using the wagon with the warehouse

You can use a wagon to sell supplies stored in your warehouse to a shop or to
re-supply another warehouse. Place the wagon in front of the warehouse, enter
the warehouse by clicking with the right button of the mouse.

- Load supplies stored in your warehouse onto the wagon.
  Place the cursor on the goods you wish to load onto the wagon and click
  with the left button of the mouse. The number of units in the wagon
  increases as the units stored in the warehouse diminish.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 50 ]=====

- Unload the contents of the wagon in the warehouse.
  Place the cursor on the goods you wish to unload from the wagon into the
  warehouse and click on the right button of the mouse. The number of units
  in the wagon diminishes as the number of units in the warehouse increases.

When the wagon is full you can leave the warehouse. Click on the wagon with
the right button, a window describing the freight carried by the wagon
appears.


Using the wagon in front of the shop

Place the wagon in front of the shop and click on the shop. The shopkeeper
will buy the contents of your wagon.

A full wagon can be driven to another land or its contents unloaded onto a
ship (if you own one).


THE CANNON

One shot of a cannon is usually enough to entirely dstroy the target. You can
thus level walls, annihilate trops, etc.

Advice:

If you spot a cannon approaching one of your formations grouped onto one
square, quickly split into several units so the cannon can only hit one unit
at a time.

Using the cannon

* To move the cannon from one place to another:

- Click on the cannon with the left button of the mouse.
- In the menu: select "MOVE".
- Position the cursor on the desired destination.

THE BOAT

A boat will enable you:

- To travel quickly.
- To attack your enemy from the coast, provided you have placed troops on
  board.
- To bomb the enemy with a cannon on board.
- To explore islands which are inaccessible without a boat.

Using the boat

Click on your boat with the right button of the mouse, a window will appear,
informing you of the state of the vessel as well as its cargo. Everything on

  land).
- Move the unit to the square of beach next to the boat.
- Click on the unit with the left button of the mouse.
- On the menu, select 'EMBARK'.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 52 ]=====

- Click on the left button of the mouse to put the unit on board.

If an army, wagon or cannon are brought on board:

Click on the boat with the left button of the mouse; a menu will appear with
the following options: MOVE, FIRE, DIEMBARK.

- FIRE: fire the cannon as explained above.
- DISEMBARK: after selecting this option, choose the unit which you wish to
  disembark.


THE BALLOON

The balloon is the ultimate weapon in GENESIA. It requires the fewest number
of points for the greatest distance of travel. Nothing can be brought on
board a balloon, however, if you have invented the bomb, you can bomb the
enemy.

If you have not invented the bomb:

To move a balloon from one place to another:

- Click on the balloon's shadow with the left button of the mouse.
- Place the cursor on the desired destination.
- Click on the left button of the mouse to confirm.


Warning!

The distance of travel cannot exceed the number of action points you have.


If you have invented the bomb

- Click on the balloon's shadow with the left button of the mouse.

-> A menu appears with the following options: "DROP BOMB" or "MOVE".

- Select "DROP BOMB" with the left button of the mouse to bombard the enemy.

-> The bomb falls directly bellow the balloon and hits what is in the
   balloon's shadow.

To move your balloon, select "MOVE".

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 53 ]=====

PART VI: THE JEWELS

Chapter 1 - HOW TO DISCOVER THE JEWELS

You must recover the 7 jewels. The jewels will be found by your armies. To
take possession of the jewels, you must first find them, then place soldiers
on a square adjacent to the one with the jewels. Once the unit is next to the
jewel, click on the army with the left button. A window appears containing
the following option 'TAKE JEWEL'. Once your army is near a jewel, a message
will appear on screen. All you have to do is place your group in the vicinity
of the jewel.


Chapter 2 - PROSPECTING

Before you have the joy of discovering the jewels, you will have to send
troops to the four corners of GENESIA to explore as many territories as
possible. Recruit soldiers among your settlers, then send them as far as
possible.


Chapter 3 - THE TAVERN

Description of the tavern

The tavern will be of great help to you in your search. Many adventurers go
there for food and drink. Most are nomads who belong to no land in
particular. If a jewel is in the vicinity of the land on which the tavern is
located, they can give you valuable information in exchange for money.

Procedure:

- Click with the right-hand button of the mouse on the tavern. (you must
  previously have built one on your land - (See PART II, Chapter 5 -
  CONSTRUCTIONS - The tavern).
- Click with the left-hnd button of the mouse on an adventurer (i.e, the
  characters seated at the table. Caution: they are not in the tavern at
  all times).

-> To the question: "That all depends on your purse", click on the message
   corresponding to the amount you wish to pay at the bottom of the screen.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 54 ]=====

Two solutions are possible:

1) There are no jewels in the area. The adventurer will tell you this but
   only after he is paid.
2) The adventurer knows where to find the jewels. In this case, a map
   centred on the tavern will be displayed with the position of the jewels.

Depending on the amount you pay, the information you receive will be more or
less accurate - or completely false.

Advice

You own lands A, B and C. A tavern is located on land A. If you learn from an
adventurer in your tavern on land A that there are no jewels in the vicinity
(assuming the information is true), but remember to build taverns on lands B
and C and to question the adventurers of these lands.



Chapter 4 - GUARDING THE JEWELS

The temple is the only place where you can store your jewels:

YOU HAVE NO TEMPLE

As you prepare to take a jewel, if you have no temple, a mesage will appear
on screen to inform you that you cannot take the jewel. You can always leave
an armed unit near the jewel to protect it from an enemy. Build a temple as
soon as possible on one of your lands to put the stone in a safe place.

YOU HAVE ONLY ONE TEMPLE

You own land A and you have built a temple on it. When you take the stone, a
window will appear indicating that the stone will be stored in the temple on
land A.

YOU HAVE SEVERAL TEMPLES

You own lands A, B and C and have a temple on each. When you take the stone,
a message will appear asking where you want to store the stone you have just
discovered. You have the choice between temple A, B or C.

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 55 ]=====

Chapter 5 - CAPTURING THE JEWELS OF ANOTHER CAPTAIN

The other way to get jewels is to take those of another player.

IF THE OTHER PLAYER DOES NOT HAVE A TEMPLE

Spot the troops which are likely to be guarding the jewels. Send a
sufficiently well-armed unit to capture the jewel.

IF THE OTHER PLAYER HAS ONE OR MORE TEMPLES

This is somewhat trickier: you must first find the temples likely to contain
jewels. Then you must destroy the temples. This can only be done with a
cannon or a balloon (using bombs).

Once you have dstroyed the temple with jewels, you will find the jewels
somewhere on the land. It will be easy to take them. The other way is to
conquer the land on which the temple is located. The temple then belongs to
you along with the jewels it contains.

PART X: ADVICE FOR BEGINNERS

The following advice corresponds to one of the strategies experimented by us
and which will enable you to achieve maximum growth in the world of GENESIA.
This is not the only solution. There are many other ways of reaching the
ultimate goal. However, you must follow certain rules when you face your
adversaries.

There are three essential goals in the very beginning of the game. These are:

1) Building a warehouse to store the materials you will need throughoutthe
   game.

2) Pumping enough drinking water from underground reserves to satisfy the
   needs of the population.

3) Hiring at least one farmer with a moral of 6 or 7 and giving him a field.

4) Since you still have very little stone and metal, you need to drill to
   construct other

=====[ Genesia Manual ]======================================[ Page 62 ]=====

   buildings. Hire a woodsman and once he's finished cutting down a tree,
   make him a carpenter so he can supply you with food.

5) As soon as possible, construct barracks to ward off danger.

Once you reach this stage, you must make certain decisions:

If you want to expand rapidly, let your architects build homes (but be
careful that they do not carelessly use up all of your raw materials). As a
result, your population will increase rapidly. You can then send a large
number of troops to fight the enemy. To enlist inhabitants as soldiers, you
must have enough cash because enlisting is expensive. Without money, you will
no longer be able to defend yourself efficiently, which spells imminent
defeat. If you start the game near another player, you must build up a strong
defense as quickly as possible because your enemy can lay hold of your land.
This means you must build stone walls and place troops at strategic areas.

If you are far from your rivals, you have enough time to increase your
population by focusing immediately on the construction of homes.

As for inventions, we recommend inventing the bow or the sling as quickly as
possible to protect yourself from enemy attacks thanks to projectiles. If
you are focusing on inventions you need to mobilise inventors and thus reduce
the number of men ready to fight. If you decide to favour growth through
inventions, take care not to fall prey to enemies with bigger armies. But by
inventing more powerful swords, a cannon or an armour, your armies will be
particularly efficient. Invent vaccinations as quickly as possible to prevent
your men from being rendered incapable of working or of defending your land.

Last but not least, remember to build a temple as soon as possible since
this is the only place in which you can store the jewels you find.

We still have plenty of advice to give you, but we will stop here to leave
you the pleasure of discovering GENESIA and of applying your own strategy. We
hope you will spend as many pleasurable hours in the company of GENESIA and
we thank you for your confidence in choosing a MICROIDS product.
