                              INTRODUCTION
                              ============                                 

Williams moved slowly in the half light of the barricaded storeroom. 
This was the place he had hidden the radio transmitter two months 
previous at the beginning of his operation. Becoming a part of 
the German Military Underground had been a difficult task but after 
several weeks of searching and darkened alley encounters the blond 
haired American spy finally gained entry to the Underground elite. 
They took him to where they had set up a base of operations far outside 
any city in an abandoned mining shaft. Since then Williams had learned 
of the evil Baron Von Max and his plans to dominate the world with a 
deadly doomsday device. He called it the Tower of Armageddon and wanted 
to succeed where the Nazi War Machine had failed. 

Stepping up to a series of bare shelves Williams pressed his fingers 
against a section of backboard which slid aside at his touch. The 
wooden panel looked no different from the others to either side except 
for the hollow space behind it and the small brown leather box hidden 
there. Taking the box from the space Williams crossed the room to 
a small table in one corner placed the box down and opened it 
revealing the transmitter s various controls. 

Von Max was a twisted man his dreams of an Utopian society tainted by 
evil ambition and his quest for world conquest. The doomsday device 
as powerful as it was supposed to be lacked the very thing Von Max 
strived for the most: power. Conventional energy sources were not enough 
to operate the massive machine of destruction. The evil baron had 
searched in vain almost four years trying to locate several 
mysterious crystals which contained strange energies strong enough 
to fire the tower s weapons. 

Williams flipped a switch on the side of the box and the radio 
transmitter began to hum softly. Several indicators lit up on the 
radios control panel and the spy began to turn various knobs. 

Satisfied with the numbers appearing in the displays Williams attached 
a small headset to the transmitter and placed the earpiece in his right 
ear. He then began to tap out a coded message, transmitting to his 
contact in Berlin faint beeping noises sounding with each press 
of a button. 

Somehow Von Max had finally discovered the resting places of the 
crystals and was even now readying an expeditionary force. The 
crystals lay hidden in various cities around the world and the evil 
baron would lead his elite troops to each of the cities to steal the 
crystals from wherever they might be. However Williams had one 
problem Von Max disclosed to no one the locations of the crystals. 
But the spy had learned the crystals were useless on there own. If 
even one of them was not found the rest could do nothing and the 
doomsday tower would never be used for its evil purpose. 

The transmission almost complete a scraping sound caught Williams 
attention and he froze. The spy held his breath as he listened to 
the nights darkness. Had the sound simply been the result of Williams 
strained nerves? After a moments pause he continued transmitting 
satisfied nothing lurked outside the storeroom shack. The loud crash 
of wood splintering broke the silence as the storeroom door was 
kicked in. Williams tumbled to the ground and rolled behind several 
boxes as machine gun fire tore into the room and destroyed the radio 
transmitter. The American spy clutched his head as the gun shots 
continued shaking as bullets ricocheted by. When the shots ceased the 
sound of boots scraping along the wooden floor filled the room until 
long shadows fell over Williams hiding spot. 

Get up! A thick accented voice demanded. Get up or we vill shoot you 
vair you hite American cowvard!" The cocking of machine guns accompanied 
the last demand; Williams decided to stand. Six uniformed men filled 
the room's cramped interior, and in their midst stood the stout Baron 
Von Max, eyes glaring. One of the soldiers motioned with his gun and 
the spy moved forward, out from behind the bullet riddled boxes. 

Von Max looked Williams up and down, "Dis iz zee von?~ The first 
soldier nodded his head. "Zo, you are zee American zpy?" the baron spat 
the words out, "How easy it iz to find undt stop you." Von Max spoke 
quickly to his men in German and two came up beside Williams. Putting his 
hands in the air, Williams waited as the two patted his clothing, searching 
for any concealed weapons. Stopping just below the spy's knees, they 
missed the knife hidden under Williams' pant leg. 

"You Americanz are zo very foolish. Even zough you defeat our glorious 
Third Reich, you allow zee rest of uz to plot your deaths." The baron 
stepped closer with each word he spoke until he stood only a yard from 
the captured spy. Williams shifted from foot to foot, feigning fear, 
waiting for the chance to slip out the knife. "Zoon I vill have zee 
Crystals of Armageddon and zen all zee vorld vill tremble beneath 
my stare. Undt zen your puny Atomic Bomb vill be like a firecracker 
compared to my Doomzday Tower!".  Von Max raised his arms and began to 
laugh, hands clutching at the empty air. 

Williams moved quickly, knocking away the soldiers at his side before 
bending to bring out the knife. Suddenly surprised, the baron took a 
hasty step back, yelling out as Williams lunged forward aiming the 
short blade for the center of Von Max's chest. The knife fell short of 
its intended target, a moment before the fatal blow would have landed 
the remaining soldiers opened fire at the attacking spy. A barrage of 
machine gun bullets struck Williams across the legs and chest and the 
spy was thrown back by the force of the impacts to collapse against 
the crates that had hidden him. 

Von Max loomed over Williams' crumpled form. In the dim light the 
American spy could barely make out the expression of disgust that 
contorted the evil baron's face. Coughing hoarsely, blood trickling from 
his open mouth, Williams tried to speak. Curious, Von Max bent lower to 
hear the faint words. "Vhat? Speak up, I cannot hear vhat you are sayink!" 

Williams curled his lips into a snarl and spat into the baron's face. 
Enraged, Von Max straightened and brought his booted foot hard into the 
spy's ribs, kicking repeatedly until the bloodied man was dead. Turning 
back, the evil baron stormed past his men and out the doorway. Stumbling 
over themselves, the soldiers hurried to follow their master. 


                                 ---===---

Two olive garbed MP's, rifles held across their chests, stood 
guarding the conference room door. A third soldier, sitting behind a 
small, white desk, looked up at General Atterman's approach. Striding up 
the the desk, the general presented his ID card and waited impatiently as 
the seated guard stared first at the card and then down at a clip board 
resting on the tabletop. With a nod of his head the guard passed the card 
back, "You can go right in, General Atterman. The meeting has already 
started, but..." 

The general snatched back the card, "Of course I can go in." Not waiting 
for the other two guards to move aside, General Atterman pushed the door 
open and walked quickly into the Pentagon's Presidential conference Room. 
His footsteps echoed loudly, stopping all conversation as the general 
entered, hoisted his briefcase onto the conference table, and sat; hls 
chair creaked under Atterman's considerable weight. The other men sitting 
around the table, watched and waited as the general settled himself. 

~Gentleman,~ a quiet voice sounded from behind a large chair, turned away 
from the table, "Now that the Secret Service voice has arrived, might 
we continue this discussion?" Several of the other seated men chuckled 
softly and General Atterman's face turned a dark shade of red. Admiral 
Pierce cleared his throat, ~Yes, as I was saying. There Is nothing to 
substantiate the movements of the so-called threat. Not one German ship 
moving through the Mediterranean shouldn't be there..." 

~We all know how well the Navy is doing its job, Admiral," The quiet voice 
interrupted, "There is no question this Baron Von Max has begun his 
operation and that he is a threat. What I need to know is where will his 
plans take him and how will he move from place to place?" 

The admiral sat up and puffed out his chest, "Wherever this baron is 
going, he's not travelling by sea!". Beside him the, admiral's two aides 
whispered words of agreement, trying to console the aged Pierce. 

General Atterman watched impatiently as each entourage bent and spoke 
into their superior's ears. The assembled war heroes represented the 
egos of the entire American Armed Forces, and it wouldn't do to have 
the President treading on any of them. Atterman popped the clasps of his 
briefcase, the loud noise again causing all eyes to turn to him. After 
an appropriate, dramatic pause, the general spoke. 

"Sir, as you know it was one of the Secret Services' operatives who 
brought this matter to your attension," Atterman reached into the 
briefcase as he spoke and pulled out a thick file, "Although the 
particular agent gave his life to deliver the information, several other 
operatives are still in the field collecting data on Von Max's 
whereabouts and movements." As the general placed the file onto the table, 
the seated military commanders, and their various aides, began to laugh. 

Admiral Pierce spoke between guffaws, "You don't really expect us to take 
any of your secret agent spies seriously, do you?" He stopped to laugh 
again, "We all know how unreliable your agents are. Especially that big, 
brown haired one, what was his name?" One of the admiral's aides spoke 
up quickly. "Ah, yes, 'Guy Spy'. You've got to be joking?" More laughter 
accompanied the admiral's exclamation, apparently he wasn't the only one 
who found the agent's name humourous. 

General Atterman stood up, sending his chair rolling across the floor, 
~I'll have you know, Guy Spy is our best operative! Why he almost 
single-handedly wiped out the entire German Secret Agent Underground 
after the war's end..." 

~That's enough!" the quiet voice wasn't so quiet anymore. The large, 
black leather chair swivelled to face the table and President Truman 
glared at the seated men. ~I don't care where the information came from, 
or who attained it. This baron may have a device capable of making the 
A-bomb look like the Fourth of July." The president's gaze came to rest 
on General Atterman, still standing at the opposite end of the 
conference table. Truman gestured to one of his aides and the man trotted 
over to the general's chair and wheeled it back to the table. Atterman 
sat and returned the president's stare. 

"General, tell me more about this 'Guy Spy'. Leaning forward in his chair, 
the President listened intently as Atterman began to speak. If there was 
anyone who could deal with Baron Von Max, thought Truman, perhaps it was 
the super agent, Guy Spy. 

                                ---===---

The setting sun had moved below the barracks' roofs, casting long shadows 
on the patted earth of Fort George US Military Base. The approaching 
night would bring sleep and relief for most of the base's personnel, but 
not for Guy Spy. He hated sleep, when he was sleeping he was off duty 
and he hated being off duty. There wasn't enough time during the day to 
take care of all the things he had to do, much less subtracting the time 
he would spend with his eyes closed, resting. 

Feet beating the earth haphazardly, the squad Guy Spy lead stumbled 
through the base's front gate. Some time earlier the squad had left with 
full equipment packs for a short, 30 mile, quick stepping march. Most of 
these soldiers were good men, Guy thought, but in need of substantial 
endurance training. After only a few hours of marching the squad had 
started huffing and puffing as if the trotting pace was difficult. Guy 
lead the squad into the main compound and motioned them to halt. 

"Well, men, it's almost time for mess call, so you'd better get to your 
barracks and clean up. Dismissed!" At the sound of the order half the 
squad collapsed, falling hard to the ground, and the other half fell on 
top of them. Guy shrugged his shoulders, "If that's where you want to 
rest?" Guy Spy turned and walked in the direction of his quarters. 

Various personnel saluted as Guy made his way through the base towards 
the barracks he called home. Several weeks ago he'd returned from a field 
assignment and would remain stationed at Fort George until receiving new 
orders. The area Guy lived in was quite sparse, he spent so little time 
there it might never get that 'lived in' look. Regardless, Guy kept his 
bunk immaculately clean and it remained that way because of his absence. 

Having reached his quarters, Guy strode up the stairs, opened the door 
and walked in. The first thing he noticed was the lack of light. Someone 
must have pulled the main switch and the interior of the building was 
almost pitch black; probably some practical joker. Guy stepped into the 
darkness, slowly moving towards where he knew the fuse box was 
located. So intent on restoring the overhead lighting, Guy failed to 
detect the motion ahead of him until the attacker struck. 

The two bodies tumbled to the floor and Guy struggled under the weight 
of whomever he was grappling. A dim light filtered through the window set 
in the door and Guy could make out the outline of the man. The broad 
shouldered intruder tried to keep Guy pinned as he raised something into 
the air. A glint of light shone off a knife blade as the arm descended in 
an arc aimed at Guy's head. Guy twisted his shoulders and neck, and 
the blade struck the wooden floor where his head had just been. The 
attacker fought to pull the knife free from where it had become 
imbedded. 

Reaching his arms around the other man Guy rolled both bodies towards 
the barracks' door. Pulled by the American soldier's considerable strength, 
the attacker lost his grip on the knife and flipped over. The two men 
bashed into the door and rolled out of the building into the growing 
twilight. Guy squeezed with all his might, tightening his grip each time 
the intruder exhaled. Unable to free himself the other man collapsed 
under the constant pressure. Once he was certain of his attacker's 
unconsciousness Guy pushed the man aside, got up off the ground, and 
began to brush himself off as several soldiers came running up. 

"Are you all right, sir?~ One of them asked. 

Guy bent to examine the strange man, "I'll be fine. But who the heck is 
this fellow and what does he want with me?" Stark white hair protruded 
from under a dark green cap and the man's eyebrows were so blanched that 
Guy could hardly make them out. The man's uniform was also green, but 
of varying shades. Guy looked up at the soldiers gathered around him, 
"When he wakes up make sure he doesn't leave. And one of you go get 
the MP's." The soldier who had spoken ran off and the others stared down 
at the unconscious man. 

Remembering the discarded knife, Guy went back into the barracks, 
switched on the main light panel, and plucked the weapon out of the 
wooden floor. Turning the knife over in his hands Guy noticed the 
intricate design of a large tower, with what appeared to be rays of 
light streaming from its top,worked into the blade. Below the tower 
were the two words 'Von Max'. Pondering the inscription's significance 
Guy's attention was suddenly drawn to the sounds of a commotion coming 
from outside. Peering out the door Guy saw the green uniformed 
stranger dodging the attempts of three soldiers trying to tackle him. 

~Hey! Don't let him get away!" Guy sprang from the doorway and leaped 
towards the melee. Seeing the American spy's approach the intruder 
bolted, breaking through the circling soldiers, and ran towards several 
tanks returning from patrol. Ignoring the shouts of the men he dove 
beneath the tracks of the nearest tank. Guy Spy and the pursuing 
soldiers turned away at the sight and grimaced as a loud, squishing 
sound filled the air. 

The tank came to a halt, the intruder's lifeless form spreading into 
a puddle under the wide tracks. A hatch opened and the operator's head 
popped out, "Man, what were guys gonna do to him that he wanted to 
jump under my tank?" Guy and the rest of the soldiers shook their heads, 
astonished by the intruder's suicide. 

"Hey, Guy Spy," someone called from behind the group, UMajor MacLeod 
wants to see you." 

"I'll be right there." As Guy turned and waved, two MP's arrived. Guy 
pointed over at the now reversing tank, "You're too late for the chase, 
boys, but you're just in time to clean up the mess."  Chuckling at the 
soldiers' disgusted expressions Guy strode off towards the Major's 
office. He walked through the outer doors and was ushered in by the 
attractive stenographer. She watched him walk by, learing as Guy 
closed the door behind him. 

Guy stepped up to the desk and saluted, "You wanted to see me, sir?"

Major MacLeod look up from the playing cards spread across his desk, 
"Yes, Guy, your orders just arrived," Solitaire was one of his favourite 
past times. The Major paused long enough to reach into his desk drawer, 
take out a sealed envelope, and pass it to Guy. He immediately continued 
flipping cards. 

~Thank you, sir." Guy took the proffered envelope, saluted and left the 
room. Once outside the office he examined the envelope; imprinted across 
the glued flap was the Presidential Seal. Guy saluted the empty air 
and ripped the envelope open. The orders it contained were short and 
simple, 'Find Baron Von Max and stop him. Signed, President Truman.' 
Baron Von Max? Where had he seen that name before? A bulb lit up above 
Guy's head and he took out the dead intruder's dagger. Inscribed on 
the blade, below the image of the tower, were the words 'Von Max'. Whoever 
this man was he had already tried to have Guy killed and that made 
the American spy very angry. If there was one thing Guy hated more 
than sleep, it was people he didn't know sending assassins to kill 
him. Storming out of the building Guy ran towards his barracks; there 
would be no sleeping for some time.

              PLAYING GUY SPY AND THE CRYSTALS OF ARMAGEDDON

                           Berlin Train Station
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Arriving in Berlin, an Intelligence Report tells Guy Spy that Von Max 
is travelling to Switzerland by train. Guy goes to the train station, 
purchases a ticket, and walks out onto the platform. Waiting for the 
spy, several Goons stand on the opposite side of the train tracks, 
aiming their machine guns across at Guy. 

Guy Spy's Movement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Moving the joystick to the down left position causes Guy to take a step to 
the left, while moving the joystick to the down right position causes Guy 
to step to the right. When the button is not pressed, moving the joystick 
moves the crosshair quickly. If the crosshair reaches the left edge and 
you move the joystick left, Guy will step to the left, and when Guy 
reaches the left edge of the screen he will roll all the way to the 
right side. If the crosshair is at the right edge of the screen and 
the joystick is moved to the right, Guy will step right, and when he 
reaches the right edge of the screen he will roll to the left side. 

Weapon Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pressing the button fires Guy's machine gun, and as long as the button 
is down the gun continues to shoot. While shooting, the machine gun 
jerks around in Guy's hands and when the joystick is moved the crosshair 
will go in that direction, but it will still jerk around making it 
difficult to get an exact aim. 

Health and Bullets Left Indication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two Health indicators on the screen, one for Guy and one for 
the Goons. As Guy gets hit by bullets his health indicator becomes smaller 
and when the indicator disappears Guy is dead. 
As each Goon is shot, the Goon indicator becomes smaller and the scene 
will be completed when the indicator disappears. The machine gun has 
a limited amount of ammunition which is displayed as a Current Clip 
Indicator, showing the number of bullets remaining for that clip, and 
another indicator showing the remaining number of full clips. 

                                   ---===---


		          Gondola Ride To Mountain
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The train pulls into the Switzerland station and Guy jumps out. Checking 
his revolver, Guy pursues Von Max as the evil baron travels up the side 
of a mountain inside a gondola. But Von Max has left a squad of Goons 
to attack Guy, shooting at the spy as the two gondolas move up the 
mountain. 

Guy Spys Movement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To cause Guy to step left or right move the joystick in either direction 
without pressing the fire button. When Guy reaches the centre of the 
screen the next step will cause him to turn and face the other side of 
the Gondola. Each time Guy needs to move from one side of the Gondola to 
the other he will turn at the post between the windows. Pulling the 
joystick back when Guy is in front of a window causes Guy to duck. 

Weapon Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the fire button is held down, Guy aims his gun either to the left, 
center, or right of the other gondola window. The gun fires when the 
button is released. To reload the gun, position Guy at either the far 
left, far right, or centre of the screen and press the fire button. 

Health and Bullet Indicators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At the bottom of the screen is a small figure. Each time Guy is hit, a
