	That install applies to "Gods" © 1990 Bitmap Brothers.


	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the WHDLoad package.

	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").
	
	
    If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
    version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
    some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
    that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
    can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
    at http://mantis.whdload.de
