=============================================================================




                             Greetings Champion !
                             --------------------


   Behold the lands of Rhia! Once a great empire, now dying under the
 stranglehold of corruption and pestilence. The rivers have dried, the harvest
 lies withered on the parched earth and the livestock are diseased and dying.
 The people flock to my tower each day for assuagement, but even I can offer
 no council. Few in out noble kingdom are untouched by the grip of fear. My
 magic has failed me and soon, I will succumb to the foul curse.

   I do not believe this pestilence is the work of nature. Using all my powers
 I am now certain that the forces of darkness are responsible for this
 festering morass you see before you. My spells have revealed magic so great
 and evil that the one responsible for its hegemony is shielded from my
 detection.

   You must rid the land of this malediction, lest all perish and evil will
 reign all powerful.

   Beyond the Shadow Mountains far from here, lies the land of Kolchoth. Once
 a mighty empire of sultans and demi-gods, Kolchoth now lies a decadent ruin
 that remembers little of its former glory. Go to Kolchoth and locate the two
 talismans of lore which will aid us in our hour of need. Thence, look to the
 East, where the rising sun illuminates the lands of Garathor wherein lies the
 lost healing Amulet of Tambor-Rin. Turn Southwards across the plains and
 beyond to where the moon casts its shadow, to the begotten land of the Elves,
 The Iron-Wood forest for there, legend proclaims, lies the Oracle Stone.

   With these artifacts I shall heal the land before evil overruns us and
 darkness reigns all powerful.

   Beyond that I cannot say, but steel yourself for a task greater than any
 that you have faced before.

   I have given you what help I can in the form of the ancient runes of the
 guild of magic. I do not know if they will be of
 use, but guard them safely, for they are sacred. You will find them on the
 previous scroll of this tome (elsewhere on this disk). Go now and may you be
 revered in the sagas for eternity. You are our only hope.

                                                  Alamon the Mystic  23.13.24




                            The Legacy of Sorasil
                            =====================


   The Legacy of Sorasil is an epic fantasy adventure with nine fantastic
 scenarios to challenge even the most experienced gamer. The scenarios in
 Sorasil are not seperate adventures, but all part of a single Campaign with
 one overriding objective: to free the lands of Rhia from the grip of evil.

   To do this you will need to assemble a party of four heroes and take them
 through the campaign world braving the challenges that await you. There are
 monsters with special abilities and deadly puzzles and traps that will test
 your parties skills to the full.

   As you progress through the adventures your characters will gain in
 experience and power. Which is important, because each adventure is
 progressively more difficult (as you would expect !).

   The gameplay in Sorasil is not comfined to dismal dungeons. There are a
 multitude of different locations, enchanted forests, mystic temples and
 strange castles. A host of evil creatures and perils must be overcome, along
 with puzzles and traps to test your mental and physical abilities to the
 full. Dont hesitate too long; THEY are waiting for you !


   GETTING STARTED
   ---------------
   1. Insert your Legacy of Sorasil game disk 1 into the default disk drive.
   2. Plug your mouse into port number 1.
   3. Turn on your computer (Duh...). The game will now load automatically.
 Follow any on-screen loading instructions that may appear.

   Installing Legacy of Sorasil onto your Hard Disk Drive
   ------------------------------------------------------
   1. Turn on your computer (Double Duh...).
   2. Insert Disk 2 at the WorkBench screen.
   3. Double click on the install icon and follow the on-screen loading
 instructions.
   4. Please note A1200 owners may have to revert back to original chipset
 before running via the usual method.


   PROTECTION
   ----------
   Always wear a condom, or femidom, depending upon sex and/or inclination.


   LANGUAGE SCREEN
   ---------------
   This is the first screen you will see after the game has loaded and the
 intro sequence has finished. Click on the appropriate flag for the language
 you wish to play the game in. (English, German or French).

   Once a language has been selected, this screen will disappear and you will
 be taken to the Main Option Screen.


   MAIN OPTION SCREEN
   ------------------
   There are four options, represented bu an icon. To select an option, click
 on its icon with the left mouse button. The icon are described as follows:

   1. Map screen/Play game. (Picture of a Map).
   2. Character Selection Screen. (Picture of a Question Mark).
   3. Load/Save game screen. (Picture of a disk).
   4. Character Modification Screen. (The other one, which I cant make out).

    
   CHARACTER SELECTION SCREEN
   --------------------------
   This screen allows you to select up to four characters to undertake your
 quest. You can choose any four characters you wish.

   To select a character click on one of the doors to open. The character
 currently selected will appear in the door space. Use the mouse to click on
 the arrows left and right under the doorway to toggle through the eight
 characters available.

   The order in which the characters appear in the doorways will determine the
 order of movement in the game. For example, if the Barbarian appears in the
 second doorway from the left, he will be the second character to move during
 the game: If the Paladin is in the first doorway he will move first in the
 game.

   Choose your party of heroes wisely. To help you select, a description of
 each character and their traits follows.


   CHARACTERS AND TRAITS
   ---------------------
   The abilities printed below are the defaults and you can alter some of
 these attributes in the character generation section.



   Angor: The Barbarian
   --------------------
   Angor is a fearsome and worthy hero. A brutal upbringing with the nomadic
 tribes in the Northen Wastes have made Angor a Champion swordsman.

   Armed with a mighty broadsword, Angor shuns the armour traditionally worn
 by men of the warrior caste, opting to use speed and aggression as his
 defences.

   Angors attitude towards battle is a simple one: if it moves, hit it. If it
 does not move, shove it over and then hit it; and if neither of these works,
 then it is probably a wall !

         Strength: 8    Body: 8    Attack: 7    Defence: 7    Perception: 4
                              Mind: 2      Move: 10



   Oakheart: The Ranger.
   ---------------------
   The Forests have traditionally provided Rangers with both their homes and
 way of life.
   Experts in woodcraft and forest lore, Rangers live on their wits, aided by
 the eagle-like perception which they have developed through a lifetime in the
 wilds.
   Oakheart is at home in the wilderness; tracking and woodland magic are
 second nature to him. His sword provides another way out of danger if his
 foresting skills fail him.

         Strength: 5    Body: 6    Attack: 5    Defence: 5    Perception: 10
                              Mind: 4      Move: 11



   Haxar: The Paladin
   ------------------
   The Order of the Knights Paladin are brave and noble crusaders: Guardians
 of justice and honour, whose high ideals must be maintained at all times
 through a Spartan existence.

   Haxar is a pious knight, steadfast, loyal and dependable. Pure in mind and
 deed, he is a noble companion to any on the side of goodness and law.

         Strength: 6    Body: 8    Attack: 7    Defence: 6    Perception: 5
                              Mind: 5      Move: 10



   Calorflame: The Cleric
   ----------------------
   Calorflame is a Priestess who can prove both a powerful ally and a
 dangerous enemy.

   The education and training of clerics involves rigorous religious and
 military aspects - after all, spreading the Word of God is never going to be
 easy in such a lawless world.

   Thus Clerics are a combination of both soldier and sorcerer: formidable
 combatants with life-saving spells.

   Because of her religious convictions, Calorflame is forbidden to shed blood
 and, as a consequence, unable to use edged weapons.

         Strength: 5    Body: 6    Attack: 5    Defence: 5    Perception: 4
                              Mind: 10      Move: 10



   Grimbeard: The Fighter
   ----------------------
   Hailing from the Blue Mountains, Grimbeard is an elite Dwarven warrior
 adept in the ways of war.

   An expert in weapons, strategy and battle tactics, this master axeman is
 also proficient at uncovering and removing traps.

   Grimbeard is the most formidable warrior in the heros complement. His
 combative skills are beyond compare but, like the Barbarian, just dont expect
 much in the way of conversation.

         Strength: 9    Body: 9    Attack: 7    Defence: 8    Perception: 7
                              Mind: 2      Move: 6



   Ravenslock: The Wizard
   ----------------------
   Ravenslock is a supreme sorcerer and learned magic-user. A genius who calls
 upon his awesome mind power in order to crush his foes. Although physically
 weak, Ravenslock magical powers make him an awesome opponent.

   His magic can weaken or defeat opponents where brute strength would fail
 and although weak in combat, the Wizards powers cannot be overstated.

         Strength: 4    Body: 4    Attack: 4    Defence: 2    Perception: 6
                              Mind: 14      Move: 10



   Stormbow: The Adventurer
   ------------------------
   The Elven Adventurer Stormbow is a wanderer who has become a jack of all
 trades.

   A competent swordsman, and spell caster with curative powers, Stormbow is a
 solid and versatile all-rounder.

   His vast experience makes him superbly adaptable with no task or challenge
 proving to be beyond the range of his experience. A worth member of any
 company.

         Strength: 4    Body: 4    Attack: 5    Defence: 5    Perception: 9
                              Mind: 6      Move: 12



   Celeste: The Mystic
   -------------------
   Celeste is a captivating beauty, Mistress of the Elements and an
 accomplished enchantress. Little is known about this mysterious elementalist,
 but she can prove a match for even the most formidable opponents using her
 phenomenal powers.

   Despite her magical prowess, she is prone to physical attacks, having
 limited combat skills.

         Strength: 3    Body: 4    Attack: 4    Defence: 2    Perception: 7
                              Mind: 14      Move: 10



   Once you are happy with your party return to the main menu and enter the
 character modification screen.


   CHARACTER MODIFICATION SCREEN
   -----------------------------
   Each character receives 5 extra points that can be allocated in which ever
 way you wish to the following attributes.

   Body , Combat , Perception , Strength  or  Mind.

   The five points are represented by the Candle of Life Force at the left of
 the screen.

   You cannot decrease any of the character attributes below the default
 minimum.

   To alter an attribute, move on to the appropriate icon. An up or down
 cursor will automatically appear and each time you click on this, the level
 will move up or down by one.

   You can still rearrange the levels after the candle has extinguished by
 taking away points and reallocating them in the same way until you are happy
 with the configuration.

   Click on the cursors underneath the character icon to take you to the next
 party member.

   When you are happy with your modifications, click on the arrow at the foot
 of the page to return to the main menu.


   MAP SCREEN/PLAY GAME
   --------------------
   The map screen looks something like this:

   Your current location will be shown by a flag. The possible destinations
 are shown by flashing icons and you may have a number of destinations to
 choose from, at any one time.

   To choose a destination, click onto one of the icons with the mouse and
 your flag icon will move there. You will now begin your next adventure or
 enter a trading post.

   As well as the scenarios that make up The Legacy of Sorasil, there are
 three trading posts where you will be able to buy and sell equipment and hear
 rumours that may help you on your quest.

   At the end of a scenario you will be returned to the main menu.

   Trading Posts
   -------------
   There are three Trading Posts in Legacy of Sorasil, Where you can buy
 weapons and equipment or hear rumours that may aid you in your quest. To sell
 an object click on the S and you will be presented with a price list giving
 the amount the trader is willing to pay you for a particular object. To
 select an item for sale, move the scroll bar using the cursors until the
 object is highlighted. The item will now appear next to your character icon.
 Click on the item with the left mouse button, drag it onto the shop counter
 and click again to release it. The item will now disappear from your
 inventory, and your gold total will be credited with the appropriate amount.
 Its worth bearing in mind that these traders buy low and sell high; this
 means you will always pay more to buy an item off a trader than he will to
 buy the same item off you.

   To buy an item click on the B and a list of all the traders current stock
 will appear. If you see an item you wish to purchase, move the scroll bar
 until the item is highlighted. The item will appear on the desk in front of
 the trader. Click on the item and move it to your character icon. Click a
 second time to deposit it in your backpack. The appropriate amount of gold
 coins will be deducted from your purse.

   Several items are subject to availability and a trader may not have the
 more exotic items in stock for long. You should also note the prices of each
 item. Generally speaking, the more expensive the merchandice, the more
 effective it will be.

   Finally, remember that not every charcter can use every weapon. The mage,
 for example, would have trouble lifting a broardsword, yet alone hitting
 anyone with it. Should you be foolish enough to attemp to buy weapons you
 cannot use, dont count on the trader letting you know. He is there to make
 money, after all.


   LOAD/SAVE SCREEN
   ----------------
   At the end of each scenario, you will return to the Main Options screen.

   To save a game, click on the save button and follow the on-screen
 instructions. To save a game you will need a blank disk. Do not use your game
 disks. Note that you can only save after a quest.

   To load a saved game, click on the load button and follow the on-screen
 instructions.

   If you wish you can generate a set of characters and save them immediately
 in this section. This will allow you to return to them straight away should
 anything unfortunate happen to them during an adventure.



                               PLAYING THE GAME
                               ================


   Turn
   ----
   The game is divided up into turns: you move your character first and then
 the Forces of Darkness move theirs. Each of your characters moves in the
 order you selected at the start, and there are a range of options each can
 carry out. These are represented by the icons at the foot of the screen and
 described in detail below.

   Each character has an allocation of 20 action points per turn that can be
 used in which ever way you wish. Complex actions will eat away at the points,
 so spend them carefully. For example: Actions such as moving use less points
 than searching the surrounding area for traps of treasure. As a rule of
 thumb, 1 movement point = 1 action point, whilst a search could cost 10 or
 more. You will of course only be able to carry out actions if you have
 sufficient points left. By using your points wisely you will be able move,
 engage in combat, or cast a spell and search for traps in a single turn.

   The actions a character can carry out are as follows:

   1.Movement  2.Combat  3.Magic  4.Search for Treasure  5.Search for Doors
   6.Look at Map  7.Open Doors  8.Check inventory.

   These are represented by the icons in the book at the fool of the screen.
 When an option is no longer available to you then the icon will dim.

   When you have completed a characters activities for that turn, click on the
 bottom right of the icon book to turn the page and carry out activities for
 the next character.

   When you have finished moving all you characters, the Forces of Darkness
 will move theirs. The map will appear on screen showing the movements of any
 monsters and any combat between them and your party will be resolved. The
 screen will then darken for a few seconds whilst the data is updated and you
 can continue to move your characters again.

   Movement
   --------
   The playing area is divided into squares and movement into each square
 costs 1 action point. Characters can move up to their maximum allocation of
 movement points per turn, but they do not have to use all of them.

   Movement points are displayed in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.
 (Under the footprints).

   There are two ways of moving a character.

   Firstly, using the mouse, click on one of the four directional arrows to
 move your character in the direction you wish. The directions available to
 you are highlighted, obviously you will be unable to walk through a tree, for
 example. You can change direction as many times as you wish by simply
 clicking on a different directional arrow.

   Secondly, if you know how many movement points your character has you can
 use the mouse to click on a square you wish that charcter to move to. The
 character will then move to that square using the minimum number of movement
 points possible.

   You do not have to use your movement points all at once. You can, for
 example, move, engage in combat or search and then move again, but remember
 you will be restricted by the amount of action points you have used during
 your turn.

   A character may not move diagonally nor move onto an occupied square. You
 can move through a square occupied by a fellow party member only if there is
 room for you to exit that square. You may never occupy nor move through a
 square with a monster in it.

   Combat
   ------
   Combat is split into two stages: attack and defence but both are moderated
 by the computer. To engage an enemy in combat you must stand on a square
 adjecent to them and, using the left mouse button, click on the sword icon at
 the foot of the screen. The cursor will now change into a sword. Simply point
 your sword onto the enemy you wish to fight and the computer will resolve
 combat. If your character strikes an opponent three times during an attack
 round, this indicates that combat was successful and that a hit has been made
 against your opponent.

   The time it takes for one round of combat depends on which character is
 fighting. The Barbarian and Fighter will use up less of their action points
 per combat round than the other characters.

   You cannot attack diagonally, but up to four characters can attack the same
 opponent.

   To save time moving between character and icon you can, if you wish, click
 on the combat icon with the right mouse button. From then onwards, every time
 you press the right mouse button the cursor will change into a sword and you
 can proceed to engage combat in the usual manner. The option to take this
 short cut is not restricted to the combat icon, but can be used with any
 other icon ie: Spells, Map, Search etc.

   Magic
   -----
   All characters can use magic potions and certain characters are able to use
 spells. The effectiveness of a spell or a potion is gauged by the mind of the
 caster. A potion of lightning bolt thrown by the Barbarian will prove far
 less effective than one hurled by the Mystic and, of course, dont expect the
 big guy do much else that turn.

   The greater a characters intelligence the more potent the spell or potion
 and the less time it takes to cast.

   To cast a spell or use a potion click on the magic icon. This will take you
 to a screen similar to the inventory, but instead of Equipped and Backpack
 this has two sections headed Potions and Spells. (Spells can be used more
 than once whilst potions have only one charge). Use the mouse to click on the
 spell or potion you wish to use: the cursor will now change to a pentacle.

   Now click on the arrow at the bottom right of the screen, this will take
 you back to the main playing screen.

   If the spell or potion you are casting affects an area or can only be used
 on the caster themselves (eg Potion of Health) the magic will now work
 automatically.

   If the magic is cast over a specific individual, the pentacle will remain
 on the screen. Place the pentacle over the character or monster you wish to
 cast the spell at and click the left mouse button.

   If you decide now not to cast the spell, click the right mouse button.

   If your magic was successful the effects of your magic will appear on the
 screen. Remember the effectiveness of the of all magic is dependant upon the
 mind-points of the caster.

   For a list of Magic Spells and their effects see the Spellbook.

   Searching For Traps/Secret Doors
   --------------------------------
   Click on the door icon with the left mouse button and an on screen message
 will tell you whether your search has been successful and if so how many
 traps/secret doors you have found. Click on the message to remove it.

   If you have been successful the Playing Screen will show the locations of
 the traps/secret doors you have discovered in their appropriate locations.

   Once a trap has been discovered it remains a hazard until it has been
 deactivated. To do this you will need a tool kit. (The Dwarf already has a
 tool kit in his inventory, the other characters must buy one). Once you have
 discovered a trap, move your character with the tool kit to a square adjacent
 to the trap, select the toolkit icon from your inventory and exit the
 inventory. Click on the trap you wish to deactivate with the cursor. The
 square is now safe to walk upon.

   Monsters do not set off traps, its unfair but true: they set them. A few
 words of advice; dont be foolhardy as traps are just as dangerous to the
 second person who activates them as the first.

   Searching For Treasure
   ----------------------
   This is done in the same way as searching for traps. Click on the treasure
 icon and an on screen message will tell you whether your search has been
 successful. If you have found treasure the screen will tell you what you have
 found, where it was hidden and show an icon representing the item you have
 found.

   If you have found treasure, click on the left mouse button to delete the on
 screen message and you will find that the trasure has been added to your gold
 total/equipment list in your inventory.

   If you have found a magic item, follow the same procedure to delete the
 message then click on your inventory icon. Your inventory will appear with
 the icon representing the newly found magic item in your backpack. If you
 click on the item with the left mouse button, the name of the item will
 appear in your inventory.

   You can choose to keep it there or equip yourself with it. Only by
 equipping yourself with the item can you make use of its powers. Potions are
 best left in your backpack until needed.

   Map
   ---
   Clicking on this icon will show you a map of the area you have explored so
 far. It will show the locations of monsters and members of your party (useful
 for when they are all seperated by miles of underground tunnels).

   At the end of each turn the Map Screen will appear showing the movements of
 the Forces of Darkness for their corresponding turn.

   Looking at the Map costs you no action points.

   You can scroll around the map by using the four arrows in the bottom right
 hand corner of the screen. This will take you through the known areas of the
 map. Also by clicking the circle in the middle of the arrows, you can centre
 the map on the character currently looking at it. To leave the map, click on
 the arrow in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.

   Opening Doors
   -------------
   To enter or leave a room characters must use the door (unless they have
 some magical means available). To open a door stand on the square in front of
 it and click on the key icon using the left mouse button. The same procedure
 can be used to close an open door. Opening a door does not use up any
 movement points and a character can still move if they have any movement
 points left for that turn. Once opened a door remains open for the entire
 game until a character shuts it. The cost is 1 action point. Note that should
 the character be adjacent to more than one door, then they will open the one
 directly in front of them.

   Inventory
   ---------
   Clicking on this will take you to the following screen.
   This is the inventory screen and it lists the equipment your character
 possesses and where they are carrying that equipment.

   The top and middle boxes on the left are where weapons are placed when not
 in use, the box below tells you how much gold a character has.

   Next to these are two large boxes called Equipped and Backpack. Items not
 currently in use by the character, can be stored until needed in the
 backpack.

   In order to use equipment such as a weapon or magical item, characters must
 equip themselves. To do this, press the left mouse button to click on the
 item you want to equip the character with, drag the icon into the Equipped
 section of the screen and press the left mouse button again to release the
 item.

   At the foot of the screen is a panel. It is usually blank but if you click
 on an item with the mouse, its name will appear in this panel and remain
 until the left mouse button is clicked again.

   To return to the main playing screen, use the mouse to click once on the
 arrow in the bottom right corner of the screen.

   Checking your inventory costs no action points.
