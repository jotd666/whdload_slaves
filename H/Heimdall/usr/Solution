Heimdall 1

Submitted by: Dj Simo

First some tips that will prove invaluable in your forthcoming
quest:

1. Choose only three people to travel to the islands as this will
allow them to advance a lot quicker. Take Heimdall, the best
fighter and the best wizard as this gives you a good, overall
party for any situation that may arise.

2. You will find yourself drastically running short of room to
carry your  equipment so be prepared to discard some of your
items. You only need two weapons: a dagger (preferable silver) and
an axe or sword (a Storm Blade would be nice). Give these weapons
to Heimdall as he will do most of your fighting. Some of the
spells are not really worth the space. For example, spells like
Aesir's Dexterity and Vanir's Strength should be discarded as they
only slightly improve your performance. Plain rings, charms, gold
rings, amethyst, ruby keys and circlets are only to be used for
selling material in shops so they should be thrown away if you
have enough money.

3. The only types of key used are plain, gold, silver, iron,
diamond, jade and stone. Discard all others as they are useless
and give all keys and gold to one person. Also, make sure you get
rid of any powers runes you collect on the first level as they
only serve to weight you down on the later stages.

4. Battles are inevitable but easy to deal with if you follow one
simple rule. The easiest way to kill them is to continually throw
daggers at them as this reduces their energy but gives them no
time to retaliate.

5. Last but not least is experience. To gain experience you must
kill every monster you come across and open all the chests you can
find. Don't bother with the disarm traps spell, it's pretty easy
to dodge the arrows. Just go to the point where they come out of
the wall and walk along. You'll suffer no damage as the collision
detection is only in the tip of the arrow.

6. Weapons are pretty hard to come across but here they are in
order of power and ability should you find them.:

axe            sword               dagger
runic axe      runesword           silver dagger
adamant axe    crystal sword
stone axe      thunderblade
storm blade

To get rid of pesky dwarves, sorcerers, trolls and giant rats use
a combination of daggers, swords and axes. Daggers and ice spells
are best for beating spiders, swords and axes to kill the manic
monkey men.

7. There's a sneaky way to get a great runelore rating while
travelling around Midgard. Go to the island  kill the sorcerer you
find there and then nab the nearby potion and drink it (or take it
back to your ship and give it to somebody else). When you come
back to the island the potion will have magically reappeared. You
can keep returning and leaving as many times as you want.

8. There's a great way to get money by the sackful. Go to the
island where you have  to pay a silver coin to enter and find the
shop. Give heimdall all the gold and the adamantite axe. Sell the
axe and confirm the sale. Then click on the sell icon again. The
shop owner will happily buy the axe again! Keep doing this until
the shop is full then buy back the axe. You should be very
rich....

The levels are all numbered in reference to the maps along with
any items you need to successfully complete them.

QUEST  ONE - THE SEARCH FOR THOR'S HAMMER
**********************************************

ISLAND ONE - Requires nothing
Make your way around the island picking up everything and killing
the orc. When you get the chasm, cast the revelation spell to make
a bridge appear.

ISLAND TWO - Requires nothing
First go through the door on the right wall nearest the chest.
Explore these two rooms and then return to the first room. You
should be in possession of a disarm traps spell. Cast it and then
open the chest. Now enter the other door on the right hand wall.
Make your way around the walls of the second room to avoid the
traps in the middle. A normal key opens the door in the next
corridor. Now go through the door at the bottom of the screen. In
the room with the orc in, cast remove walls at the far right of
the room. Now return to the first room and exit through the final
door. In the room with mantraps, cast disarm traps and then tread
on the switch. The exit is the central door of the next room.

ISLAND THREE - Requires 1 normal key, hemlock and descension spell
Number the switches 1 to 6 from left to right and step on them in
this order: 2 - 6 - 1. If you make a mistake, number 5 is a reset
button. The locked door in the next room is unlocked with a normal
key. Use the descension spell to lower the block in the next room.
Take the sapphire and discard it or sell it to the shopkeeper. In
the next room you will find a man. Give him the hemlock.

ISLAND FOUR - Requires disarm traps spell
Use disarm traps spell in the first room and go through the door
on the right hand wall. Explore the corridors, gathering as much
as possible before returning to the first room and going through
the other door. Collect the contents of the chest before leaving
the island.

ISLAND FIVE - Requires nothing
Cast a disarm traps spell in the first room and then open the
chests. Make your way around the island until you reach the last
room with the man suspended in mid-air. Walk to the altar and
drink from the chalice. The man will now give you a market pass.

ISLAND SIX - Requires market pass
Travel around the island until you find the two magic portals.
Change your character to either a wizard or a fighter and go
through the corresponding portals. Give the pass to the man at the
end if you need to go into the shop.

ISLAND SEVEN - Requires a normal key and a loverly silver key
Walk around the island collecting everything you can. The first
locked door is opened with a normal key and the second requires
the silver key. Make sure you have the diamond  before you leave
the island.

ISLAND EIGHT - Requires a normal key and a quite delicious silver
key
Explore the island before attempting anything. The first door is
opened with the silver key and the second requires the normal key.
In the room after the second door, take the first path to get lots
of useful items. Fight the two men with clubs and explore their
paths before leaving the island.

ISLAND NINE - Requires a silver coin and a diamond.
Find the two chests with the runestone and then locate the tree
with three branches. Place the diamond on the nearest, the silver
coin in the centre and the runestone on the other branch. This
will give you the serpent killer spell.

ISLAND TEN -  Requires a gold key, two normal keys and a silver
key
Use the silver key to unlock the left hand door in the first room.
The other two doors need normal keys to open them. The bulky door
is unlocked with the gold key. Take the runestone and go through
each corridor pushing all five switches. Now go through the door
and tread on the magic symbol. Now exit the island.

ISLAND ELEVEN - Requires nothing.
Go around collecting everything as before. Make sure you have the
shrinking spell before you leave by killing the grey monkey.

ISLAND TWELVE - Requires a jade key and the shrinking spell
Kill the serpent with the serpent killer. Now go through the
doorway at the top of the first room and give the six power rune
scrolls to the hooded figure. Collect the stone key across the
bridge. Use a jade key to open the gate in the centre of the first
room (if you don't have one, go through the bottom doorway in the
first room). Use the stone key to open the next gate. The scroll
in the chest is useless. Use the shrinking spell to reduce thor's
hammer to a more manageable size.


QUEST  TWO - THE SEARCH FOR FREY'S SPEAR

through the unlocked door in this room and killed the two wizards.

ISLAND FIVE - Requires revelation spell
Use the giant killer spell if you have one. Some of the holes in
the wall contain giant rats or spiders and others are doors that
you can use. If you choose the correct ones (start on the far
right of the first room, straight through the second and third
ones), you will eventually end up on a giant's bookshelf. Kill him
with a giant killer spell, go to the end book and cast revelation.
Have a look around and you should find a shrinking spell.
You can also begin this island by walking through the left doorway
and take the gemstones from the right cauldron. You will find a
runelore potion in the next two rooms. Leave the island the you
