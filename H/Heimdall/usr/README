   full of bugs, read the end of the readme)

 version 1.x (1999) done by John Sleck
 - disk & password protection removed
 - Games can be saved to HD, use the CUSTOM1 tooltype to choose
   a virtual savedisk.

notes on spanish version:

- disk 4 (5th disk) seems to have a corrupt sector. Since it's only 512
  bytes long, I included the correct data in the slave and fix the data
  when loading.
- load & save are swapped. Be careful! Since those are images and not text
  it's rather time-consuming to fix that, only for spanish version.
