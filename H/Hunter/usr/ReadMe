Notes by Harry:
---------------
Fixed:  Game encryption used many kind of 68000-only programming. Rewritten
        for 680x0.
        Some dbf-delays replaced.

Default quitkey is numerical *. Change it with the QUITKEY-tooltype.

Known bug: Demo doesnt work correctly. I tried already 6 h to fix it,
          but couldnt manage it. Its simply that all events are
          recorded timedependend, and on faster cpus the playing speed
          is different.

Note:   Dont forget to 'format' your game position file on hd before the first 
          save of a position.


Notes by StingRay for V1.30:
----------------------------
Here is the updated patch for this great game. I have coded a RawDIC imager
(which was fun to do) and also made an imager for the save disk so you can
now install your save disk too if you wish. If no save disk exists it will
now be created by the patch.

If you have already installed the old patch by Harry you only need to replace
the slave file, I have kept the disk format compatible with Harry's
old "The Patcher" imager!

The game had graphics problems on fast machines, this was caused by
self-modifying code in the drawing routine which I have fixed. The game now
runs with enabled caches. Additionally I have also replaced the movep
instruction used in the decrypter with 68060 compatible instructions.
I didn't fix the demo mode but may do so in a later update as I have a few
ideas how to make it run properly on all machines.

The demo also has poor framerate. Actual game has a good framerate, so it's cool.
