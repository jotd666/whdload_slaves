 This install applies to "Zool 2" (c) 1993 Gremlin - 2 disks. Thanks to
 Mad-Matt and Chris Vella for sending the originals! This install supports:

- Original ECS version (Mad-Matt)
- Original AGA version (Chris Vella)
- Mok/Classic cracked ECS version (download from http://www.back2roots.org)
- Original CD32 version

REQUIREMENTS:
- Slave requires WHDLoad V17+ (and RawDIC for ECS version)
- ECS game requires 1.0Mb chip mem (+1.9Mb other memory for preload option)
- AGA/CD32 game requires 1.6Mb chip mem and 0.5Mb other mem (+1.9Mb other memory for preload option)

 The AGA and CD32 versions of the game requires an installed A1200/A4000
 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp "kick40068.A4000").
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp. "kick40068.A4000.RTB") 
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

  this thanks to the CD32 version that include code symbols!!) on CUSTOM2=1

            "VISION"__________________________________20 lives

            "KICKASS"____________________Unlimited smart bombs

            "PLUNGER"_________________________Start on level 6
            "WARPMODE"_________________________________Unknown

  The screen will flash red if you typed the code properly. These
  codes assume a USA/UK keymap.

I have allowed the high scores to be saved if you use one of the above
level codes, but if you use any of the other cheats, high scores will not
be saved.

Ronny Illgen kindly supplied his Amiga Fun coverdisk version but either the
disk images have been damaged or whoever compiled it has butchered the
game.  I suspect the later as there are a lot of corrupted files and levels
2, 3 and 4 will not decompress correctly.  It is also unusual that one of
the best crackers Mok could not compress the game down to 2 disks yet it
was done for the Amiga Fun release - another sure sign that it was never
completely working.  It looks to me like somebody has taken the Mok/Classic
crack as a base, repacked all files with the MASM cruncher and rejigged the
contents of the disks.  Needless to say, the coverdisk doesn't work on my
A1200 or A500 when booted from floppy and therefore I will not waste time
trying to fix the game when the coverdisk itself appears to have been
broken.  If you have the Amiga Fun version, use the cheat listed above to
start on level 2, 3 or 4 and if it works, please contact me and I will
re-enable support for that version.

This install was quite hard work as the game has some really stupid access
faults!

You can download the full game from the great site Back to the Roots at
http://www.back2roots.org

A big thank you to Frank for the superb icons!  If you have a close look
you will see that each of them has a different image!  I have also included
the original 4 colour icon which is installed by the script on disk 2 of
the AGA version.  Frank would not make icons this bad so that one is not
his, OK! :)

Greetings to Mad-Matt, Chris, Ronny, Carlo, Frank, Wepl, Jean-François Fabre, all
Action members, my testing crew and the entire WHDLoad team!
