                     FOXY PRESENTS YA THE DOC FOR Z-OUT!!


        Victory celebrations for the success of the mission X-OUT which
 anhiilated the satellite of the planet Alpha Centauri ended abruptly as the long
 range scanners showed intense activity on the planet itself -an ATTACK from
 the planet is IMMINENT.
        Z-OUT: the mission to destroy the planet Alpha Centauri. The H.Q of the
 federation now seeks a brave man to pilot the space craft. What lies ahead is
 unknown except that the defences of Alpha Centauri are strong and multi-level.
        The game consists of huge worlds, each with totally new opponents and
 defence systems. 12 giants aliens and dozens of different smaller opponents
 are standing by to defend Alpha Centauri. 



                                  START GAME

 the beam.

		  	WEAPONS IN THE 1-PLAYER MODE.
			-----------------------------

	There are 7 different weapons systems divided into three levels. Des-
 troyed aliens leave symbols and collecting them provides you with new additi-
 nal weapons. The different weapons are described below:

	Level 1:	A drone. It supplies the energy  for the weapons.
	Level 2:	A weapon module.
	Level 3:	An additional weapon module. Plus the drone can fol-
			low opponents and absorb their energy.



				  THE BEAM.
				  ---------

	Keeping the fire button pressed enable the ship to collect energy for
 a beam shot. An acoustic signal indicates the beam is ready to be fired.
 Release the fire button to energise the beam.



				  THE DRONE.
				  ----------

	The drone is very important, as a protector from most of the shots and
 aliens. It can dock and separate from the ship. It supplies energy while doc-
 ked. To separate the drone, press the space bar. You can position the drone 
 on the screen by manoeuvring the ship cleverly. To dock again, touch it with
 the front or back of the craft or just press Space again. At the highest 
 weapons collected (at least three symbols collected), the drone can attach to
 their opponent to absorb their energy. Experiment to find the many ways the 
 drone can be used.



				THE SATELLITES.
				---------------

	You can also get satellites, placed around the ship, by collecting 
 the appropriate satellite symbols. Use the cursor keys to position them.
 Like the Drone, the satellites protect you from the shots and most of the
 aliens.

 BOUNCING FLAMES:
		 Flames shot diagonally from the ship and bounce back from the
		 walls. This weapon is very useful in  narrow passages, boun-
		 cing from wall to wall until they reach an alien.

 DOUBLE/TRIPLE SHOT:
		 Supplies you with a double or triple shot (depends on the 
		 weapon level).

FUSION BOMB/CENTRIFUGAL SUPER CHARGER:
		 Weapon level one supplies with a green color shot, which into 5
		 different shots after a short while.
		 The second level changes the direction of the shots - the
		 drone fires centrifugal shot over the whole screen, very useful
		 in wide passages without obstacle while your ship is un
		 der attack by lots of little opponents.

FLANE THROWER:
		 Strengthens standard shots with flames which follow the verti-
		 cal movement of the ship.

STREAKER:
		 The drone fires flashes which change their height during fight
		 in the first weapon level. In the second the satellites can 
		 also fire these flashes, which follow the vertical movements of
	  	 the ship.

SATELLITE ROTATION:
                 Three satellites rotating around your ship shooting blue 
                 scythes. Once this system is activated, all other systems are
		 deactivated unless you collect another weapon provides you
                 with the normal weapons again.(drone and satellites)

CREEP BOMB:      
                 Shots very similar to flames, rotating around each obstacle.
                 Used to strike the guns emplacement behind obstacles impossi-
	         ble to reach with normal weapons.


			      WEAPONS IN TEAM MODE.
			      ---------------------

	Each player flies his own space craft and helps the other in battle.
 To keep the game balanced, there are only two weapons systems in the team mode
 divided to three levels:

	Level 1:	Activate the first satellite.
	Level 2: 	Activates the second satellite.
	Level 3: 	You get the weapons displayed on the symbol you collect


SCORE:	The score and the remaining lives of player one are displayed in the 
	right of screen and on left for player two.

SECRETS:  I each world the secret is revealed by flying over it. You will see
	  the word secret flashing. Remember the emplacement when playing 
	  again.

ADDITIONAL SHIPS:  Obtained by collecting the appropriate symbol or by clearing
		   a difficult section or by activating a 'Secret'.

ADDITIONAL SPEED:  Collect the speed symbol.

GAME OVER:  To save your high scores, remove the write protection on the disk.
	    Please don't remove or reset computer when the highscores is written
	    on the disk. If you do, the disk might be damaged.
