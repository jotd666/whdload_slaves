Notes:

- Ignore the system requester telling there's a checksum error during the installation.
- The J+K invincibility cheatmode has been replaced by J+I because the J+K key combination
  is not possible on the A1200 keyboard (cheap hardware, 2 keys on the same line
  cannot be pressed at the same time...)
- On WinUAE there are several issues: intro stars all aligned (first time), and hiscore position shifted. Also
  disk appears as write protected.

Cheats (thanks LemonAmiga):

Level select	Hold J and press 1 to 8
Stage select	[Keypad 1] to [Keypad 3], well too bad for A600s :)
Unlimited lives	J + I  (as J + K doesn't work on A1200)
