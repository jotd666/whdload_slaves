 This install applies to "Zak Mc Kracken" Â© 1989 Lucasfilm.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

History:

 version 1.4 (09.03.2020) still done by JOTD:
 - reduced chipmem size back to 512k (was 1MB in 1.3 due to debug code left in old slave)

 version 1.3 (01.03.2020)
 - Adapted to whdload v17
 - added CUSTOM2=1 to skip protection crack (issue #0004026)
   I've added this option, so cracked versions (like the
   italian version provided here) works. Else both cracks
   conflict and it locks up after entering any visa code.
 
 version 1.2 (01.06.03)
 - protection caused strange behaviour on drawing sections: all drawing
   passed, which is not very good. Changed, now CUSTOM1=1 allows to cheat,
   else, the correct drawing will be checked.
 - CTRL-C quit key caused access faults: fixed, now just quits.
 - rewritten install package from scratch (but there's no need to reinstall
   in order to upgrade)
 - rewritten slave from newest kick13.s sources, using real dos.library

 version 1.1 (2002)
 - protection REALLY removed, for all versions (tested with
  UK and german version).
 - Mouse move speedup.

 version 1.0 (2001) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - Runs now properly from HD using WHDLoad/KickEmu/KickDOS
 - Access fault removed
 - Manual protection removed
 - Full use of fast memory
 - Gamesaves without OS swaps
 - Quit key (F10, or configurable with QUITKEY) anytime
 - Convenient install script
 - Normal/NewIcon/GlowIcon/Exoticon icons provided
 - Docfile and walkthrough included


Notes:

- Game worked almost OK in DOS mode but some gfx may be corrupt depending on your system
  and there were no quit key
- Game worked almost OK using OSEmu but a bug in some gfx lib emulation routine screwed up
  the scrolling to the left (!). Using original graphics library through KickEmu works.

Thanks to Bert Jahn for writing kickemu.s kickstart interface system.
