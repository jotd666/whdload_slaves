SCENARIO

Zynaps is a shoot-em-up set in an alien infested planetary system.

The game begins with our hero escaping in a Scorpion fighter from an alien
space station out into deep space. Battle continues through asteroid storms
to a nearby planet from where, equipped with weaponry and hyperspace units
taken from destroyed alien craft, he sets out in search of the secret alien
stronghold.

After many terrifying battles fought throughout the solar system our hero
discovers the location of the alien base and the final conflict can begin...

CONTROLS

Use a joystick to simulate up, down, left, right and fire. During the titles
sequence:

F1 selects one or two player games
F2 selects one or two joysticks

During play the fire button fires weapons or when held down activates the
fuel scoop. Some weapons require the fire button to be held down before they
will fire. To pause the game during play press ESC. Press fire to restart or
Q to quit game.

THE SCORPION ATTACK FIGHTER:

The MK1 Scorpion is supplied with a wider range of sophisticated equipment
and weaponry powered by an internally mounted fuel scoop.

Propulsion:        The main drive units can be operated at four power levels
                   ranging from low power for delicate control in tight
                   spaces, to a maximum setting for high speed combat in
                   deep space.

WEAPON SYSTEMS

Pulse Lasers:      Ideal for heavy duty alien blasting. These wing mounted
                   lasers also have four power settings.

Plasma Bombs:      Two independent bomb throwers provide awesome destructive
                   power against groundbased targets.

Homing Missiles:   These self propelled missiles carry scaled down planet
                   bursting warheads and, once locked onto target, will
                   destroy almost any large alien craft.

Seeker Missiles:   The ultimate in intelligent weaponry. Seeker missiles
                   carry automatic target acquisition circuitry designed to
                   lock onto any target they are able to destroy.

THE FUEL SCOOP

This provides the power to activate the Scorpion's main systems. To activate
a piece of equipment (weapons, propulsion, etc) collect sufficient fuel to
highlight the desired equipment in the WEAPONRY ACTIVATION INDICATOR, then
collect one more piece of fuel with the scoop in ACTIVATION mode.

To go into activation mode hold down the fire button until the ship changes
from yellow to blue and keep it depressed while picking up the fuel. The new
equipment will be activated, or it's power setting increased and the
indicator reset to position one - Speedup.

The WEAPONRY ACTIVATION INDICATOR displays, in order:

SPEEDUP              Increase speed
FIREPOWER            Increase laser power
BOMBS                Activate bomb thrower 
MISSILES             Enable missile targeting

THE OPPOSITION

The opposition in Zynaps comes in five dangerous varieties:

Spacecraft:          Small flying craft can usually be destroyed with one hit                  
                     from a laser, bomb or seeker missile. Homming missiles
                     cannot lock-on.

Ground               Dangerous planet-bound defence installations require
Installations:       multiple laser hits or a single bomb or seeker missile
                     to destroy them.

Alien Command        Large flying craft, heavily armed and well protected.
Ships:               These can be destroyed with multiple laser hits or
                     homming missiles.

Mother Ships:        Giant aliens - like the command ships only more so!

Natural Hazards:     These consist largely of asteroids and other flying
                     debris - keep well clear!

Warning:             Alien craft are known to be well armed with a variety
                     of missiles, homming missiles and mines!

Scoring:             Points are awarded for blasting individual aliens and
                     special bonuses for destroying complete formations of
                     more dangerous aliens.
                     Bonus lives are awarded at 10,000 points and every
                     20,000 thereafter.

Enjoy the game, hope the docs help     MERKWooD/MAAD
