 This install applies to "Zool" © 1991-1993 Gremlin Software

 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 ECS: The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 AGA: The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 CD32: The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The CD32 version of the game requires an installed A1200/A4000
 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp "kick40068.A4000").
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp. "kick40068.A4000.RTB") 
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

This installer requires the Zool ORIGINAL disks (there are 2)
or Zool original CD. It will not work for cracked versions.

History:

version 2.0 (06.01.2019) done by JOTD:

- AGA/CD³²: Fixed self-modifying code so gfx aren't trashed anymore with fast machines or UAE JIT (issue #0004011)
- AGA/CD³²: access fault removed (when returning from secret level)
- AGA: access fault fixed
- CD³²: reworked controls, choice of more "classical" controls and 2-button
- CD³²: trainer: infinite energy/time
- CD³²: original keys re-enabled: 1,2,3,4, see below
- AGA: trainer: infinite lives, original cheat keys activated (1,2,3,4)
- ECS: fully rewritten slave, merged amiga format & MFM track versions
- fixed SNOOP bugs for ECS & AGA versions

versions 1.x (1996-?) done by JOTD:

- ECS/AGA: Codewheel protection is removed.
- ECS: Three versions are now supported: the original release, golden awards release,
  and another release thanks to both users who reported there existed other versions
  and sent me their disk 1.
- Hiscores saved to hard disk
- Music fixed to work with caches
- Convenient installer script letting you choose between the versions
- Nice RawDIC imager by Codetapper (he made a slave for one version of the
  game but I convinced him to let me release my megapack for this game :))
- CD³² version: Buggy country check removed (can be run in PAL or NTSC and on UAE now :))
- CD³² version: Reworked controls so 2 button joysticks can be used
- CD³², 3 ECS, 1 AGA and 1 dostrack Amigafun coverdisk versions supported.
- Less memory demanding. Runs on 512K chipmem amigas (with at least 2MB of fastmem)
- Docfile included

Controls:

- Set CUSTOM1=1 to enable CD³² joypad controls or original 1-button:
  * Play/Pause/P-key: pause/resume/options
  * Blue button acts like green button (so 2 button joysticks can be used too)
  * ESC: game over
  
In the title screen, the program asks for 3¹/² button (green)
Just press fire or blue/2nd button depending on your control settings

Thanks to Psygore for improving OSEmu/kickemu for real joypad support.


CHEAT MODE

The (original) cheat mode can be activated by typing 'GOLDFISH' in the main menu
(only for ECS version, cheat mode enabled by default for AGA & CD32)

During the game, press:

1 for invincibility (temporary, doesn't work in turbo mode)
2 for levelskip
3 for worldskip
4 to lose one life

Notes:

- SPS version 893 does not work with this install
- AGA version contains more images & start animation
  (but lacks the 7th world & loading/level complete music). The character is still trashed
  on fast machines (A1260). Releasing as-is as I already forgot to release it months ago...
- CD32 version lacks this start animation but is the best one
  featuring 2-button controls, easy wall climbing, 4 levels
  per world aaaand ... a 7th world (plus CD music in
  when running on a real CD32, I could not preserve that feature unfortunately)  
  So far this is the best CD32 enhancement ever made
  over an already existing AGA version. Kudos to Gremlin
