            JAMES POND II - ROBOCOD
         HE'S MEAN, HE'S GREEN, HE'S PART MACHINE

			   - Oceanic Times - 
	Maybe takes over toy factory and holds world to ransom.

In a new bid for world domination, the evil Doctor Maybe has taken over 
the main north pole based toy factory and has sabotaged many of the toys
destined for homes throughout the world this Christmas.
As yet, we do not know his demands, but world leaders are meeting as a matter
of urgency to discuss the situation in an affort to avert his treacherous 
threats. 

Government spokesmen have not been available for comment; however, 
we do know that the prime minister has cancelled all meetings and this   
morning left for Washington where it is believed he will be meeting up 
with the president and other world leaders.
Rumours emerged from Whitehall last light that security services have been
put on alert and that the highly secretive successful F.1.5.H underwater 
espionage agency has been contacted. 

Doctor Maybe strikes dread in the hearts of us all, but having been 
thwarted in the past by F.1.5.H, it was believed that he had given up
all hope of future dastardly activities. It seems, how ever, that his earlier
failures have made him more determined than ever to dominate the world stage.

President of North Pole Toys Inc., Mr. S Claus, who narrowly escaped from 
Maybe's able clutches and first brought the news to the oceanic times said
last night... 'This is terrible news, our whole year's supply was ready for
dispatch when we were overwhelmed by Maybe and his gang.' Pressed further 
by our top reporter Lewis Lean, Claus said that he had little faith in world
governments to solve the problem and that the only way to ensure world safety 
this Xmas was to let F.1.5.H deal with the problem. 

Lewis Lean, the only known person outside of world leaders to have made 
contact with F.1.5.H, speculates that they will have to put their top agent
onto the case, James Pond. He has had dealings with Maybe before and knows 
how his eagle and dastardly mind works. However, Pond has been out of 
circulation for a while since last encounter with Maybe and is rumoured to
have been involved in a highly intensive training programme.
 
We will keep you informed on any further developments. In the meantime the
world waites with bated breath for Maybe's next move. It seems that our only 
chance now lies in the capable fins of the aquatic super hero, James Pond.
Wherever you are Pond, our hearts are with you.

  | Doctor Maybe is back!  We have learned from Washington and            |
  | the Kremlin that he has taken over the central toy factory            |
  | on the north pole and has sabotaged an unknown number of              |
  | toys disguised as penguins with tiny but lethal explosive             |
  | charges. If they are not diffused within 48 hours they                |
  | will be distributed throughout the globe and wreak havoc              |
  | throughout Xmas.                                                      |
  |                                                                       |
  | Your mission is tough but straightforward. Infiltrate the             |
  | factory and render the penguins safe.                                 |
  |                                                                       |
  | Here are your mission assignments. They include all the               |
  | information we've been able to get from our spies inside              |
  | the factories. Remember, we don't have the keys to each               |
  | factory, but when you rescue the toys in one, Maybe's                 |
  | short circuited security systems unlocks the next door for            |
  | you!!!                                                                |
  |                                                                       |
  | We have been informed that there is a factory section,                |
  | hidden on the blueprint plans of the castle. We can give              |
  | you no information of its whereabouts, but this section               |
  | must be found to fully complete your task.                            |
  |                                                                       |
  | You will need your new Robocod expandosuit to aid you in              |
  | your mission, so dust it off and grease it up!                        |
  |                                                                       |
  | Good Luck!                                                            |
  |                                                                       |
  |  "F"                                                                  |
  |_______________________________________________________________________|

Rescue Mission One: A sport to catch a mackerel!

Jump over ping-pong bats and volleyballs, then stretch
high above giant boxing gloves and golf clubs to clobber
Dr. Maybe's servants of destruction, if your lucky enough
to find an aeroplane, just jump in the cockpit to fly! Our
spies tell us that this is where Maybe has hidden one of 
the sets of wing attachments for your expandosuit.

Rescue Mission Two: Cuddly, cute and cannontankerous

Rescue sinister stuffed bears and horrified hippos before
Dr. Maybe devours them! Collect points and extra lives on 
this level to stock up for the lean times ahead. Jump in 
the cannons then push joystick up to get a boost to the 
top!

Rescue Mission Three: P, pick up a penguin!

All the world's holiday cakes, sweets and biscuits are
made here in Santa's confectionery factory. Battle half
baked cherry pie soldiers and Maybe's mutant caterpillars
to make the sour sweets edible again. If barber pole exits
aren't getting you anywhere, look for secret pits and 
tunnels!

Rescue Mission Four: Crazy cars and cranking cogs!

Model trains, hungry cars, and crazed wind up dolls chase
you throught the ins- and -outs of the mechanical toy
factory! Remember, Dr. Maybe has a screw loose so stay on
the tips of your fins! Use the dolls and small trains to
bounce up to the goodies out of reach.

Rescue Mission Five: Bubbles and bathtubs!

There's only one way to rescue the toys made especially 
for bathtime - bathtup. Bump the very first mystery
block you see and a tub pops out for you to use. Push
joystick up to jump in, then fly up. Be sure to check near
the bottom for golden ankhs (extra lives) - you're
constantly moving so pay close attention!

Rescue Mission Six: Batty bored games!

Vicious chess pieces and foul dominoes abound in the board
games factory. Defeat legions of snakes and climb high
ladders to rescue hostage toys from the hands of Dr.
Maybe. Use your super stretchability to reach secret rooms
and rescue unhappy toys hidden among the cards and
dominoes.

Rescue Mission Seven: Castle castelations!

Run across blocks and escape angry flowers to get over the
obstacles outside the castle. Leap on castle window sills
to reach the top of the castle and save the toys! Flowers
only attack when you get too close, so try to stay as far
away from them as you can!

Rescue Mission Eight: Music maestro please!

Stereo systems, paintbrushes and typewriters were never as
unfriendly as this! Work your way through this factory of
the arts and don't waste time. When you're running on
sheet music, tease enemies forward before jumping to the
next bar.

Rescue Mission Nine: Big top, big hop

Big tops and clowns turn into big problems and frowns in
Dr. Maybe's circus! Get shout out of a cannon and intro
adventure while collecting all you can. You're almost
ready to confront Dr. Maybe! We were not able to obtain
any secret information about this factory, so you'll have
to complete this mission on your own.

Good Luck Robocod.


CONTROLS

Robocod, we realise that your expandosuit will take some getting use to, so
we've compiled this short list of instructions to help you adjust quickly.

Moving Around     To move around, use your joystick to
                  move left and right, push up to jump
                  and bounce around.

Stretch Yourself      Press fire to stretch up. If you extend to a
                      ledge, release fire to grab it - your body
                      automatically snaps up! Then joystick
                      right or left to move sideways. To drop
                      down, pull joystick down. If one of
                      Maybe's meanies bites your tail while
                      you're strechting, you'll snap back down,
                      so time your stretching carefully (for long
                      distance stretching, try wiping out
                      meanies around you before you begin
                      stretching).

Mash Maybe's Meanies  To land on a meanie, push joystick up to
                      jump and right or left to position
	              yourself over them. Pull joystick down in 
		      mid air to compress Robocod and mash
		      the meanie when you land on it. Some
		      meanies only need one hit. Others take
		      more hits before they disappear. Push 
		      joystick up in mid air as you land on a
		      meanie for an extra high rebound!

Look Around           To see the area directly below you, pull
		      joystick down and hold fire button. To
		      get a wider view of the area below you
		      pull down and hold fire, then move 
		      joystick right and left.

WHAT YOU SEE

Each factory is guarded be Dr. Maybe's el-cheapo security systems. Why was it so
cheap? Because it dosen't work in the frozen wasteland of the arcit. The system
has short circuited, allowing you to pass freele from one factory to the next, but
only in order from the ground up. Explore the castle roof tops - you may find some
very interesting nooks and crannies!

Barber Pole Exits     To exit most rooms, walk to the barber
                      pole exit when it's falshing. Sometimes
                      you have to collect all penguin bombs in a 
                      room before the exit flashes, sometimes
                      you won't (in a secret bonus room, for
                      instance, the exit's are always falshing).

Bonus Block           Bumb these blocks from underneath and
                      collect the surprises inside for extra
                      points. Watch out for the black bottles of 
                      poison!

Remaining Chances     Robocod in the corner of your screen
		      tells you how many chances you have left
		      to finish the game. In one hand, Robocod
		      counts down you chances to catch Dr.
		      Maybe. In the other hand, he holds
		      batteries for the expandosuit. Each time
	              one of Maybe's meanies touches you,
		      you lose a battery. When your out of
		      batteries, the suit quits working and you 
		      lose a chance. Stock up on batteries by
		      collecting stars. You have a maximum of
		      four lives and five batteries.

Penguin Bombs         Dr. Maybe's bombs have been disguised
		      as penguins to hinder your rescue
		      attempts. There are anywhere from two to
		      five penguin bombs on each level and
		      you must deactivate all bombs before the
		      barber pole exits flashes. There are no 
		      penguin bombs in bonus rooms.

HIDDEN TREASURES

Power Stars           Pick up power stars fo an extra
	              expandosuit battery

Bullet-proof Armour   Dr. Maybe has scattered suits of armour
		      around different areas of a factory.
		      When you discover a suit of armour, pick
		      it up for temporary protection.

Wing Attachments      Before our scientists could attach your
		      wings, Maybe's meanies stole them and
		      took them to different places around the
		      factory. When you pick them up, wiggle
		      joystick up/down to fly, and left or right
		      to move sideways.

Golden Ankhs          Pick up a golden ankh for an extra life

Umbrellas             When you fall, you fall fast and hard -
		      that's the price you pay for wearing a ton
		      of steel.. pick up umbrellas you find along
		      the way to slow any falls you have. To
		      manoeuvre midfall, just move joystick
		      right or left.
