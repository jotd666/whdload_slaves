 I (StingRay) have redone the patch for the OCS version of this game.
 Old patch didn't have a proper imager so I created a RawDIC imager
 which supports the original and the Kixx budget version. The Kixx budget
 version is actually a stolen Skid Row crack! You will have to re-install
 the game as the patch is now using real files!

 The new patch also has some more trainer options which can be enabled
 with CUSTOM1. If you enable the built-in cheat you can use the
 following keys during game:

 F - toggle flying ability
 C - get car
 P - get plane
 B - get bath tub
 X - move to exit spot - !ATTENTION! This option doesn't seem to be reliable
                         so use at your own risk! Don't ever use it in the
                         boss levels as it doesn't work and causes glitches
                         then. You have been warned!
 M - map selector
 S - save position
 G - go to position
 K - Kill James Pond
F6 - PAL
F7 - NTSC

 Blitter wait patches are only installed on 68010+ machines, you can force
 them on 68000 machines with CUSTOM2.

 Have fun with the game.

*** AGA version ***

v2.0 (11-april-2018) done by JOTD:
 - completely rewritten
 - needs Kick40068.A1200/Kick40068.A4000 file in devs:kickstarts
 - No need to press any key, screen fades automatically at manual protection screen
 - Fixed issue #0002364: fire button not working when using a CD32 joypad
   (was because of wrong OSEmu handling of joypad, my fault, since I wrote that code a looong time ago)
 - updated/redone installer script
 
If you have the previous version, a reinstallation is required
If you can't, unpack the "Robocod" file, and move it to a "data" subfolder
   (requires XFDDecrunch package, get it on aminet)

v1.x (29-june-2007) done by CFou!
 - running with OSEmu
 - Manual protection removed
   
*** CD32 version ***

v1.0 (29-june-2007) done by JOTD:
 - needs Kick40068.A1200/Kick40068.A4000 file in devs:kickstarts
 - No need for CD32 joypad to play the CD32 version (use function keys for extra buttons)


Requirements (AGA & CD³² versions):

 The game requires a installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" or "kick40068.A4000". The image can be extracted from
 a A1200 or A4000 with tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" or "kick40068.A4000.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.
