 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 ECS:
 
 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB Fastmem (plus 3MB for preload)
 
 AGA:
 
 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem (plus 3MB for preload)
 It also requires the AGA chipset.
 
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

Notes from JOTD:

Each time I (seriously) take over a Mr Larmer install I appreciate
the work done by him so much. He was using old ways to fix code
(no patchlists) because it didn't exist yet, but he had a way with
copylock/encryption protections that was just amazing.
He was also a very friendly fellow and gave away all his whdload
source code, so his work can be easily continued & improved.
We miss him.

Upgrading from old installation data:

The old "Jurassic.dxx" legacy from disk2file/JST is no more. Now disks
are named "disk.0" to "disk.4". RawDIC imager creates such files. If you
don't want to reinstall, just rename the prefixes and you're good
to go, the files have the same contents as before!!

which is already cool.
