 Notes:
 
 - the smart bomb wasn't remapped to another CD32 button
   it could have been done, but I didn't dig further into it
 - the music seems to go faster during the intro (first 2 screens)
   & game over sequence at least on WinUAE on fast processors
 - the first level music is reportedly "inspired" by "A Searing Struggle".
   I'd also say it's inspired by Pet Shop Boys "it's a sin".
 - the graphical flashes were finally overcome by adapting Stingray
   vertical position fix to all levels by testing all of them visually
   and adapting the beam wait value individually until all of the are
   okay on a CD32. Also reported to be okay on a 68030.
