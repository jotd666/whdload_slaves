 JAMES POND BACKGROUND:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 James Pond is F.I.5.H.'s top secret agent - so cool, he's glacial.
 Unfailingly polite and unruffled, he's never been seen with a gill out of
 plaice. Pond rubs out enemies with the swish of a fin. As an agent he is
 fishtastic with a 100% success rate. Pond is a master of disguise, a
 fabulous athlete and an accomplished gymnast - his favourite move is the
 double back flipper. He learnt how to wriggle out of tight corners from his
 grandad, the Great Pondini. Whenever world safety is threatened you can bet
 Pond is first on the scene. No mission too dangerous, no location too
 hostile, James Pond is the best.

 James Pond lives and travels in style. His base is a submerged luxury
 liner and his favourite transport is an amphibious Austin Martin Lagoonda.
 Pond's base is crammed full of gob-smacking gadgets and gizmos.

 As well as being an expert with all forms of weaponry, Pond also has a
 formidable arsenal of jokes. His rapier sharp wit rarely misses its target,
 and many a captured villain has heard a knockout punch line just before a
 knockout punch.

 Pond is the world's coolest secret agent. If you haven't heard of him,
 where have you been? If you live in a cave at the summit of an
 undiscovered, unclimbable mountain, then maybe we'll let you off. If not,
 you'd better stop drifting, start swimming with the tide and float with
 JAMES POND.

 FI5H MISSION BACKGROUND AND BRIEFING:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Congratulations on your record-breaking results in the Aquatic Games, but
 now it is time to put your gold medals away. Dr.Maybe has returned to
 threaten world safety!

 Following his defeat at your fins in Robocod, Dr.Maybe adopted a low
 profile. Our special surveillance teams trailed his movements (see report
 from a FI5H Agent below), but their sightings shed little light on any
 plans. We hoped that Dr.Maybe and the criminal cronies at J.A.W.S. were all
 washed up, but this has proved to be far from the truth. Once again Maybe
 is threatening the planet.

 FI5H SURVEILLANCE:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 SUBJECT:       Dr.Maybe

 12.9.92        Reported to F.I.5.H. HQ to receive my assignment - to track
                down Dr.Maybe and keep him under surveillance. I travelled
                to the toy factory where Maybe was defeated by James Pond.
                Picked up Maybe's Arctic escape route but trail soon went
                cold.

 2.11.92        At last I received some news - a tip-off from an informer.
                A J.A.W.S. meeting was rumoured to be taking place at an
                abandoned airport in Death Desert. I took up position and
                waited.

 30.11.92       SUCCESS! After two dusty days on duty I spotted Dr.Maybe
                leaving the meeting. He was heavily disguised but I'd
                recognise that ugly mug anywhere. Maybe roared off at an
                incredible speed. Keeping up proved impossible. As I was
                radioing in my report, I saw a flash of light curving up
                into the sky.

                Since then, no new sightings have been reported. My agent
                instincts tell me something is about to happen. Dr.Maybe
                MUST be planning something big if he's gone to all this
                trouble to evade surveillance.

                Our fears were roused by the sudden disappearance of a
                space shuttle (see newspaper cutting). There is only one
                criminal genius capable of masterminding such an audacious
                act - Dr.Maybe!

 SPACE SHUTTLE SHOCK:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 by ace reporter Lewis Lean

 At 0830 today, NASA confirmed the disappearance of one of their space
 shuttles. Officials were remaining tight lipped about the causes of the
 shuttle's disappearance and about the contents of its cargo hold.

 BALDERDASH

 Mr.Ponsonby-Smythe, a NASA spokesman, denied that the shuttle was on a top
 secret military mission. However, papers in my possession confirm that the
 shuttle's cargo was a spy satellite.

 HAS DR.MAYBE RETURNED?

 Is it possible that Dr.Maybe has returned? NASA's reassurances remain
 deeply unconvincing. My undersea sources have revealed that the aquatic
 agency F.I.5.H. put all operatives on red alert and that their top agent,
 James Pond, is on the verge of wading into action.

 F.I.5.H picked up one of Maybe's known associates. Unfortunately the
 vermin was no squealer. After the coward was tickled into submission they
 discovered vital evidence in his coat pocket. See below.

 Š------------------------------------------------------------------------‹

 I immediately smelt a rat. The evidence we had gathered pointed to one
 thing - Maybe had set up a secret base on the moon. But why? I instantly
 despatched a team of three top agents to the moon. They never arrived! See
 transcript of their last message.

 F.I.5.H. SURVEILLANCE:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 SUBJECT:       Dr.Maybe

 All systems A, OK, we are beginning our orbit of the moon. The dark side
 is just coming into view and... It's amazing! We can see a giant moonbase
 on the surface... crackle zing. Controls are going haywire, we're caught
 in garble garble tractor beam. The radio's being jammed buzz crackle we're
 going...... down......... ahhhhh......... uuuggghhhhhh.........
 hisssssssssssssss.

 Further losses could not be risked. I launched 'Claw' space probes and
 directed spy satellites at the dark side of the moon. The contents of the
 probes, analysed by Dr.Gordon Zola, and the photographs developed by our
 Codak boffins are truly amazing. Detailed results are shown below. They
 prove beyond doubt that the moon is not only made up of cheese, but a whole
 variety of dairy products.

 From our findings we are certain that Dr.Maybe has one aim in mind - to
 mine finest quality Moon Cheese and monopolise the world's cheese markets.
 The effects of this would be devastating. As our top F.I.5.H. operative,
 you have been assigned to Operation Starfi5h. Your mission is to rescue
 fellow agents, destroy Maybe's Cheese mines and defeat Dr.Maybe, but
 beware, it will be no picnic. Unfortunately three of our other agents are
 still missing, one of them Finnius Frog, is vital to the success of the
 mission - rescue Finnius and he'll help you out. Our scientists have
 developed new F.I.5.H. equipment for use in the special moon environment.

 Further details on these subjects as well as detailed moon reports are
 enclosed in this dossier, along with a short Moon acclimatisation
 programme.

 Remember, one fish can make a difference. The world is relying on you.

 EQUIPMENT:
 ~~~~~~~~~
 FI5H experts have identified the following items as essential equipment
 for Operation Starfi5h. Find them as you travel on the moon.

 HELMET

 Gives protection from falling objects and spiked ceilings.

 GATEAUX GUN

 Fires homing cakes, strawberries, oranges, apples and lemons. Collect
 powerups for more ammo - if Pond is holding the gun and he knocks a square
 holding fruit it will flash, this is a powerup.

 UMBRELLA

 Allows Pond to slow down and control his fall.

 DYNAMITE

 Timed to explode after a short delay - the fuse starts to burn as soon as
 Pond collects it.

 FRUIT SUITS

 To wear a Fruit Suit, stand behind it (Pond cannot be carrying an item)
 and press DOWN. When put on they allow the wearer to roll into enemies to
 cause damage. Fruit Suits can also offer an extra protective layer.
 Replenish energy by picking up a matching fruit. Explode the suit by
 pulling DOWN and pressing FIRE (doing so causes it to turn into several
 bullets of the same type of fruit as the fruit suit). Wearing the fruit
 suit allows you to take several hits without any damage, but too many hits
 will destroy the fruit suit. Keep an eye on the number next to the fruit
 in the status panel for the current fruit strength.

 BOMB

 Drop bomb for powerful explosion.

 OTHER PICKUPS:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 TONNE WEIGHT - Makes Pond very heavy and hurts some baddies too.

 HEART - Extra life.

 TEETH - Can be thrown at enemies, but try giving some to Finnius to eat.

 CHEESE - Can be thrown at enemies or Pond can stand on it to jump higher.

 BOOT - Can be thrown at enemies.

 ROCK - Can be thrown at enemies but shatters if dropped too far and Pond
 can stand on it to jump higher.

 FUEL - Fills up thruster.

 T.V. - Can be thrown at enemies, very fragile. If broken a poltergeist
 will chase you. Jump on the poltergeist with the TV pieces to reach higher
 platforms, the poltergeist will then follow Pond if he has picked up the TV
 pieces. Throw the TV pieces away and the poltergeist will return to them.

 POISON - Hurts Pond, but not Finnius.

 FLASHING RED HERRING - Invulnerability.

 Likes: Amphibious manoeuvres.
 Dislikes: Dr.Maybe, any J.A.W.S. operatives.
 Personal Data: Following successful completion of basic training, Finnius
 Frog has been assigned to Operation Starfi5h. Finnius Frog is slower than
 James Pond, but due to immensley powerful back legs, he can leap higher.
 Being smaller than Pond, he can also squeeze through small gaps or spaces.

 Age: Not known.
 Current Address: Secret underwater headquarters.
 Likes: Favourite jokes - I was the flounder of F.I.5.H.

 Admiral talks in nautical terms such as 'Batten down the hatches' whenever
 appropriate.

 Name: Classified: Known only as F.
 Position: Chief of F.I.5.H. Operations world wide.
 History: Information on F is highly classified. His identity is never
 revealed. He keeps his face in the shadow at all times, but can be
 identified by the ring on his finger with the distinctive TOP SECRET
 imprint. F's Offices are inside an aquarium and the walls are lined with
 fish tanks. F briefs all agents for their missions and also supplies them
 with any special equipment. He is quiet, calm and incredibly efFI5Hient.

 J.A.W.S. PERSONNEL FILES:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Dr.Maybe selected the most feared gangsters in the galaxy to join forces
 with him to form J.A.W.S. (JUNTA AGAINST WORLD SAFETY). Headed by Maybe,
 Pond's greatest enemy, JAWS aims are simple: to destroy FI5H and to take
 over the world for its own gain. Shown below is our current intelligence
 on Dr.Maybe.

 Name: Dr.Maybe.
 Age: Unknown.
 Address: Currently - the moon.
 Likes: Attempting to take over the world.
 Dislikes: James Pond and all F.I.5.H agents.
 Personal Data: Dr.Maybe is one of the most dangerous criminals at large
 and is the arch enemy of James Pond. The monocled, mad-cap scientist is the
 founder and chairmadman of J.A.W.S. He has already masterminded two
 attempts to take over the world. Both were foiled by Pond. He has a grudge
 against the world which laughed at his inventions. His fondest wish is to
 turn Pond into FI5H fingers.
 WARNING: This man is dangerous.

 ARTIST BIO:

 Here are some interesting points and hints about James Pond 3:

 *      There are three possible endings.

 *      Pond has more than one objective.

 *      There are over one hundred full levels. Exactly how many,
        even we aren't quite sure!

 *      There are MANY secret routes.

 *      There are countless ways of getting secret bonuses.

 *      Despite appearances, Pond hasn't actually grown feet, his
        anti-gravity boots fit cleverly around the bottom of his fins.

 *      Punching exits at the right time gives you extra points -
        you could even try bouncing on them.

 *      Finnius, being a young frog is yet to grow his teeth, but this
        is the only thing holding back his voracious appetite!

 *      If you come to what appears to be a dead-end, look around for
        hidden blocks.

 *      Watch out for chain reactions!

 *      Some enemies may seem indestructible but careful use of
        explosives may prove effective.

 *      Not every level need be completed to reach Dr.Maybe's lair.

 *      Pond's rocket proximity scanner gives you an idea how close
        to Maybe's base you are.

 *      Pond's girlfriend, Angel Fish is one of the three missing agents.

 *      Collecting moons can offer worthwhile rewards!

 *      Certain items can be used in ways you might not expect!

 *      There are a number of interesting cheats!
