 This install applies to "James Pond 3" © 1993 Millenium Software

 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem (but not AGA)
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

CD32 version:

- This installer requires the James Pond 3 (Operation Starfish) original CD-ROM.
- A joypad is better to be able to play this game, however, I translated the buttons in keys, so
  the game is playable with a joystick and the keyboard.
- Thanx to Walter Gierholz for providing the CD.
