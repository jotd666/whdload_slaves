 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB / 1MB OtherMem
 (depending on the installed version, since there's a version that requires 512k expmem)
 
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 Notes:

 This one was not easy because of all the problems (DMA, blitter, disk accesses,
 disk format). Thanks to WHDLoad developper team, especially Bert & Girv for advice
 on that point.
 The MFM decoding was not a piece of cake either. But recently, as
 I took the job to adapt another version of "The Blues Brothers" install by
 Mr Larmer, I noticed that the track length of the Titus game was special: $1400
 bytes, which is rather odd because custom formats are usually longer than DOS
 tracks (DOS: $1600 bytes). I tried the imager on the James Pond warp file just
 for fun and ... it worked!!! I just had to adapt the imager to the disk map.
 A strange fact since both games (Blues Brothers & James Pond) are not linked by
 coder or by company. (I heard that Thalion used this format too).

 The "mystery" was solved in 2020, when I noticed that SPS release 3137 (Atari ST)
 can be read partially with the .islave file, which means that this $1400-len tracks
 is actually native Atari-ST track :)
 
 There are 2 different slaves in the archive. The "JamesPond1MB.slave" can run all 4 versions
 but requires 512k more fast/chip memory. The "JamesPond.slave" one requires only 512k chip and no
 extra memory but won't run the 1MB version.
 If you install the 1MB version by mistake, you get an explicit error when running whdload, just replace
 the slave by the file "JamesPond1MB.slave".
 
 The install supports 5 different versions. One is a very early non SPS 512k version with a huge
 bug at startup that went unnoticed. Also, in this very version the highscores screen flickers
 a bit with slightly trashed graphics, but I'm leaving it as is for now.
