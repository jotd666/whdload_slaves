The patch can be applied to a already installed version of the game.

Jouster 3 is available on aminet (game/misc/Jouster3.lha)

Features:

- Uses WHDLoad + Kickstart 3.1/KickDOS emulation for clean OS operation/degrading
- WHDLoad quit key added (numerical '*')


Requirements:

 The game requires a installed A1200 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200". The image can be extracted from a A1200 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick344.lha" on aminet.
