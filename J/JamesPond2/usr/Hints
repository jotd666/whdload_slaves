        When you start the game, on the first roof you come to, above a
        sign saying "Arctic Toys" you will find five objects, which are,
        from left to right, an apple, an Earth globe, a cake, a hammer and
        a tap.  The first letters of each of these added together (AECHT)
        is an anagram of the word CHEAT.  Pick up the objects in the correct
        order (Cake, Hammer, Earth globe, Apple and Tap) to recieve an
        invincibility shield lasting 10 minutes.  When the cheat is
        activated, flashing fish form around Robocod, and the music speeds
        up.  Also, if now you go straight into the first room, and then
        exit immediately you will find that all of the castle doors have
        been unlocked, allowing you to access any level.
        
        On the sports equipment level after the second spike are five
        objects in a row, which, in order, are some Lips, a Violin, an
        Earth globe, an Ice-cream and a Snowman.  The first letter of each
        of these added together spells out LVEIS, which is an anagram of
        the word LIVES.  Collect these in the correct order (Lips, Ice
        cream, Violin, Earth and Snowman) for infinite lives.

        In some point of the game (I do not know where), there are five
        objects that spell out the word POWER. Collect them in the
        following order: Penguin, Oil, Wine, Earth and Racquet.

        Going into Map Select mode allows you to leap to various points in
        the game. These are accessed by using the following numbers:

                              (SECRET ROOM LOCATIONS)
        There are two hidden worlds behind the main tower, another sweets
        level (including a Liquorice Allsorts World, the infamous Bouncing
        Jelly World, another Cake World and an upside down Jelly World)
        and an extra scrolling section. To reach them, run along the ground
        floor - avoiding the doors - then go up and over the first flight
        of stairs.  From the bottom of the second (smaller) tower, make
        your way up to the landing above Dr. Maybe's final door and run left
        into the wall.  You'll disappear behind the screen and arrive in the
        Secret Tower room.  But who is Katie? 

        Once you've  finished the bath level, drop down to the bottom of the
        castle, and walk left until you get to the small snowman statues.
        Jump on these and they'll turn into a moving platform.  Once you get
        to the top of the screen, walk left into thin air and jump.  By now
        you should be next to some doors.  Go through them for bonus city!!

        Go to the same place after finishing the circus room (the last room
        before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden snowmen again.
        A platform made of two bonud blocks should float upwards, revealing
        a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more extra lives and
        stars.
    
        Do as above after the sweets level, but go to the left of the
        castle.  Go on the snowmen once more, and at the top of the screen
        grab the umbrella and collect all the goodies while you're floating
        down.

        On the second teddy bear level, keep jumping over the spikes until
        you see a hole above you.  Jump through this and catapult yourself
        off the bus there. Once you've done this, get on the higher level
        and keep walking left, bounce on the trampoline and collect the
        wings.  Now fly along the top of the screen to the right and you
        should find a different exit.  Go through this for a special bonus
        level. 

        Complete a level with does not feature a guardian and you will
        always find something new when you return to the castle "selection"
        screen.  In one case you will find a whole sequence of lifts and
        things (see above) that lead to a door that you cannot normally get
        to.  If you go to the very right of the factory screen and look down
        you will see a load of crowns, which you can access after coming
        back from other levels.

        It is possible to finish Robocod by only doing half the levels.  A
        choice of two new doors to enter is given when the correct level is
        completed.  Start by completing the Fluffy Toys one and then by
        doing the Cars one.

        Finish the bath levels and as soon as you come out of the door run
        straight to the golden snowmen in the bottom far left outside the
        castle.  Jump into these snowmen and you'll float upwards to the top
        of the screen where you'll be met by a door.  Getting through this
        door is tricky but worth it.  Inside are loads of extra lives and
        energy stars.  Go to the same place after finishing the circus room
        (the last room before the end of game baddy) and stand on the golden
        snowmen again.  A platform made of two bonus blocks ahould float
        upwards revealing a secret tunnel.  At the end of this are even more
        extra lives and stars.
