 This install applies to "Dungeon Master" © 1986-1992 FTL/Software Heaven

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

History:

 version 2.0 (29.12.2022) done by JOTD:
 - dropped disk images for real files (reinstall needed from "disk.1" file),
   also fixes the "savegame corrupt bug" when using diskimages which is
   a nice bonus (I didn't remember that this bug existed)
 - selectable save slots (rename DMGAME.DAT in DMGAME_0.DAT from
   your existing "disk.2" image.

 
 version 1.3 (20.05.2020) done by JOTD:
 - added trainer: no damage for the party (issue #0004682)
 - removed checksums that prevented proper game training
 
 version 1.2 (19.01.2014) still done by JOTD
 - really removed 68020+ restriction (issue #1556)
 - fixed access fault at startup (issue #2736, #2065, #2072)
 - source code included
 
 version 1.1 (15.05.2009) done by JOTD
 - removed 68020+ restriction (bug #1556)
 - converted to WHDLoad v16

 version 1.0 (2001) done by JOTD
 - initial release
 - Runs fully from HD using WHDLoad & KickEmu
 - Convenient install script
 - Load/Save on HD
 - Cache flushes added to use caches/fast memory
 - Quit key (numerical '*', or configurable with QUITKEY)
 - Walkthrough/doc/hints included

Notes:

- Only re-release is supported right now (FTL/Psygnosis, V3.6, 1992)
  V1.0 and V2.x are not supported right now, but that could change as
  the first step was to get more control on the game loader, which is now
  done with the conversion from diskimage to files.
- Trainer gives infinite stamina, but is not perfect. Other player stats may be lowered.
