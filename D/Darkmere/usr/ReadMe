 That install applies to "Darkmere" © 1992/93 Core Design - 4 disks
 Slave requires WHDLoad V19+.
 Game needs 512k Chipmem, 1Mb fastmem & about 3Mb of Fastmem (for preload option)
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 History
 -------

 version 2.0 (21.02.2021) done by JOTD
 - fixed memory allocation (caused fatal issues at level 2)
 - self-modifying code properly fixed (no more cache flush)
 - more efficient blitterwaits
 - selectable trainer: infinite magic, advice, and energy
 - checks "SaveDisk" at startup (else it's not possible to create it, thus
   not possible to save to hard disk afterwards!)
 - access fault properly fixed
 - uses only 512k of chip memory, and fast memory for the program (faster)
 - stack relocated in fast memory
 - added joypad controls, game is now fully controllable with joypad. With pre-set
   savegames, it is even possible to play on a CD32 using whdload or cd32load (untested)
 - non-empty savegame file with start of levels 2 and 3 provided (thanks kremiso@eab)
 - readme reworked
 - toggleable save to hard disk or floppy with CUSTOM5=1 and
   F9 key. Press F9 to toggle to floppy (red flash), press F9
   to toggle back to hard drive (green flash). That allows to load
   a saved game from floppy and save it back to hard drive (by losing
   one magic or potion, that's true... unless trainer is on) or the
   other way round, but you can use infinite magic for this.
   This is a debug option only.
 
 version 1.2 (18.02.2016) done by Wepl
 - made 68000 compatible and added quitkey
 - selection for the splash window added
 - solution added
 - updated install script, copies two files less

 version 1.1 (3.7.2006) done by Wepl
 - taglist termination fixed
 - decruncher speedup, slave is cacheable now
 - now default is save to hard drive, not to floppy
 - docs and icons added
 - new install script
 - slave source included

 version 1.0 done by MiCK
 - RN disk protection removed
 - Savegames redirected to HD
 - Music player fixed
 - Blitter waits inserted
 - Cool Icons (created by Frank)
 - Some access faults fixed
 - Decrunch routine relocated in fastmem
 - CUSTOM1 tooltype can be used to load/save games from HD or floppy
   (0=hd ; 1=floppy)
 - Infinite help (advice & magic)

 CD32 joypad controls:

 - controls menu: blue (space)
 - pause: play (P)
 - english: yellow (1)
 - french: green (2)
 - german: reverse (3)
 - italian: forward (4)
 - quit to wb: reverse+forward+yellow (quitkey)

 note: old savegames could be an issue, specially on level 2. Some users had gone
 pretty far in the game, then got stopped by unexplained crashes. Fixing the memory
 allocation fixed some crashes but the game state was still corrupt. That didn't
 happen with floppy versions (well, it appears that it does, actually!),
 but was tested fully working now with bigger memory allocation.
 
 That bug also explains why I didn't shave the memory requirements too close,
 requiring 1MB fast instead of the standard 512k. It could work with 512k fast only
 but since the symptom is corrupt gamesaves after hours of play, I'm not going to
 gamble on that. Rebuild the slave with 512k fast if you want, and try to complete the
 game, I'm interested in the results.
