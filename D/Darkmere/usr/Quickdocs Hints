                           SOUTH WALL STREET                    


   your mission is to kill the dragon ENYWAS
   in order to do that you must first leave the village through the gate
   BUT the gatekeeper won't let you go unless you have the PASSWORD
   in order to get the PASSWORD you must go to the gatekeeper's BROTHER
   you'll find his BROTHER at the TOLK INN on the EAST ROAD
   (if he isn't there yet , walk around or complete on of the other missions) 
   BUT he won't talk unless you give him something to drink
   so give him a bottle of beer or orc ale or something like that
   he then will tell you he only wonts to drink SKULLBUSTER
   ( note : if you don't talk to him your character will not now what do 
   in certain parts of the game) 
   so you go to the barkeeper for some SKULLBUSTER ( question : SKULLBUSTER)
   he will tell you that he needs a special HERB to make skullbuster
   so you must go to the farmacy (apotheker)(kelorn street) to get that herb
   b|ut then you must pass the MAD KNIGHT on the bridge (avon road)   
   he will let you pass if you give him a battle axe , so first you must find
   a battle axe
   you'll find a BATTLE AXE at the ARMOURERS (south wall street)
   there are two ways to get it:
    - or you open the chestcase with a chest key and steel (search:take)
      the battle axe and  then kill the barbarian that then comes to kill you
    - or you find 20 goldpieces and trade a battle axe
   then give the BATTLE AXE to the MAD KNIGHT and go to the farmacy and ask 
   for the special HERB 
   he will tell you then that his THREE POTION BOTTLES are stolen and that you
   must RETRIEVE THEM in order to get your HERB
   ok , how to find these potion ?????
   from time to time you'll see a HOODED MAN standing in the streets
   there are three hooded men and each of them has one of the potions
   find and KILL THEM , than SEARCH their CORPSES and you'll find each time
   one of the potions , keep searching for hooded men untill you have all
   three of the potions 
   ( note:if you encounter a hooded man during the game ,kill him , this
   way you'll already have one of the potions) 
   then return to the farmacy and give him his THREE POTIONS and he'll give you 
   your HERB that you need to make SKULLBUSTER (search : take) 
   return to the TOLK INN and give the HERB to the BARKEEPER
   he then will make SKULLBUSTER for you (search:take)
   give the SKULLBUSTER to the gatekeepers BROTHER (inventory:give)
   and he will give you the PASSWORD
   then go to the GATEKEEPER and he will let you through BUT first you
   must go to the TEMPLE (algen street) to save the priest from 2 orcs
   kill these orcs and
   go back to the gatekeeper and he will let you through (taking all your
   possesions from you)

 ROTTING 
 GLADE
                                                                                                              
   to kill the dragon ENYWAS you'll need a stronger sword
   the mage MALTAR can make a special potion to do this BUT he will
   need three special ingredients : -the horn of a unicorn
                                    -a piece of a mushroom
                                    -and a dragons bone
   well now , when you enter level 2 and walk down the old road it will 
   seem like there's now way out . well , that's because the path is hidden in the
   screen where the stones block your way (atleast somewhere overthere)
   look for a skull lying seperatly next to the road
   DESTROY this SKULL with your sword and the PATH will be CLEAR
   in the game there are a few times that you'll have to do the same thing
   ( destroy the skull that's blocking your road , I mean )
   there are also HIDDEN PATHWAYS . look on your map , if you see a road on
   the map that isn't there on your monitor then that means it's hidden
   orientate yourself on the map and search for the hidden path (note :
   it usualy is hidden BEHIND the BUSHES ) keep searching , eventualy you will
   find it . ( so if you have a printer , print out this text )
   sometimes you will encounter an UNDEAD , well now , this is a problem
   because they are hard to kill but I will give you some tips:
    - some of them have a BLIND SPOT in their corner next to them
      find and stand in that blind spot in you can easely kill them
      whitout getting hit yourself
    - if you can't find a blind spot and your running LOW ON ENERGY , leave
      the screen , eat or drink something to RESTORE ENERGY , you can even
      drink a strength potion if you think you can't survive an other attack
      ( you could even drink a time reserve potion to save your current 
      potition if you are afraid that you're gonna die and have to start all
      over again at your last saved position ) 
      then aproach the undead as quick as you can and keep hitting him
      don't let yourself get driven away by him , keep close to him     
      and watch you energy (you could even search for an orc or an ogre
      and kill them to restore energy , when you killed him and you're still
      low on energy ,you can repeatedly go out of the screen and back in to it
      untill the orc or ogre is back so you can kill him again to gain more
      energy
   also nice to know: through the map flows a river and almost on every
   bridge stands a GUARD , to get by this guard you need to GIVE HIM MONEY
   ( to buy him of ) you can pay in ingots (1) , gold pieces (7) or silver 
   bags (3)
   next , the level itself:
   first go to the ELVENVILLAGE and talk to the OLD ELVE (question:maltar)
   he must give you the PASSWORD to cross the QUICKSAND infront of maltar's
   castle 
   then go to the quicksand infront of maltar's castle and do inventory:say
   a bridge will appear , go to maltar and talk to him
   then go to the SPIDERS GLADE
   these spiders are very dangerous when you come to near to them
   the best way to get rid of them is to throw a dead rabbit at them
   so while your walking around in this level ,kill every rabbit that you
   encounter and pick them up , then when your in the
   spiders glade do inventory:throw
   the spider will then dissappear , but don,t get to close to them ,i've
   warned you , they are really hard to kill with your sword , keep your 
   distance and then throw the rabbit (one per spider )
   now , look on your map for a hidden pathway (where the road takes a turn ) 
   this pathway is covered with a SPIDERWEB 
   you must destroy this web with your sword , this path leads to the dragons
   grave yard , on the right side of the grave yard you'll find a DRAGON BONE
   (search : take) this is the one maltar needs
   now , go to the ELVE ON the RIVERSIDE (see map) and talk to her 
   ask all kind of  questions 
   then ,  go to the rotting glade and talk to the elve on the 
   mushroom , she will tell you that you can get a PIECE OF MUSHROOM 
   if you FREE HER SISTERS from the orcs that are holding them captured
   now you should go to the orcs outpost (see map )  but it is better if 
   you first go to the UNICORN and talk to him,he will tell you that you'll
   get his horn if you kill the orcs that attacked him , well now , go to
   orcs outpost (see map ) and kill the orcs that are holding the elves 
   captured , these orcs are the same as the ones that attacked the 
   unicorn so you can go back to the UNICORN and collect his HORN and you
   can go back to the rotting glade and collect the PIECE OF MUSHROOM
   now you have all three pieces that you need (mushroom , horn , bone)
   now , go back to tha mage MALTAR and give him these ingredients
   your sword is now strong enough to kill the dragon enywas
   he will also give you a MAGICAL SPELL so you can travel faster
   go to the stone circle and do inventory:say
   now follow the road and enter the skull cave
   CONGRATULTIONS , YOU NOW HAVE MADE IT TO THE THIRD LEVEL !!!!!!!!

   this level is very simple                                                                                                    
   1. go to the LIBRARY (see map) and do search:read:book
      ( don't forget to pick up keys to open the doors )
   2. go to the TEMPLE (see map) and KILL the ORC 
      pick up the DAGGER                         
   3. go to the other chasm (not the one that's near the temple but the other
      one ) the door is now open 
   4. KILL the GUARDS and then COLLECT and EXAMINE KEYS , each key is for a
      certain prison cell , open the cells and FREE the PRISONERS
      as you'll see there's no key for door number 11
      well now the prisoners in door number 10 have that key 
      they will give it to you when you talk to them 
      now you can open door number 11 (inventory:use)                        
      talk to this prisoner and he will give you the combination to operate
      the lift
   5. go to the LIFT and do inventory:use ( I think )                                     
      now get into the lift and go up                                                 
      IMPORTANT : YOU MUST HAVE FULL ENERGY BEFORE GOING UP , IF NOT YOU MIGHT
                  JUST NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THERE ALIVE
   6. follow the path until you're at a door , put the dagger into the slot 
      the door will now open                        
      (NOTE : it is adviced to drink a time reserve potion before going in
              and to save your current position , so if you should not make it
              you can always reload the game at this position )
   7. enter the door and kill the 16 LITTLE DRAGONS , then kill the BIG DRAGON
      (NOTE: believe it or not but the big dragon has a BLIND SPOT)
