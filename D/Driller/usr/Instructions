INTRODUCTION
------------
This document assumes a basic knowledge of the gameplay of DRILLER, as
given in the program manual.

Control of the game is, at present, via keyboard or mouse-driven icons.
The keyboard controls mimic exactly what the icons do.  Here is a summary
of control.  The "Btn" column indicates which button on the mouse should be
pressed to perform the function - most icons are dual purpose, the usual
function being accessed using the LEFT mouse button.
