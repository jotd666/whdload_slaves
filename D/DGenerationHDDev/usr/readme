- Convenient install script
- Copylock protection removed (present only in ECS version)
- Saves to HD (as the original did)
- Quit key (numerical '*', or configurable with QUITKEY)

Features (CD남 version):

- Runs fully from HD using WHDLoad/KickEmu31
- Convenient install script
- Saves to HD (in "nvram" file, thanks to new Wepl nonvolatile.s code)
- Joypad supported and emulated with function keys (F1-F6)
- Quit key (numerical '*', or configurable with QUITKEY)
- Doc/Hints/Walkthrough included

History:

- v2.4 (CD32 only): fixed savegames that didn't work
  game needs reinstalling, else just copy "nvram" in "data"
  seems that v2.0 install fix didn't fix after all, or that a whdload change about empty directory read
  broke the savegames. Anyway, all good now (note: don't leave Alt-S pressed too long else it will save
  a lot of times. Press any other key to stop that side effect)
- v2.3 (AGA only): super cheat mode: selectable number of lives, infinite power weapons & more
- v2.2: rewritten ECS/AGA versions for WHDLoad v17 (now ECS version has quit key on 68000, issue #003583)
- v2.1: rewritten CD32 version for WHDLoad v16
- v2.0: new ECS, AGA & CD남 slaves,
  no more KickDOS stuff, shorter & faster slaves,
  CD남 version supports real joypad.
  CD남 users will have to reinstall the game in order to be able to save games
  (or the game will tell 'Game Save Locked')
- v1.3: fixed AGA slave. No more OS swaps now. Locked whdload versions below 15
  for AGA/CD남 slaves
- v1.2: fixed ECS slave. CTRL-Q now quits, and if you save and the SAVE.DAT file
  is not in the directory, the game still saves. Added AGA floppy version.
- v1.1: added CD남 version, which uses Kick 3.1
- v1.0: initial release

Notes:

- Should run on original & cracks.
- Read the documentation for load/save keys. Don't mix up Alt-R and CTRL-R
  (someone will recognize himself :))
- All versions now need WHDLoad v17.

Requirements (ECS version, SPS 677):

 The game requires a installed A500 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


Requirements (AGA version SPS 457/CD남 version):

 The game requires a installed A1200 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200". The image can be extracted from a A1200 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

Thanks to Bert Jahn for writing kickemu.s kickstart interface system.
