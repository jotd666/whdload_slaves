	That install applies to "Deep Core" © 1993 ICE


	That install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.


	You need 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing Help (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=")


    If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
    version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
    some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
    that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
    can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
    at http://mantis.whdload.de
