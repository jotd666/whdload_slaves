                          DREAMWEB MULTI-SOLUTION!

                                DREAMWEB 1
                                ----------

Door:As you stand at the foot of the door you see it stretch high above your
head. The door is only about four feet wide but must be at least twenty feet
tall. Its surface is blank.
:You place your hands on the door....

Vines:Surrounding the seventh and most impressive doorway in these tunnels
are long green tendrils. You aren't sure what they are but they seem to move
very slowly of their own accord.
:They seem to be growing!

Gate:Across this large doorway is a gate with a lock on it. The bars are
rusted with age and damp to the touch. From the darkness beyond you hear
distant screams.
:You try and push the gate open but it is firmly locked.

Chain:One of four stone chains used to suspend a central orb from the
ceiling. The chains are joined firmly to the wall and are intricately carved.
:The chain is too high to reach.

Orb:Above your head in the centre of the room is a clear orb suspended in a
stone ring. The stone ring is held in place by four long chains coming from
four corners of the room.
:The orb is too high to reach.

THE DREAMWEB:You stand at a junction where the ceiling is a huge dome.
Suspended above your head is a glass sphere held within stone chains. The
chains reach from four corners of the room. As you walk your footsteps echo
loudly through the chamber.

THE DREAMWEB:You stand in one corridor of the Dreamweb. There are two doors
in the south wall and overhead there is a stone archway. The ceiling is very
high and the walls are rough stone blocks that are cold and slightly damp to
the touch.

Crystal:As you hold the crystal in your hand it glows a strong purple
colour. You feel the power  of  the Dreamweb pulsating through the
crystal.
:Now is not the time to use the power of the crystal
:You hold the crystal firmly and raise your arms...


                               THE DREAMWEB 2
                               --------------

Stone slab:The huge piece of stone is so highly polished that it looks as if
its surface is mirrored. In the centre is a stone plinth.
:The plinth looks more important than the slab.

Plinth:A stone plinth that stands about four feet high. It has what looks
like a keyhole in the top.:That doesn't seem to work.
:You take your key and place it on the plinth.

THE DREAMWEB:This room has an air of importance. The focus is a stone plinth
about three feet high in the centre of the room. This must be the gateway
back to the real world. There is a smell of sulphur in the air and you feel
a distant vibration.
