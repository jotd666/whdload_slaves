                               THE POOL HALL
                               -------------

Assistant:Behind the glass an assistant leafs through a magazine. He is
about fifty years old and has ginger hair and small round glasses. He is sat
with his chin in his hands and pays little attention to you.

Look, I'm sorry pal. If you're after a new membership I can't issue any 'til
next week.
Actually I've got a friend's card here.
You can use someone else's card if you like. If it's OK by them, it's OK by
me.
Won't the electronic thumbprint on the card be wrong if I use this card
though?
Look, I shouldn't be doing this, but if you use your card in the reader by
the doors I'll sort out the rest.
Yeah, thanks. I'll do that.
No problem, you can owe me one....
Look mate, stop hanging around here. If ya get a card then I'll let you in!
OK, just checking...

Light:A small round red sign that is lit from behind. The sign says "Join
Now" in large black letters.
:The sign has no switch. It must be controlled from inside the booth.

Neon light:A rectangular green neon light that casts an eerie green glow.
The light has no use, except for lighting the approach to the pool hall.

Hatch:By the entrance to the pool hall is a small hatch in the wall that has
bars over the windows. Behind the bars sits a man who is reading a magazine.
:You lean on the hatch momentarily.

Sign:Fixed to the front of the booth is a sign that is lit with yellow neon.
:The sign says "Memberships and Information".

Lift control:The lift control has a number of lights on it. Each has a
legend printed beneath it. One green light flashes that says "Basement".
:You press the green flashing light and you hear a beep.

Pipe:The alleyway here has a multitude of these huge metal pipes running
above it. The pipes are a dull grey metal and brackets with large bolts fix
them in place.
:The pipe is too high to reach.

Ledge:From the building next to you there comes a ledge which is about six
feet above your head. The ledge is made of interlocking metal pieces.
:The ledge is too far above you to reach.

Grille:A drain cover is set into the floor. The rain water floods into it.
:You grasp a couple of the bars on the grille and pull. It lifts a little but 
it's extremely heavy and you lose your grip.

Girder:Overhead is a girder that seems to serve no purpose. It emerges from
the building next to you and disappears off into the rain as it crosses over
the street.
:You can't reach it.

Lift doors:The lift doors are covered in an odd purple plastic material.
Attempts have been made to vandalise the doors but the surface seems almost
indestructible.
:The lift doors are controlled by the box next to them.

Reader:On the wall is a small device flashing the message "Insert Membership
Card".
:You slide the membership card into the reader and the doors open.
:The reader won't work because Louis's card doesn't recognise your thumb print.

POOL HALL LIFT:This lift leads down to the pool hall. There is a control box
on one wall. The floor has a geometric design stamped into it and is made of
a grey resin.

OUTSIDE POOL HALL:You stand in the street outside the pool hall. A dark
alleyway leads off to one side where you can see dim neon lights. The
pavement is cracked and pitted from years of use.

ABOVE POOL HALL:The alleyway above the pool hall leads to some lift doors.
There is a hatch next to these where a man sits. Pipes of varying sizes pass
overhead and beneath your feet the pavement has almost disintegrated.




                                 POOL HALL
                                 ---------

Mr. Silverman:The pool hall owner sits behind his desk and puffs on a large
cigar. He wears an off white shirt and a blue waistcoat. He drums his
fingers on the desk in an irritated manner. He looks as if he doesn't trust
you.

Good evening. My name is Silverman. What's yours?
Oh, my name is Ryan and I need your help. Louis King is a friend of mine, he
said you would have what I want.
Your friend Louis was right, I can usually help people out, providing they
have enough money.
Oh yes, I have money, I just hope I have enough.
And you're after a handgun of some kind, yes?
Yeah, something that's easy to use. I've never used a gun before but I need
to now. I need to kill a m...
Please, Ryan, don't tell me any more than I need to know. I can supply you
with a gun. What you do with it is up to you.
How much will it cost?
For 200 I can give you an SI140. It's a fully automatic pulse laser weapon
with a full pack of ammunition and computerised sights.
Er, that sounds fine, I guess.
A child could use it. The gun virtually aims and fires for you. Will this
weapon be acceptable?
It'll be fine, thanks.
If you'd just like to put your cashcard through the scanner on the desk,
I'll deduct the money.Ok, and thanks for your help Mr. Silverman.
That's allright, give Louis my regards when you see him...

Mr. Silverman gives you a cool stare and asks you once again to use your
cashcard.
Perhaps you should do as he says.

Man:The man lies slumped across the table. Like most of the people here he's
wearing just jeans and a shirt. On his wrist he wears a large wristwatch.

The man doesn't make a move as you approach him.
Excuse me, can you help?
The man mutters something slurred and incomprehensible.
Hey! Wake up!
There is no response.
Oh forget it....

Man:Sat at the bar, facing out across the room, is a man who looks as if
he's in deep thought. He drums his fingers on the bar and is looking blankly
across the room. His clothes look expensive and he wears a gold ring.

As you approach the man sat at the bar he gives you a stern look.
Excuse me.
The man continues talking to the person next to him and ignores you.
Look. Can you help me?
The man stops talking, turns around and bares his teeth.
Er, right. I think I'll be going...

The man ignores you as you walk up to him.
I think I'd better leave him alone. He looks annoyed.

Man:Sat at the bar is a man drinking. He wears a pair of jeans and a black
shirt. His blond hair is long and untidy. He is in conversation with the
bartender as you approach him.

Hey. I'm talking! Why don't you piss off?
But...
I don't wanna have to tell you twice.
Alright, see ya.

Are you deaf?
No, I just.., I mean. Oh forget it.

Bartender:The bartender stands behind the bar lazily smoking a cigarette and
speaking in a low voice to the man opposite him. As you approach he looks at
you with suspicion.

"What can I get you?" says the bartender with a smirk.
I've been told I can get some help here.
Oh Yeah? By who?
Er, my friend's name is Louis, Louis King. He told me to mention his name.
Louis King? Yeah, I've seen him around here a few times, what exactly are
you looking for?
I need a gun, I mean..... I don't know much about them, but I need one.
Well, Mr. Silverman deals with all that, you'll need to see him in his
office. The number for the door lock is 5222.
How will he know who I am?
I'll ring through and tell him you're on your way and that you know Louis.
The office is down to your right and make sure you have some money.
Oh right, I will.... and thanks.

Hey! I thought I told you to go to Mr. Silverman's office, he's expecting
you.
Don't worry, I'm on my way.
Well, just make sure you have some money. He doesn't like being messed
about.

Man:A bald-headed man sits at the table smoking. The man watches you as you
approach and doesn't seem too pleased that you've chosen to speak to him. He
wears a sleeveless shirt and has arms like tree trunks.

Whadya want?
I need some information.
People 'round here just keep themselves to themselves. It doesn't pay to ask
questions.What do you mean?
What I mean is, if you keep asking questions someone will shut you up....
Permanently.
I see. Catch you later...
I doubt it.

Are you trying to make trouble?
No, my mistake. See you later.
Not if I see you first.

Man:Stood in one corner of the room on his own is a man who looks nervous.
He swaps his balance from foot to foot and glances around the room
furtively. He has a tattoo on his arm and he has long dark hair.

What the hell are you lookin' at?
Erm, I just wanted...
Look, I'm just waiting here for someone and I don't wanna be disturbed. Got
it?
Er.... yeah, OK.

Look, I've told you, now get lost.
Ok, I got the message.

Woman:A young woman sits by one of the small tables at the edge of the room.
As you walk about the room she watches what you are doing, and talks to the
man who is with her.

Heavy:Stood in front of a door close to the desk is a man dressed entirely
in black, with black shades, black shoes and with a black expression on his
face. He looks as if he would very much like to rip your head off.

Silverman's security guard stares at you with a stony expression.
I don't think he wants to talk to me...

Bartender:The bartender scowls as he sees you again and he drums his fingers
on the bar in an irritated manner. You approach him uncertainly.

Listen buddy, you've got what you wanted so make yourself scarce. We don't
need any unwanted attention OK?
Sorry, I just wanted to ask if I could have a drink.
No you can't. Now get lost.

Mr. Silverman:Silverman looks at you with a great deal of suspicion. He
puffs away on a large cigar and his hands grip the chair arms so tightly
that his knuckles have turned white.

Ryan, now that I have given you what you want I'd appreciate it if you would
leave as soon as possible.
OK, I'm just leaving...

Light::You look around but you can't see any switch.

Light:A small round disc of purple fluorescent light that casts a small
amount of light across the wall and ceiling.
:You can't reach the light.

Lift doors:The lift doors stand open. The front has a blue covering but the
material is torn in places.
:The doors are automatic.

Lift doors:The lift doors are sturdy and reach to the top of the lift. The
surface is smooth and unmarked metal. Through the doors you can see the bar.
:The lift doors will close when you select a floor.

Lift control:The control panel has a red flashing light on it. The words
"Street level" are written below it and the light doubles as a button.
:You press the red light firmly and the lift makes a beep.

Monitor:Suspended from the ceiling on a metal arm is a monitor. The TV
picture is unstable and the reception poor. The case is battered and marked
and a small read light flickers below the screen.
:Someone has broken the channel change switch.

Pool table:You run your hand over the pool table and you can't believe the
state it's in. The blue felt has several large tears in it and the ball
spots are barely visible.
:Looking around, you can't see a cue. Most of them have probably been taken 
by the police as evidence in various cases of GBH.

Shelf::You can find no use for the shelf.

Table::There isn't any reason for you to sit at a table.

Table::The table is already occupied.

Table::There isn't any use for the table.

Table:The decor in the bar is very strange. The table is made of a hard
plastic and is etched with deep grooves that make a geometric design. The
purple wall lighting is reflected dimly on the table.
:Why not go to the bar if you want a drink.

Seat::You don't need to sit down here.

Seat:You don't think it would be a good idea to crowd the people near this
seat.

Seat::This seat is already occupied.

Seat:This seat is occupied already.

Seat:There isn't much point in just sitting around.

Seat::Perhaps you ought to spend as little time as possible in here.

Shelf::You can't find any use for the shelf.

Shelf::You don't need to do that.

Shelf:Anyone who wishes to stand up can put their drink on one of these
shelves. The shelf fits neatly into the right angle of the wall and there is
a small bright purple light embedded in the front of the shelf.
:You lean casually on the shelf.

Neon sign:A green neon sign on the wall that says "POOL" in letters about 6
inches high.
:There isn't any use for the sign.

Neon sign:A read neon sign on the wall behind the bar says "BUDWEISER" in
large letters. The sign lights up the glasses stacked below it with red light.
:There is no use for the light.

Monitor:This monitor is suspended from the ceiling on a metal arm. A wire
runs from the back of the monitor and disappears into the ceiling. A light
flashes just below the screen.
:You press the on switch but nothing happens.

Toilet:The toilet here is in a disgusting mess. In fact, you can hardly
bring yourself to even look at it, let alone actually use it.
:There's no way I'm going anywhere near that!Sink
:This grubby little sink has a crack in it so large that any water that runs 
into it leaks onto the floor almost straight away.
:The sink is more or less useless.Tap
:A stumpy stainless steel mixer tap that is fixed above the sink. The tap 
looks as if it could fall off the wall at any moment.
:You turn on the tap and some water runs into the sink, through the crack in 
the sink and onto the floor.

Holder:A grey plastic toilet roll holder with a very small amount of paper
on it.
:There is no need to do that.

Toilet:There are three of these urinals in the toilet and they all look
equally dirty. The bowls are cracked with age.
:You don't want to, at least, not here.

Desk:The room is dominated by a large wooden desk with a highly polished
top. On the desk is a card scanner and a computer terminal. Behind the desk
sits the owner of this pool hall.
:You go to lean on the desk but think better of it.

Bar::There isn't much room at the bar for you to lean against it.

Bar:The bar is made from the same material as the tables here. It is just
above waist height and the barman behind it stands higher than you. There
are several people sat at the bar.
:There isn't much room at the bar.

Card scanner:A large white card-reading machine that removes money from
cashcards. The front has a display screen on it that currently lists the
prices of various drinks.
:I don't really want a drink right now.

Pump::If you want a drink use the card scanner to pay for one.

Pump:A beer pump that has the name of the beer lit up on the front panel. On
the back of the pump is a small control switch that controls the flow of beer.
:You must buy a drink if you want one.

Seat:A small circular seat covered in black leather that stands on a single
steel leg that is bolted to the floor.
:You look around the bar and decide that you ought to get in and out of here 
as quickly as possible.

Hand drier:On the toilet wall you see a hand-drying machine. It has a list
of rather obvious instructions on it that tell you to place your wet hands
under the vent.
:You place your hands under the drier and it quickly dries your hands.

Trivia machine:This machine has seen better days but it still seems to
work.
:Pressing a button the machine asks "What is 88137283 divided by 27?" Seems a 
bit tricky doesn't it?

Shelf::Someone is stood in front of the shelf, so you can't get to it.

Shelf:In each corner of the room, opposite the bar is a shelf that can be
used for putting drinks on. There is a purple light fitted into the front of

Keypad:On the wall next to the door is a small metal box with a standard
keypad on it. A thick wire leaves the box at one side and disappears into
the wall.

scribbling down notes. The paper is held in place by triangular metal
brackets at each corner.
:You try and read some of the writing on the blotter but you can't make it out.

Clock:A clock with a digital readout that shows the date and the time in
blue letters. The clock has a polished wooden case.
:You begin to reach out towards but you notice Mr. Silverman's icy gaze and 
think better of it.

Chair:A large black leather chair that looks very well padded. It sits on a
metal leg that sits on a star shaped foot and rocks back and forwards
occasionally as the pool hall owner watches you.
:The chair is already in use!

Light::The lights must be controlled from a central point in the room
somewhere, probably behind the desk.

Light::There isn't any visible control for the light.

Light::The light is controlled from elsewhere in the room.

Light::You can't see any controls but you suspect they are within reach of
the desk somewhere.

Light:You can't see any controls.

Light:This yellow neon light has an orange tinge to it and is one of many 
that light this small room. The light is quite dim because of the number 
of lights here.
:Looking around you see no controls.

Monitor:Silverman has a Network monitor that seems to be displaying
financial news. He has a top of the range LEK model with high resolution
colour graphics.
:Silverman has the controls somewhere within his desk.

Console:A computer console that has its own tiny screen and a cramped
keyboard. The screens occasionally scrolls up new information.
:Touching the keyboard would be an extremely foolish thing to do.

Intercom:A square plastic intercom with a grille at the bottom and several
button on its front.
:You press the button on the intercom.

Plant:A green pot plant with wide green leaves that sits in a small plant
pot.

:Leaning forwards slightly you try and read the printout, but the printing 
is upside down and you can't make it out.

Water dispenser:The glass water dispenser is about half full of clear water.
The dispenser stands on a tall wooden table.
:You should concentrate on the job in hand.

Card scanner:A standard card-scanning machine that has a slot along the
front for a card to be  swept  through. The display on the front
intermittently flashes messages across its face.
:I'd better speak to Silverman first....

Notice board:On the wall you see a black and white map of the city. The map
is dotted with small drawing pins, each with a coloured head.
:You scrutinise the map but you can't really see what it is used for.

Door:The door is controlled by the keypad on the wall next to it. Use the
keypad to enter the correct code and the door will unlock and then open.
:Use the keypad, not the door.

Door::The door has no controls.

too.

wall flashes a light. Through the doors you can see the bar.

small door in one of the walls with an intercom next to it. The door has a
sign that says "Mr. Silverman" in small neat letters.

POOL ROOM:This pool room is lit by purple neon strip lights that eerily
light the purple carpets. In the centre of the room is a pool table covered
with blue cloth that is now torn and stained.

POOL HALL BAR:This isn't so much a pool hall, as a bar with pool tables in
it. The decoration is awful. Purple carpeting is surrounded by furniture
constructed from a tough metal compound. The place is in a state of
disrepair.

TOILETS:The toilets here are fairly small and you notice that there are only
male toilets here. The floor is covered in tiles which are mostly chipped or
worn away and bare piping runs overhead.

opposite the door. Behind it sits the owner of this bar who beams at you
from behind a large cigar. There is a haze of cigar smoke in the room.
