 version 1.1 (10.05.2020) done by JOTD:
 - fixed some self-modifying code in the damn sound routine. This code
   works on CPU/emulator configuration without "more compatible", but fails
   on any amiga with a CPU > 68010. This game wins the award of worst
   compatibility coding (issue #0004606). This is because of crappy
   sound replay routines, duplicated in the menu and in the game, grrrrr.
 - fixed in-game sound replay that I had forgotten
 - added quitkey for 68000
 
 version 1.0 (04.05.2020) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - access fault fixed in menu
 - blitter DMA re-enabled (not enabled by default, game was relying
   on the state of the machine when booting)
 - menu music player fixed
 - disk protection removed
 - system friendly imager for MFM disk using RawDIC

Well the imager and unfinished slave has been sitting on my harddrive since 2006,
not working at all either on WinUAE or real amiga with nasty lockups.

On 04/05/2020, deciding it was a waste to let it rot like this after having
successfully ripped the MFM disk and started the game, I decided to work
on it again, and I found the remaining blitter issue and access fault
in one hour and the game is playable... (well that was before I found out about
the register save issues...)
Maybe I learned a trick or two in the meantime :)
