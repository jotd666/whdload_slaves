 This install applies to "Days of Thunder" © 1990 Mindscape.

 Requirements:
 -------------
 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed game requires 0.5 MB ChipMem (+0.5 MB OtherMem for preload).
 It can be quit by pressing Del (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").



 Features:
 ---------
 - Full load from HD
 - Stack frame errors fixed (x3)
 - Keyboard handling fixed
 - Interrupts fixed
 - NewIcon/RomIcon (created by JHZ)
 - Source code included as usual
 - Quit option that works on 68000 machines (default key is 'Del')


 Here's the new and updated patch for this rather craptastic game. I couldn't
 be bothered to spend more time than necessary on it so no trainers or any
 other special features this time. I doubt anyone will seriously play
 this game anyway.

 The old patch crashed in the introduction part, this has been fixed.
 The crashes were caused by not properly emulated exceptions, these
 exceptions were caused by "great" code in the vector routines, instead
 of doing it properly, coder just used chk/trap/div0 exceptions to
 catch certain errors. It's one of the worst and slowest vector routines
 I've ever seen in a game. No more comments needed, really!


 There also were some disk accesses in the old patch and some other
 problems, these have all been fixed now!


 "Enjoy" the game from HD.
