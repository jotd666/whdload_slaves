 This install applies to "Defender Of The Crown 2" CDTV/CD³², 
 1 CD-ROM © 1993 Commodore

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.2 (12.12.2020) done by JOTD:
 - removed 68020 restriction (issue #0004894) by using kickstart 1.3
   instead of kickstart 3.1 (it seems to work fine actually)
 - adapted to whdload v17 (splash screen options)
 
 version 1.1 (12.11.2010) done by JOTD:
 - fixes issues #001989,#001633,#000504,#000525
 - now it is possible to go raiding (no auto-lose)
 - added the working libraries (debox/playerprefs) to the install package
   (some versions of the playerprefs library do not work properly for joymouse feature)

 version 1.0 (20.07.2003) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - loads of icons included
 - source included
 - smart install script with language detection and
   optional language selection. Possibility to update the install to
   change language once installed.

Notes:

I don't think a proper crack ever existed for this game, and that was tricky:
the "go raiding" sequence cannot be completed if there's no CD audio playing:
the CD track is also used as a timer: once it's over, you lose by timeout.
In this version, the time is infinite (I just could not emulate the timer feature
easily, I think you'll forgive me).
