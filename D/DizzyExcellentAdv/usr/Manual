 A limited time edition extremaly rare Dizzy game. Battle the Rockwart the
 Troll, meet Pogie the Fluffie, avoid Shamus the Leprechaun, summon King
 Arthur from his Crusade and wake Daisy from her hundred year snooze!

 Grand Dizzy was feeling very down one day, so Dizzy and Daisy decided to
 cheer him up by baking him his favourite food, cherry pie! So of went Daisy
 to get some cheeries from the cupboard and there were none to be seen!

 "Pogie pinched the cheeries!" she cries, as she saw Pogies pawprint in the
  cupboard, "That darned fluffle. Come here you!" and Pogie promptly darted
  of into the enchanted forest to escape Daises rage.

 Dizzy and Daisy decided to go into the forest to catch Pogie and gather
 some more cheeries at the same time. Whilst seaching for Pogie they got 
 lost and found a castle, where they thought they would find help, but it
 seemed deserted. They looked in the castle for pogie, but Daisy caught
 herself on a mystic spinning wheel. She started feeling really sleepy, so
 she found a bed and went to sleep.
 
 "Wake up Daisy, wake up!" shoued Dizzy. But before he could wake her up,
 Rockwart the troll caught him and locked him up under groud.

 PANIC DIZZY

 Dizzy in his FANTASIC TOY FACTORY! Fit MAGIC SHAPES into GRAND DIZZY's
 INVENTION to make NEW and EXITING TOYS! Panic Stations, Conveyor Belts,
 Bacuum Tubes and more! AMAZINGLY ADDICTIVE! Keep a kewl head...
 DONT PANIC DIZZY!

 One day, Grand Dizzy was putting his finishing touches to his brand new
 TOY MAKING INVENTION.

 "Just got to tighten this last nut and we're ready... oooOOOh... eekk!"
 shouted GRAND DIZZY as the spanner slipped and he fell to the floor.

 "UURGH!!", moaned GRAND DIZZY, "I've got a CRACKING EGGACHE, now I'll never
  finish testing me new TOY MAKING MACHINE. What shall I do??"

 "Don't worry!", replied DIZZY, "We'll help you!"

 So DIZZY, DAISY, DENZIL, DYLAN, DOZY and DORA helped GRAND DIZZY to the
 machine and manned their STATIONS.

 Whilst DIZZY grabbed the CONVEYOR BELT CONTROLLER, the others went
 upstairs and threw MAGIC SHAPES down the tubes.

 Click, Crunch... Cough, Splatt!/FLT (hahaha) ,the machine kicked into
 ACTION!

 "ooooOOh, SLOW down...! Hang on...! Too fast...!", cried DIZZY, but the
 others couldn't HEAR HIM. The TOY MAKING INVENTION just kept getting
 FASTER...

 THE GAME

 Like all of Grand Dizzy's inventins, the magic toy making machine doesn't
 quite work as well as it should. All of it's cogs and wheels constantly
 need fueling with the special magic shapes. The Chutes from which the
 shapes emerge continually descend, when they reach the shape guard at the
 bottom of the screen the toy machine will seize up. The only way to keep
 the chutes from reaching the bottom is to fit lots of shapes through the
 guard and into the machine.

 CONTROLS
 Press FIRE to start game

 LEFT              Q                JOYSTICK LEFT
 RIGHT             W                JOYSTICK RIGHT
 FIRE/DROP SHAPE   ENTER or SPACE   JOYSTICK FIRE

 Press H to PAUSE Game or ESC to QUIT

 THE AIMS OF THE GAME

 Line up the SHAPES GUARD with as MANY MAGIC SHAPES as possible.

 Press FIRE to release all MATCHING SHAPES.

 With 4 OR MORE matching shapes at once, a TOY is created, SO WAIT OR THE
 MAXIMUM TOYS!!

 If the WRONG SHAPE reaches the bottom the CHUTES will decend.

 The chutes will slowly decend and the only way to get them back up is to
 drop several shapes together. The more shapes you get the higher they'll
 go. If the CHUTE reaches the bottom the machine will STOP!

 Keep the machine going as long as possible to make lots of toys.

 Good luck and the best tip of all... DON'T PANIC DIZZY!

 KWIK SNAX

 Dizzy to the rescue! Outwit Zak's court jesters, bumble bees, clockwork
 mice and more in the Land of Persoanality. Mega features and fantastic
 fun in the incredibly playable action packed arcade puzzle game!

 Dizzy and the Yolkfolk band had just finished theier gruelling tour of
 Yolkland and they were all ready for a holiday. Unfortunately counldn't
 decide were to go and a huge argument began to rage. I say unfortunately
 beacuse it woke Zak's the evil wizrd. He got into a huge temper and cast
 a spell left right and centre...

 Denzil thought he was kewl so he was sent to Iceland.

 Dylan always had his head in the clouds and was banished to Cloudland.

 Grand Dizzy was getting a bit old now so he sent to Cukooland!

 Daisy was trapped into Zak's dark dungeon.

 Dizzy went wild he had to get the yolkfolk back together he had forgotten
 to tell them about the a farewell gig he had planned down at the local club!!

 THE GAME

 The game is devided into four levels, each more devastating than the last.
 Point Dizzy's glove to the required destination and press fire.

 Weave around the stationary blocks and push the sliding ones into the
 approaching henchmen to get all the fruit. Complete five levels and free
 a friend!

 There are special features which float down to help, but sometimes they
 will hinder. A special bonus score is awarded if you can get the fruit in the
 flashing order.

 After every level there is a special slippery slidy bonus section. When
 Dizzy starts in a direction he is unable to stop until he hits something -
 it's that slippery. Plan your moves well - there aren't any henchmen but
 you are against the clock.

 the evil Captain Blackheart.

 "Yikes!" yelled Dizzy as Blackheart snatched the pearls from his clutches!

 Blackheart hollered, "Avast there! Splice the mainbrace! And chuck this land
 lubber over the side! With that, Dizzy was made to walk the plank and - 
 splooosh! - into the ocean he fell!

 As Dizzy ank into the mysterious ocean caverns there was only one thing
 for it - head for the suurface and FAST!!

 DIZZY GETS FIZZICAL!

 floor of the deep caverns. Leap on top of a bubble, stay balanced and
