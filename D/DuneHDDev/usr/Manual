certain percentage of it otherwise the emperor will send his terrible
troops: the SARDAUKARS.

  The Fremens will work for you only if they are motivated. If the 
motivation goes down, the same will happen the spice production.
             
                              The Equipment

  The Shai-Hulud, enorm worm living around the spice is extremly
dangerous. He will attack without any procation. He is a constant
threat for the spice production. He has an important role in the
game particulary when you will know how to control them.

it to fight against the Harkonnens. Their training is quite important
