*********************** Thanks Clems M for original disks ********************

The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts"
and must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from an
A500 with tools like "GrabKick" or similar which can be found on Aminet.
If the image is the wrong version or altered in any way, WHDLoad will
quit with an appropriate error message. 

Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
"util/boot/skick346.lha" on Aminet.

Greetings to Jean-François Fabre and Wepl for the superb Kickstart 1.3
plugin and Dos support, Chris, Carlo, Frank, Wild West, all Action members,
my testing crew and the entire WHDLoad team!
