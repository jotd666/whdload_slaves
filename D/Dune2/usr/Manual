                       	      Complete Manual



		Dear Reverend Mother Marius Alethea Blasco:

The situation on Arraskis is critical. I have collected the information
that you requested and strongly urge you to make a decision soon on this
matter.

Frederick's political gamble has proved dangerous. Desperate for spice, he
has challenged the three great Houses to compete for mining rights. The
possession and Governorship of Arrakis has been offered as incentive for
the House that delivers the most spice.

We have considerable self-interest in this war. Arrakis is the only known
source of the spice, and it cannot be manufactured. We must make certain
that whichever of the competing Houses prevails, our supply to the Gesserit
remains continuous. We cannot afford to make enemies now.

I hope this report is useful to you. Please let me know if there is
additional information that you require.

Your Servant,

Lady Elara Moray Trieu



                        ======= THE EMPEROR =======
                        
The Emperor Frederick IV

   We should be wary of this man's true intentions. Removed from the throne
by his brother during the Years of Treason, Frederick eventually overthrew
his brother and again assumed the throne. In this effort he has incurred a
vast debt and now owes considerable sums of spice to his debtors. It is
rumored that he owes CHOAM, the Intergalactic Merchants Guild, over three
billion K units.

   Although still in possession of several significant holdings, his
biggest asset is the small dusty planet Arrakis. As you know, Arrakis is
valuable because it is the only source of Melange in the universe, and all
attempts to replicate it have failed. The Emperor is extremely anxious to
harvest the spice quickly and repay his debts.

   To encourage rapid spice harvesting, Frederick has offered a unique
opportunity to the House that delivers the most spice: sole governorship of
the planet Arrakis and a share of the tax revenues. He has made this offer
to the three great Houses: House Atreides, House Ordos, and House
Harkonnen, and granted them special concession to mine the spice.

   Deputations from all three Houses have now arrived on Arrakis, and we
expect harvesting operations to commence soon. Our spies are in place, and
we have reason to believe that the Emperor may have certain favorites in
this competition. We will advise you as more information becomes available.




                   ======= BACKGROUND ON ARRAKIS =======
                   
                    Planet Arrakis, also known as Dune
                    
Terrain:

The planet surface is covered by endless dunes. There is no vegetation, and
no terrestrial source of water has been found. Miles of barren deserts hold
nothing more than basins, dunes, and occassional rocky outcroppings. The
dangerous sands shift constantly and unpredictably. Shalves and mountain
ranges rising through the dunes provide the only possible building sites on
the planet.

Weather:

Nearly uninhabitable, Dune is extremely hot and oppressively arid.
Windstorms with speeds exceeding 200 km/hr rake the planet surface, and
generate violent electrical storms. Clouds of noxious gases accumulate in
lower areas. Ultraviolet reflections will eventually blind the unprotected
eye. Maintenance of vehicles and structures is extremely difficult under
these conditions.




Indigenous Life-forms:

Two known species represent the native life-forms of Dune: Fremen and Sand
Worms. Legends suggest the Fremen are descended from survivors of an
ancient interstellar shipwreck. Although reclusive and secretive, the
Fremen and quite numerous. The mystery of their survival in these hostile
conditions is eloquent tribute to the nurturing effect of Melange.

The Sand Worms travel easily beneath the surface of the sand. A possible
component of the Melange complex, these hideous creatures have gained a
justified reputation for attacking anything that moves on the surface, and
will devour either humans or their vehicles when the opportunity arises.


                           ======= SPICE =======
                           
Often called Melange, Spice serves many purpose. It makes interstellar
travel possible by allowing Guild Navigators to warp the fabric of space.
Spice can also prolong human life. Those who consume Spice regularly can
live for hundreds of years. The widespread use of spice as a component of
dermal unguents has also maintained the youthful appearance of millions of
consumers.

Spice is a rare and valuable commodity. It is used in trade, barter, and
monetary systems throught the universe. We, the Bene Gesserit know the
spiritual value of Spice, for without it, our Reverend Mothers could not
achieve their visions.

We must watch Arrakis closely, to insure our flow of Spice is not
interrupted!




                          ======= TERRAIN =======
                          
SPICE FIELD

Spice generally occurs along the surface and is a reddish-orange color
which distinguishes it from normal sand.


SAND

Sand is the most common type of terrain found on Arrakis. Most vehicles on
Dune are specially designed to travel upon this terrain. Sand Worms are a
danger when travelling across sand areas.


DUNES

Extensive sand dunes are formed by the constant windstorms. They are
difficult to traverse, especially for ground based units.


ROCK

Rock formations are the only terrain features that provide acceptable
building sites. Sand Worms avoid and will not cross rock formations.


MOUNTAIN

The rugged mountains are formed by layers of rock and give the otherwise
flat planet surface its only notable elevations. Mountains are impassible
to all vehicles but may be crossed by infantry units.





                      ======= HOUSE ATREIDES =======
                      
Planet Information:

Caladan, home planet of the Atreides, has a warm, calm climate and the
lands are lush and green. The rich soils and mild weather support an
extensive variety of agricultural activities. In recent centuries
industrial and technological development has added to the prosperity of the
Caladanian peoples.

House Profile:

House Atreides has been prominent for thousands of years and has a long
tradition of being fair and just administrators. Their people are loyal,
hard working and peaceable. Both intelligent and noble, the Atreides
leaders have endeared themselves to their subjects. Unusual devotion to
duty is a common feature among the Atreides soldiers. According to all
recent reports, the Atreides military is in top operating condition, as are
their vehicles and structures.

Our sources indicate that the Atreides campaign on Dune is being advised by
the brilliant Mentat, Cyril. As expected, the Atreides have been passive
and have not attacked the other Houses to date, although they have
successfully defended themselves against a series of raids, sabotage, and
larger offensives. True to their nature, the Atreides have attempted to
achieve their goals through diplomacy, a strategy which will undoubtably
fail on Dune.





                        ======= HOUSE ORDOS =======
                        
Planet Information:

The home planet of the Ordos is a frigid and ice-covered world. We presume
the Ordos import their agricultral and technological goods from nearby star
systems. Acting as traders and brokers, the Ordos produce no physical
product of their own and rely upon their merchandising skills to survive.

House Profile:

Our sources indicate the House Ordos represents a cartel of wealthy
families, brought together by the desire for greater security. The ordos
have little conscience and seem to gain strength through their sabotage and
terrorism. Protected by their great wealth, the Ordos' status as a great
House is unaffected by their long history of manipulation, trickery, and
deception.

Recent reports suggest the cunning Mentat, Ammon, is in charge of Ordos'
Dune operations. This is a rare opportunity to get a clear view of Ammon in
action. It will be interesting to learn more about these clandestine
peoples.




                      ======= HOUSE HARKONNEN =======
                      
Planet Information:

From the dark world of Giedi Prime the terrible House Harkonnen has spread
across the universe. A cruel people, we can expect the Harkonnen to be
ruthless towards both friend and foe in their pursuit of control of Dune.

House Profile:

House Harkonnen is the most savage House in the universe. The Harkonnens
have a long history of employing violence and fear to achieve their
objectives. Status is not bestowed in House Harkonnen, it is taken. If a
subordinate kills a superior, he assumes that position and is respected.
Their military organization changes constantly and is almost impossible to
follow.

Our current reports on House Harkonnen indicate their Dune strategies are
being dictated by the unstable Mentat, Radnor. A true Harkonnen, Radnor
reached his position by assassinating the previous Mentat Marko, his former
teacher and guide. We do not know the extent to which Radnor is trusted by
his people or the House he serves. The Harkonnens on Dune have spent most
of their efforts assembling a considerable military force. We doubt they
plan to actually harvest spice for the Emperor. They seem convinced that
they can merely conquer the other Houses. The combination of Radnor's lust
for power and his ability to persuade is dangerous. We shall continue to
monitor the Harkonnens closely, for they are quite unpredictable.

     This window shows detailed information on any structure or unit
     clicked on in the tactical window. For example, if you want information
     about your Construction Yard, click on it with the mouse, and a
     blinking white box will appear around the Construction Yard. The
     Command Window in the middle right hand side will show you the
     Construction Yard, its damage, and any options available. if you click
     on another House's unit or structure controlled by the computer, only
     the title picture, and strength of that unit or structure will be
     displayed.
     
Radar Window:
     Located in the lower right hand corner of the screen, this window
     allows you to see things on a larger scale. It will display your
     current structures as colored squares on a black background. When you
     build an Outpost (available in Scenario 2), you will get a more
     detailed map, showing sand and rock formations as they are explored.
     
     
Mentat Button:
     Clicking on the Mentat button will take you to the Mentat Screen. A
     lost of topics and information will be displayed.
     
Options Button:
     This button brings up the Game Options Menu. This menu lists the
     following options:
                                Load a game
                                Save this game

                                Pick another house
                                Quite playing
                                Continue game
                                
                                


GETTING STARTED:

At the center of the Tactical Window, your Construction Yard will be
highlighted. You will also notice several military units surrounding your
base. Note that the color of your military units corresponds with the
original hearld color you saw when you first chose your House. The
Construction Yard's commands will be located in the Command Window, found
in the middle right side of the screen.

To build a concrete slab click on BUILD IT, or type "B." The Construction
Yard will produce a concrete slab. Notice the percentage of completion as
the Construction Yard works towards finishing it. Once complete, the
message, "PLACE IT" will appear on the button. To place the concrete slab,
click on a portion of rock adjacent to the Construction Yard and the slab
will appear on the map. You will now be ready to build another structure.
If you wish to see a list of other structures you are capable of building,
click on the Construction Yard picture or type "F3" in the Command Window.
This will take you to the Production Screen.




EXPLORATION:

Initially the areas around yoru base and units are shrouded in darkness,
only a small portion of terrain will be visible to you in the Tactical
Window. these visible portions are caused by the sight range of your units.
If you send units into the dark areas, the terrain will become revealed to
you. Uncovering new terrain is beneficial and sometimes dangerous. It is
beneficial because you need to search for spice fields to harvest, and
dangerous because you may run into an enemy squadron, or even a Sand Worm.
Beware! just because you can't see an enemy unit doesn't mean he can't see
you!


MAP MOVEMENT:

To move around your world you can use the Radar Window or the Tactical
Window. The Radar Window movement occurs as you move around the Tactical
Window or with your mouse. To move with your mouse click on the white box
while continuing to hold down the left mouse button and move it around the
window to the desired location.

To move around the Tactical Window using the mouse place the mouse cursor
to one of the four edges of the Tactical Window, with the Auto Scroll
option ON it will automatically scroll in the direction of the cusror
arrow. With the Auto Scroll option OFF hold down the left mouse button to
scroll the window. To use your keyboard to move around the Tactical Window
use your numeric keypad arrows or your arrow keys.




HOW TO BUILD STRUCTURES:

Before you begin building structures, here is an explantion of the various
elements of production in the Command Window.

Name:
      This is the name of the Structure.
      
Picture Button:
      Click on the Picture button or type "F3" to enter the Production
      Screen.

Damage Indicator:
      This indicator displays the amount of damage the structure has taken.
      If the bar graph is: Green = little to no damage, Yellow = moderate
      damage, Red = heavy damage. When a structure is damaged its operating
      capacity decreases.

Repair Button:
      This button only appears if the structure is damaged. To repair a
      structure, click on the Repair button or type "R." Repairs will begin
      immediately, but all production will be put on hold. Repairing a
      structure does cost credits, the cost varies from structure to
      structure. If a structure can be upgraded the Upgrade button will then
      appear.
      
Production Button:
      This button shows what you are currently producing or the last item
      you produced.

Foundation Indicator:
      This indicator is found on the right side of the Production button,
      and displays the shape and amount of concrete needed to have a stable
      foundation for the structure displayed. For concrete it indicates its
      size.
      
      


To build structures on dune you will need a Construction Yard. First,
select the Construction Yard in the Tactical window by clicking on the
structure or by typing "F3." If the picture of the structure that you wish
to build is displayed on the Production button in the Command Window, then
click on the "Build It" message or type "B." That structure will now begin
production and the "Build It" message will be replaced by the percentage of
completion. If the structure displayed is not what you wish to build, then
click on the Picture button to enter the Production screen. (The Production
screen will be described later in the manual.)

If at any time you wish to stop production of that structure, click on the
production button and the percentage of completion will be replaced by the
message "On Hold." To return to production, click on the Production button
again and the percentage of completion will return.

Once the structure is done the message "Construction is complete" will be
seen. The message on the Production button has now changed to a flashing
"Place It." To place the structure, click on the Production button ot type
"P." Your cursor will now turn into a glowing rectangle in the shape of
your completed structure. Move the cursor over a portion of rock or
concrete foundation adjacent to any of your structures and click the left
mouse button or press the space bar. The new structure will now be
displayed on the map in the Tactical Window. In the event that you do not
wish to place the completed structure you may revert your building back to
the "Place It" state.

Hint: Structures can only be placed on Rock or Concrete. All structures
must also be adjacent to another structure.

Hint: The "Place It" cursor will change colors according to the terrain it
is over: White, Yellow, or Red with an "X" through the cursor. A White
cursor means that there is sufficient concrete to place the structure. a
Yellow cursor means that there is insufficient concrete to place the
structure and the structure will require repairs. A Red cursor means that
you cannot place the structure at that location.




How TO BUILD UNITS:

To build units on Dune you will need a production facility such as: Light
Factory or Barracks. The production of units is done in the same manner as
structures, with the only exception being the placing of the units. The
units are automatically placed beside the production facility when
completed. If the area around the production facility is occupied, a
Carryall will pick up the completed unit and place it nearby. A message
will inform you that a unit has been deployed. Those newly deployed units
are now ready for orders.


PRODUCTION SCREEN:

You can produce units or structures at any time, provided that you have
enough credits and a production facility. A production facility is a
structure that can manufacture structures and armament. For example, the
Construction Yard produces structures while the Light Factory produces
Trikes and Quads. To see what a production facility is capable of
producing, click on a production facility in the Tactical Window, then
click on it's Picture button in the Command Window. This will take you into
the Production Screen.

HELPFUL HINTS:

   Targeting:
      What can you target to attack? When selecting the command "Attack"
      you are capable of attacking units, structures, or terrain. This
      includes friendly units and structures as well.
      
   Mounds:
      What is under those big mounds in the sand? A number of surprises can
      be found under those mounds in the sand. Some of the items that can
      be found are: Spice blooms, hidden credits, abandoned vehicles,
      hiding enemy units, etc.
      
      How do you find out what is under the mound? You can move a unit over
      the top of the mound or shoot the mound. If you choose to move a unit
      over the mound and a Spice bloom is under it, your unit will be
      destroyed, and fresh Spice will appear on the surface. If you decide
      to shoot a mound and there are credits under it, those credits will
      no longer exist. So youw ill have to decide which approach you wish
      to employ when discovering what is under a mound.
      
      


   Creating Teams:
      How can you create teams of units? First, select one of your units
      and give it the "Move" command. When it asks for the destination,
      select another one of your units. The first unit will move up right
      beside the second unit and wait. Now, select the second unit and
      give it the "Move" command and pick a spot on the map. The first unit
      will now follow the second unit until it is given another command. In
      this way you may direct them as a team.
      
   Capturing Enemy structures:
      How do you go about capturing an enemy structure? First, the ability
      to capture an enemy structure is only given to Infantry and Troopers.
      Second, the enemy structure's Damage Indicator must be in the RED.
      you can then command an Infantry/Trooper unit to "Move" onto the
      structure and take it over. If you command an Infantry/Trooper unit
      to move onto the structure before it is in the RED, your unit will
      explode and inflict damage on the structure.
      
      What happens when you capture a structure? When a structure is
      captured by one of your units, it will become one of your structures.
      If you capture an enemy factory, you will be able to produce any
      units that factory was producing when it was under enemy control.
      This tactic will allow you to get possession of special enemy weapons
      that your House cannot produce.
      
      Certain structures such as Palaces, Outposts, Barracks, IX, and Wor
      Facilities can never be captured. These structures must be destroyed.
      Beware, for some Houses bobby-trap their own structures in case they
      fall into enemy hands. These structures may self-destruct right
      away or they might wait awhile.
      
   Sand Worms:
      What can you do about Sand Worms eating your units? Sand Worms will 
      eat anything on the sand, so try to have your units move on rock as
      much as possible. You can also attack a Sand Worm by trageting the
      distortion in the sand, and if you hurt it enough it will go away.
      
   Number of Commandable Units:
      Why do I sometimes get the message "Not able to build at this time"
      on the Image Window in my Production Screens? There is a limited
      number of units that you can effectively command at one time. You
      will not be able to produce any more units until some of your
      existing units are destroyed. You may wish to attack or destroy some
      of your own units to allow for production of new units.
