 This install applies to "Driller" © 1988 Incentive Software/Domark - 1 disk

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

 version 2.2 (07.08.2022) done by JOTD:
 - fixed bug while adding quitkey for one version (issue #0005761)
 
 version 2.1 (02.08.2022) done by JOTD:
 - added quitkey on 68000
 
 version 2.0 (01.08.2022) done by JOTD:
 - support for fast memory for great speed and 512k chip only
 - speed regulation added (game is too fast with fastmem!)
 - adapted for WHDLoad v17
 - nice icons included
 - source code included
 - readme file rewritten

 version 1.0 (21-Apr-2002) done by Codetapper:
 - Supports 3 versions
 - Full load from HD
 - Loads and saves games to HD
 - Copy protection removed (MFM track/manual protection/encryption)
 - Empty DBF loop fixed
 - 4 Colour Icon, MagicWB Icon, RomIcon, NewIcon, OS3.5 Colour Icon (created by 
   me!) and 2 Exoticons (taken from http://exotica.fix.no)
 - Quit option (default key is 'PrtSc' on the numeric keypad)

The unusual amount of chip memory required for this game is due to the fact
that 2 of the 3 supported versions contain an extra file called "title.seq"
which is an animated rotating Incentive logo. If anyone is desperate to have
a version without the intro and which only requires 512k chip memory, 
contact me and I'll make a special version.

Note from JOTD: now uses fastmem so 512k chipmem is enough.
