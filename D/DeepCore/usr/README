notes from JOTD:

game is highy buggy and still crashes or has glitches from time to time
I'm not sure if it's fully playable, but enjoy what you can. Clearly
they wanted to remake Gods in a nuclear plant or whatever: same jump, same
muscles, same graphics (to some extent) same shield-like bonuses, bouncing
sound for bonuses... Except that Gods is way better and less buggy too.
