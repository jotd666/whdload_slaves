underwater nuclear research base, located 20.000 feet deep.

[1mCommander Lipton:[0m
"We have now lost all radio contact with the staff in
the research base and I am afraid that the last thing we heard from them
was something about aliens turning the defence system against them.. I'm
not sure what really has happened down there but the oxygen seems to be
running out!

[1mDawnrazor:[0m
"And what do you expect from me?"

[1mCommander Lipton:[0m
"You know me Dawnrazor. I won't leave you alone until
you accept this one and besides you owe me one! We simply don't have
anybody else in the force with your experience and ..."
