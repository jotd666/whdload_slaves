 This install applies to "Deliverance" Â© 1993 21st Century Entertainment

 This install requires WHDLoad and The Patcher to be in the path. Both can be
 found in the WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 There's an alternate lo-spec .slave file which requires only 0.5 MB ChipMem
 and 1.0 MB 24-bit other mem.
 
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.0 (19.04.2020) done by JOTD:
 - added in-game trainer keys (1-6 to select section, HELP or CD32 fwd+yellow to skip level)
 - blue/second button disabled on flying level (use up!)
 - added another trainer (infinite energy)
 - added alternate slave for 512k chip only. Doesn't work with 32-bit fast memory, but on a
   machine with 24-bit expansion memory and 512k chipmem it will work.
 - more compatible controller read
 
 version 1.5 (26.05.2019) done by JOTD:
 - adapted to whdload v17
 - removed F9 key to enable trainer. Now done in startup menu / CUSTOM1=1
 - joypad support for pause/ESC
 - CUSTOM2=1 makes blue/2nd button act like UP.
   It's not perfect (pressing the button makes the character climb the ladder, also UP still jumps)
   but that's too much work to improve the controls further given the way the game is coded
   
 version 1.4 (08.05.2014)
 - fixed keyboard even more (rewritten all keyboard handling): issue #003010
 
 version 1.3 (30.04.2014)
 - fixed keyboard (most visible in highscore section): issue #002565

 version 1.2 (09.10.2006)
 - RawDIC imager (Patcher imager was defective)

 version 1.1 (06.10.2006) done by JOTD
 - fixed TRAP #2 exception with later versions of WHDLoad
 - rewritten install script & readme
 - added nice icons
 - added manual
 - source code included

 version 1.0 (09.07.1998) done by Harry
 - initial release
 - sound fixed
 - quit key
 - F9: toggles infinite lives

 Notes:
 
 - There's a cheat (fly mode) mentionned: [Right Amiga] + [Right Alt] + [Right Shift] + [Backspace] but
   it doesn't work, and no trace of the code activating it has been found in the game
 - Level skip doesn't work on last level (flying level) else it crashes the game
 - In inferno boss stage, jumping on the rotating hands triggers a nasty palette/instant game over
   bug. Conclusion: do not do that.
 - there's no end sequence like *at all*. On completing the last level, the highscore entry appears...
   That's cheap! When I think I had bought the original at the time...
