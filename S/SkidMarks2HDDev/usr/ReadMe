 This install applies to "SkidMarks 2 / Super Skidmarks" © 1995 Acid Software

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 8.0 MB OtherMem
 (low fast memory slave available as well).
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 The game requires an installed A600, A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp. "kick40068.A4000", or "kick40063.A600"). The image can be extracted from a A1200 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200/A4000.RTB" or "kick40063.A600.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.1 (22.11.2020) done by JOTD:
 - low memory slave fixed (more memory) to avoid crash (issue #0004865)
 - support for other CD version: Ultimate Super Skidmarks (issue #0004868)
 
 version 2.0 (20.11.2020) done by JOTD:
 - low memory slave re-provided (issue #0004220, default: 8MB RAM allowing all different cars)
 - 7 disk version supported (at least, issue #0004781)
 - note: police.aga and police.set are missing from floppy but can be copied from a CD32 version
 - game doesn't seem to require a 68020, so should run with a A600 3.1 image on a 68000
 
 version 1.1 (27.02.2018) done by JOTD:
 - fixed crash on exit (issue #0001540)
 - increased memory to 8MB to allow more cars for multi-player (issue #0001539)
   (left old low memory slave in the archive, install manually)
 
 version 1.0 (10.10.2006) done by JOTD:
 - initial release, CD³² only
 - VBR access removed
 - source code included

Note: if you get crashes at startup (issue #0002504) just try NOCACHE

The "Ultimate Superskidmarks" CD edition is just the CD32 version copied
over and over with other "skins" and cars. This CD is rather a waste of space...
My installer doesn't install all the games, it just lets you choose between the various
flavours and just installs one of them. The game is 100% identical to the CD32 version

Supported versions:

CD32:OK
SPS1797:OK (v2.2)
2.21 (9 disks): bad dumps
Ultimate CD:OK
