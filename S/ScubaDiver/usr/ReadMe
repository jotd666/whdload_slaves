 This install applies to "Scuba Diver" © 1994 Surreal - 3 disks

 It requires a AGA capable computer
 
 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 Notes:
 
 Wow, keyboard, sound, blitter, interrupts... everything needed fixing there!!
 Such bad programming for an AGA game, this sets some kind of record.
 Besides that, the game has a lot of colors, graphics are okay (I love the sea parallax),
 music is good, menus are nice, and overall very well done. That's a PD game but really
 approaching commercial quality. This is hard as nails too...
 
 Coincidence: I loved Scuba Dive on Oric and will probably publish a remake on Windows using the
 same shitty graphics as the Oric original.
