 This install applies to "Shinobi" © 1989 Sega.

 This installer requires the original Shinobi disk. It supports the versions from
 SEGA's 'Arcade Smash Hits' and 'Super SEGA' compilation.

 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 notes:

 - graphics of this game suck. I bet C64 version was better.
 - music of this game suck (not even in tune)
 - this game does not work properly with WinUAE (too much SMC and CPU dependent
   loops). Maybe I'll fix it, but when you've got WinUAE, you've got MAME and
   shinobi is a hundred times better on MAME


 Just for fun, some text found in the game:


Fuck me! I never thought you would do it!! Bet it took a long time though!



By the way, the only way to crack this game is if you have at least 4mb of
fast ram... There's a hint!  Are you enjoying this, by the way?

Me (Richard Aplin) and Tim (the programmer) thought we might give you a
little challange... I reckon I'll hold you off for about a week.  Oh, by
the way Quartex, you told me at the SAE party this would be EASY..
Well is it?



Well, obviously you weren't fooled earlier!! I'm impressed! Not a bad bit
of hacking.. but the best is yet to come!!! Hehehehe... Just wait, cos now
it gets REALLY good..
