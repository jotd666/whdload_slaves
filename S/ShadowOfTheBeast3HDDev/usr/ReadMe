Notes for 2.1 (JOTD):

Finally got rid of joypad related glitches. Thanks to other experiences in amiga game development, I figured
out that joypad read was done too soon and perturbated the original game screen sync, resulting in
some horrible glitches in some parts. Moving that joypad read later in the sequence fixed the bugs

Notes for 1.7 (JOTD):

Here is the new control option: the controls are soooo much better with a dedicated jump button.
Note that using jump when you're facing a ladder just makes the character cling to the ladder
In some other games adaptations (Gods, Ghost'n'Goblins), I could make the character jump instead,
but here the game logic is made so if you're jumping and pass in front of a ladder you cling to
it automatically so it's by design (exactly like in Cedric or Moktar/Titus). The only thing
that needed some thinking is the fact that you can go up a ladder with "up", and also you
can start climbing a ladder with "up", whereas "up" has no effect on jump.

A funny thing was: if I didn't distinguish between demo and real play mode, the character doesn't jump
in the demo (because it's receiving a "up" order) so it misses the trajectory, continues right and falls
and ... locks up the machine :)

The infinite lives trainer is different from the invincibility trainer because
you have to actually be careful of not being hit too much. But I didn't fix the
energy refill, so when you lose a life, you don't know the energy status. This status
isn't supposed to refill during game so it would require some more reverse engineering...

Notes for 1.5 (StingRay):
I had a look at the Beast 3 patch because of a report that the music runs
too slow, this was not a problem with the patch but just running the
NTSC version of the game on a PAL machine. You need to use WHDLoad's
"NTSC" option to make the music play at proper speed in that case.

However, there were quite a few real problems with the old patch, the most
serious one was the not fully supported intro for the PAL version, it would
just freeze after a while. This was caused by a buggy loader patch which only
worked by coincidence for the NTSC version! I have completely recoded the
loader for the intro data and now, 15 years after support for the PAL
version was added, the intro now finally works properly! I have also disabled
the "Insert Game Disk 1" screen that was shown after the intro and added
an option to skip the intro with CUSTOM2.

There also were Bplcon0 fixes needed and bytes write to the volume register
in the replayers which I have fixed as well. I have also optimised the
ByteKiller decruncher and added an error so in case the loaded data is
corrupt WHDLoad will quit with an appropriate error message.

I may update the patch further in the future but for now this should do.
