SUPERCARS II
------------
For  Super Cars II the creators of Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge have taken
the  original features of Supercars and added a vast array of new features
and  choices.   These  have  made  this the best ever overhead racing game
available on home computer.


RACING
------
As  you  begin  each  season,  you  will have a set amount of money, and a
Supercar.   Throughout the season you will need to re-invest your winnings
to  buy  a better Supercar and weaponry in order to keep your place in the
championship.

In  the  races,  a  player  must  finish in the top five in order to score
points  and  win  money.  If the player fails to finish in the top 5, then
the  player will be disqualified and will be prevented from completing the
season.   During  the races, a player is allowed to use any means at their
disposal,  such  as  missiles, rams, barriers or anything, to advantage to
first  place.   Beware though, you're not the only one with weapons.  Your
position  when you finish a race will determine your starting position for
the  next,  which  will  be  in  reverse order to your finishing position.
Finish  first,  for  example,  and  you  will start the next race in tenth
position,  finish ninth and you will start the next race in second, and so
on.


MAIN OPTION MENU
----------------
On  loading  the  game  the player will be presented with the main options
menu,  on which the following choices will be offered.  Move your joystick
up  and  down to highlight the option you wish to change, and then move it
left and right to change it.  Press 'Fire' to exit.


LEVELS
------
Easy Medium or Hard
There  are  three  levels  of  difficulty, each made up of seven different
tracks.   If  you haven't played the game before we suggest that you start
on  the  easy  level.  On the hard level both tracks and other drivers are
more  dangerous  than  in  the  earlier stages.  When you are for the more
difficult  levels,  choosing them will give you a more powerful and better
armed car to start the level with.

There are three different types of circuit:

1. Snow.
2. Grass.
3. Rocks and heather.

Each  type  of  circuit  will  effect  the  handling  of  your Supercar in
different  ways.  We'll leave it for you to find out just how the handling
is effected.


NUMBER OF PLAYERS
-----------------
There  is a one or two player option.  Choosing the one player option will
present  you with a full screen game, whilst two player will show the game
in split screen mode.

Player One
Under this option there is a line which reads "PLAYER ONE".  To enter your
name  simply  move the pointer over this line and type your name.  This is
followed  by the control method option, which allows you to choose between
pressing   "FIRE  TO  ACCELERATE",  and  "FIRE  TO  BRAKE".   In  fire  to
accelerate, removing your finger from the fire button will act as a brake,
and with the fire button to brake, acceleration is automatic, and pressing
fire  will  brake  the  car.  Try both options to choose the best for you.
The  "FIRE  TO BRAKE" option allows for harder braking, for example, which
you might or might not prefer.

Player Two
This  offers  the  same  options  as  player  one,  with an additional one
offering a choice of joystick or keyboard controls.  The relevent keyboard
keys will be detailed later.

Continue Game
If  you  are  in two player mode, then there is a choice of two methods of
playing  the  game.   In order to progress to the next race, a player must
finish  in  the top five.  In two player mode, you are offered a choice of
both  drivers forward if only one driver finishes in the top five, or just
carrying  forward  the driver that just finished in the top five, and thus
ending the game of the other driver.


JOYSTICK CONTROLS
-----------------
Left:      Turn left.
Right:     Turn right.
Forward:   Activate front weapon.
Backwards: Activate rear weapon.
Fire:      Accelerate or brake, depending on mode.


KEYBOARD CONTROLS
-----------------
The following keys correspond to the appropriate joystick controls:

Z:     Turn left.
X:     Turn right.
Space: Fire.
L:     Forward.
Comma: Backwards.


REPAIRING YOUR SUPERCAR
-----------------------
Following  a race, a section will appear which allows you to repair damage
to your supercar, and load up with fresh missiles and weapons for the next
race.  The first one will allow you to repair your supercar.  If you don't
wish to carry out any repairs, click 'OK' to go to the next screen

On the repair screen you will find a list of repairs available to you.  If
you can afford a repair you want simply move the pointer over it and press
fire.   A  damage  bar  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen will indicate how
effective  the  repair has been.  You can carry out as many repairs as you
can  afford.   Once  you have done all the repairs you want to do click on
'OK'  to move onto the next screen.  In two player mode, both players will
fix  their Supercars in turn before moving onto the next screen, the trade
screen.


THE TRADE SCREEN
----------------
On  this  screen  there are five icons at the bottom, BUY, SELL, OK, FRONT
and  REAR.   There  are  a few rules here.  First you must choose FRONT or
REAR,  which  will decide where there weapon will be on your Supercar, and
what  joystick  move/keypress  will  bring  it into action,.  You are only
allowed two different types of weapons per race, but the only limit on the
number  of  any  particular  type of weapon you buy is the money you have.
Picking  wether  "BUY"  or  "SELL" will put you into the appropriate mode.
Clicking  on  any item will allow you to buy or sell.  You can only buy an
item if you have enough money.  If you are selling missiles then the price
you  are offered will not be as high as the shop selling price.  Prices do
fluctuate  quite  dramatically sometimes, and it is possible with a little
practice  to actually  speculate.  Buying a load of missiles when then are
very  cheap, and then selling them back once their price has increased for
example, will increase the funds available to you.

Counters  will  indicate  the  price,  and how many missiles you currently
have.  The equipment that you will be offered is:

FRONT MISSILES:  Missiles  that  will  shoot  straight out in front of you
                 until  they hit something.  Pretty accurate, but they can
                 be dodged with a little practice.

REAR MISSILES:   As above, but they remove the opposition behind you.

HOMING MISSILES: Very  deadly.   They  will  home in on the nearest car to
                 you, and blast it to pieces.

SUPER MISSILES:  This  one  rotates  round  your  car  Supercar destroying
                 anything that gets close to you.

MINES:           These  are dropped onto the track, and will explode after
                 a  few  seconds,  destroying  anything  that  is in close
                 proximinity.

TURBO BOOST:     This  will  give  your Supercar a massive but short lived
                 turbo  boost.   It  will  allow  you  to  jump over a car
                 infront  of you, or to jump a bridge even if you cant get
                 a run up.

ARMOUR:          Provides  you  with some protection against the rigourous
                 onslaught  from other vehicles.  It is available in three
                 grades, each obviously more effective then the last.

BATTERING RAM:   Again  available  in three levels, this will allow you to
                 damage and destroy other vehicles by smashing into them.

ENGINE TURBO:    This  will  increase  the top speed of your Supercar, and
                 again available in three grades.

Clicking on "OK" will leave this screen.


CONVERSATION SCREENS
--------------------
These  will  appear randomly after a race, featuring the following people:
Department of Transport Inspector, Policeman, Enviromental Health Officer,
Journalist,  Sponser and Solicitor.  In each instance, they will ask you a
question, and you will be offered a choice of three answers.  Choosing the
correct  answer will increase your points or money, or will reduce a fine.
It's up to you to work out which are the correct answers.


CHEAT MODE
----------
Enter  player  one's  name  as  "Wonderland" and player two's name as "The
Seer"  (only  capitalize  the  first  letter  of each word).  You will now
qualify regardless of your position and you'll have all the extras too.
