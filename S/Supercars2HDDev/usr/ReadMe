 Game requires 512kb chip mem (+1.9Mb other memory for preload option)

 This install requires WHDLoad v17 and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

  for weapons with CUSTOM2 bits 0 and 1 for each player (1,2,3))
- added BUTTONWAIT to pause in next race description
- changed to CUSTOM3 for NTSC layout

Version 1.0 (24.08.2005) done by Codetapper:

- Full load from HD
- Loads and save best scores and fastest times (unless you cheat!)
- Both decrunchers relocated to fast memory (huge loading speedup!)
- Manual protection removed (screen will never appear!)
- Disk protection removed
- Blitter wait inserted
- Snoop bug fixed in copperlist setup
- Trainer added: Set CUSTOM1=1 to activate the built in cheat mode
                 Set CUSTOM2=1-7 to start on whichever track you wish
- NTSC screen layout changed: Set CUSTOM3=1 to move the panel up a bit or 
  use the keys +/- to switch the status panel during the game
- Default player names can be preset by using the CUSTOM tooltype and 
  separating the names with a comma. eg. CUSTOM=Codetapper,Wepl
- All intro screens can be bypassed with fire or either mouse button
- RomIcon, NewIcon and 2 OS3.5 Colour Icons (all created by Frank!)
- Quit option (default key is F10)

KEYS:
- F1-F7 to select the track you wish to start on
- F8 to activate the built-in cheat mode on the options screen (see below 
  for full cheat details)
- +/- to move the position of the status panel (useful for NTSC users)

CD32 JOYPAD CONTROLS:
- forward: front weapon
- reverse: rear weapon
- play: pause
- fwd+rev (when paused): quit current game
- fwd+rev+yellow: quit current game

CHEAT MODE:
- Taken from Sweet Cheater by Keith Krellwitz!
- Enter player one's name as "Wonderland" and player two's name as 
  "The Seer" (only capitalize the first letter of each word).  You
  will now qualify regardless of your position and you'll have all
  the extras too.

Frank requested that the game status panel be moved up if you are playing
in NTSC mode due to most of it being cut off.  If you use the NTSC tooltype
you will probably want to set CUSTOM4=1 which will remove the 8 pixel high
black gap and cause part of the panel to disappear so only the vital
information is displayed.  During the game you can also toggle the panel up
and down by pressing the +/- keys.

A big apology to everyone that has been waiting so long for this install.
I've got no excuses other than being very busy.  I hope you'll at least
agree that this is the ultimate version of the game!  Enjoy!

This install is compatible with SPS224.

Greetings to Jean-François Fabre for the original JST install, Frank for
the great icons, Wepl for the mighty WHDLoad, all Action members, my
testing crew and the entire WHDLoad and HOL teams!


Codetapper/Action (24-Aug-2005)
