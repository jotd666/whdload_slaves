The Speris Legacy hints by Kyzer/CSG
Email: kyzer@4u.net

The Speris Legacy is a Zelda-like adventure game written by Binary
Emotions, published by Team 17 software. It's a fun game, but every so
often it gets quite illogical, and gets a lot of people stuck along the
way.

However, I, along with Murray Kendrick (and Team 17 support :) have
finished the game, and I decided to write a solution. Rather than write a
walkthrough, I thought I'd write a set of InvisiClue style hints.

Please try to play the game properly and don't read this guide too much,
you will get much more satisfaction out of the game if you do this!
However, if you do start to get frustrated, wandering around not knowing
what to do, please load this hint file up and read the 'What am I meant to
do here?' hints. The game is linear and will simply let you wander around
with nothing to do until you perform the correct 'next thing'. It doesn't
always hint what the correct 'next thing' is.


--- Level 1: Sharma City -----------------------------------------------------

WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO HERE?
- Well, getting out of bed would be a good start.
- Did you read the introductory story? Where might all the action be?
- At the palace, of course! Talk to the King in the palace.
- So, the King wants you to get rid of Gallus. Should be simple enough!
- ...but perhaps you'll need to get prepared first.
- Have a look around the city, talk to the inhabitants, open the chests,
  and so on. But you'll need some fairly important items before you leave
  the city and go adventuring.
- A sword and shield would, in particular, be very handy.
- Then you could leave Sharma City for the adventure of your life!

MARIA'S PRETTY SEXY, HUH?
- Barefoot and pregnant, I shouldn't wonder!

WHAT'S IN THE BLOCK OF ICE?
- It's an antitoxin potion that you'll need in the Sandoon level later. The
  ice won't melt until you reach Sandoon, so quit waiting!

WHERE CAN I GET A SWORD?
- There's one in a secret room in the palace.
- You can enter this room from a door on the east wall of the palace
  (on the outside). The door is locked, you'll need a key.
- The key is in a chest, in the westmost house of Sharma City.
- Enter the secret room and you'll be set upon by two ghosts. Ignore them,
  and push the golden statue at the back of the room to the left. You'll
  reveal a transporter which will take you to another room.
- Open the chest in this room and you'll receive the sword! You can now
  practise your sword-skills by teleporting back to the room with the
  ghosts.

WHERE CAN I GET A SHIELD?
- There's one in the Royal Maze.
- Its entrance is at the very southmost point of Sharma City.
- There's a path leading into the maze, but it's blocked up.
- "A tip of steel will reveal"
- Don't go on unless you have a sword.
- Slash the blockage in the very centre of the path and you'll reveal the
  maze's entrance.

HELP! I'M LOST IN THE ROYAL MAZE!
- You do know that destroying flowers will reveal useful stuff, don't you?
- If you do that, you should discover transporters and eventually reach the
  centre of the maze, which is barred by spikes.
- If you back-track a little to the nearest flowerbed, there's a
  transporter in there that will take you to a switch. Flip this switch to
  lower the spikes and let you in the centre of the maze.
- Once you've flipped the switch, the only way forward is another
  transporter in the area, which takes you to the start of the maze. Dive
  in again and get the shield from the chest in the centre of the maze.
- Select the shield as your weapon! Your sword still works and you recieve
  extra protection from bad guys.
- Now, with your sword and shield, it's time to leave Sharma City and go
  adventuring!

HOW DO I LEAVE SHARMA CITY?
- The exit is in the north-east corner of the city.
- Your next port of call is Gilliard's Rhine, if you take the footpath
  north, you'll reach the Rhine.


--- Level 2: Gilliard's Rhine ------------------------------------------------

WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO HERE?
- Well, you'll no doubt have seen that there's a troll guarding the
  bridge over the Shimmering Lake, so you'd best solve that problem first.
- You should explore the level (it's very large) and familiarise yourself
  with the location of Phillis's Shop, the House of Mystery, the woods,
  the Maze of Confusion, the Baboon's Butt Inn, Elstrika's house,
  Gilliard's Rhine Church, the Information Building, the Pool of Dreams,
  the cornfields and Goerdaks Fort.
- You should also talk to Rupert, Phillis, Pastor Jobe, Gardic, Zamma,
  Elstrika, Barnabbas, Joshua and Samuel.
- If you do that, you should know that Gardic wants a pipe. Get him one.
- Once you've done that, you should start to smell a strange smell. You have
  to work out what this is and help fix it.
- Once you've done that, Elstrika will be crying. You have to make her happy.
- Once you've done that, Jack will arrive in the Rhine to give you a message.
  Heed it!
- Now you have the key to the exit door of the level.

HOW DO I GET PAST THE TROLL?
- If he's not letting you past, I guess you'll just have to kill him.
- Your sword won't do. Ask Rupert for a dagger. You'll have to collect 10
  coins to pay him, so go on a ghost killing spree until you have enough cash.
- Throw daggers at the troll when he's not facing you. Eventually, he'll die,
  and leave a key to Phillis's Shop.

WHY DON'T MY BOMBS WORK?
- You can't use bombs until you have the tinderbox.
- It's in Elstrika's house.
- Elstrika will let you in her house if you say nice things to her. The
  tinderbox is in one of the chests.

WHERE CAN I GET A RED STRENGTH POTION?
- Just south of the Baboon's Butt Inn, there is an enclosure with 5 chests
  and 1 ghost. The entrance is from the south, use a bomb to enter. The red
  strength potion is in one of the chests.

HOW DO I HELP THE INJURED MAN?
- He needs a medicine that's in a place that's "hard to get to".
- You need the red strength potion.
- Go to the north-east corner of the level, where there is a stone slab.
  Select the red potion as your object in your inventory, and push the slab
  to the left. You'll reveal a transporter. At the other end of the
  transportation are two chests, one of which contains a yellow healing
  potion.
- Take the healing potion back to the injured man and apply it, and you'll
  recieve a fine gem for your trouble.

HOW DO I GET A PIPE FOR GARDIC?
- Phillis has a pipe, but she's going to give it to her Grandad for his
  birthday, because she can't afford anything more expensive.
- Is there anything you could give her instead?
- Phillis loves gemstones.
- Don't go on unless you've helped the injured man.
- Give her the gemstone you got from the injured man. You'll get the pipe
  for your generosity.
- Give the pipe to Gardic. A bit of an anti-climax, but he does point out
  that Minsk 'da Cat has appeared in the woods to the south.

WHAT IS THAT SMELL?
- Ask Pastor Jobe.
- He's not sure. Offer to investigate.
- The smell is coming from a plant in the south-east corner of the level.
- The plant is highly toxic and you can't touch it. Is there anything that
  might help you pick up a sample?
- Phillis is selling thick gardening gloves.
- Wearing gloves, pick up the seed pod and take it back to Pastor Jobe.
  He'll disappear with it - Joshua from the information building will
  visit you in the meantime for enhanced dramatics - and come back with
  200 gems for you. Yes!

WHY IS ELSTRIKA CRYING?
- Because her husband is missing.
- Why not cheer her up?
- Elstrika is vain and shallow, and likes pretty things.
- Like jewelery. But not the gem that Phillis is selling, strangely.
- Is anyone else selling jewelery?
- Barnabbas the Baboon is. He's in the Baboon's Butt Inn.
- Buy the ring and give it to Elstrika. You'll be invited in for dinner.
- Have dinner and you're invited to take anything from the house that isn't
  the clock. Take the ice hammer.
- If you ask her, Elstrika tells you that Jack the Hat is waiting for you
  down by the Pool of Dreams.

HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE LEVEL?
- Don't go on unless you've stopped Elstrika crying.
- Go to the Pool of Dreams. Jack the Hat will warn you that there's a
  knight sent to kill you.
- Go to the eastern end of the level, where the exit door is. There he is.
- Kill him!
- Shoot daggers at him rather than trying to slash him.
- He'll drop a key that opens the exit door.
- If you haven't already figured out, the mallet that Phillis sells will
  hammer down the gold pegs and let you through to the exit door.

HOW DO I GET A PASS FOR THE INFORMATION BUILDING?
- Rupert has one.
- But he's not giving it to you! "I'm no pushover you know!"
- Push Rupert over.
- You can do this by running into him at high speed.
- Phillis sells hyper boots.
- Activate the hyper boots and run into him. He'll drop the pass and you
  can pick it up. Once Joshua has been nice to you, you can give the pass
  back to Rupert and he won't even be cross!

HOW DO I HELP MINSK 'DA CAT?
- By getting him some cream. He suggests asking Phillis.
- Phillis suggests he lump it. You'll have to get him some yourself.
- There's some cream just at the start of the Caves level.
- Because you fed him, he'll turn up now and again offering hints in
  exchange for some gems.

HOW DO I REACH THE CHEST IN THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY?
- Turn both switches on, then both off. Ta-da! A pathway appears. And in
  the chest is a drill, which you'll need for the Caves level.

WHERE CAN I FIND THE BOOK OF RIDDLES?
- It's in the Information Building, and it's got three pages missing.
- All the pages are hidden in barrels.
- Don't go on unless you've got the shatter sword.
- There's a page in one of the barrels to the west of the Lake of
  Shimmering, on the north side of it. Use the shatter sword to open the
  barrels.
- There's a page in one of the barrels to the very north of the level,
  where the barrels block entry into an open-roofed building with a
  ghost in it.
- And there's a page in one of the barrels in the southern cornfields.


--- Level 3: Outlaws Cave ----------------------------------------------------

WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO HERE?
- Well, firstly, you're trying to get through it to reach the next level.
  But that's platform game tactics, an adventure would involve more than
  just that.
- Did you ask Jack or Rupert about the caves?
- Then you'll know there's a warrior called Taenith who's been turned into
  a baby. I suppose you'll have to find him AND find the way to the next
  level.

HELP! I'M STUCK RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL!
- You're not stuck in front of rock, are you? Perhaps a bomb might help?
- Well, maybe not then. If only you had a drill...
- If you explored the last level well enough, you should have one.
- See the 'How do I reach the chest in the House of Mystery' topic in the
  Gilliard's Rhine hints.
- Select the drill as your object and activate it while facing the rocks.

HELP! I'M STILL STUCK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL!
- You've blown the rocks away and are roaming freely on the westmost
  islands of the level. You'd be quite right to get angry at that.
- The only possible way across is at the north-east corner of the area. But
  as you can see, there's a large ravine which makes crossing impossible.
- What's that block on the other side?
- Hit it with a dagger. A path across the ravine should magically appear.

WHERE CAN I FIND THE SHATTER SWORD?
- Just as you cross the ravine at the start of the level, pass an
  alien creature and a rocky outcrop, just before some green snakes...
- ...go back to the right-hand side of the outcrop and walk against it.
  There's a secret doorway in the outcrop.
- And in that room is the shatter sword.

HOW DO I GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL?
- Well, you can see the exit in the north-east corner of the level. But it's
  surrounded by lava.
- At the southmost part of the level, slightly left-of-centre, is Gorlac
  (he's a statue). He'll transport you to the exit, if you can tell him a
  riddle that he hasn't heard before.

HOW DO I FIND A RIDDLE THAT GORLAC HASN'T HEARD BEFORE?
- There is a Book of Riddles, you know.
- It's incomplete - it's missing three pages. It needs to be complete
  before Gorlac finds a riddle he hasn't heard in it.
- See the 'Where can I find the Book of Riddles' topic in the Gilliard's
  Rhine hints for more information.
- Hand the completed book to him, and he'll open up a transporter that
  takes you to the level's exit.

WHERE DO I FIND TAENITH THE WARRIOR?
- Have you been to the south-east corner of the level?
- Still no luck?
- That large outcrop is a tunnel.
- Push against the left-hand wall of the outcrop until you find the way
  into it. The rest of the level is just a walkabout, with a transporter
  at the end. After transporting, you'll find Baby Taenith.
- Collect him and take him back to Rupert in Gilliard's Rhine. He'll magic
  him back into a warrior. You'll get some cutters for your trouble.

HOW DO I GET PAST THE FIRE?
- By drenching yourself in water.
- To the left of where you're standing is a staircase that leads to a
  swimming pool of water.
- If there's no water, then you didn't press the switch at the very
  beginning of this level! Go back and press it!
- Walk about in the water, then run back into the fire. You only have
  a few seconds, so be quick!


--- Level 4: Cow Tree Island -------------------------------------------------

WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO HERE?
- Help Enya's and Tomski's love life.
- Help Dickson the fisherman improve his fish catch.
- Help O'Gert out of his depression.
- Get the key to the Serenity Tree, and go in.

WHAT IS THAT STARFISH THINKING ABOUT?
- He's thinking about a spade and a gravestone.
- There's a spade available in this level.
- Tomski's selling one in his shop.
- There's a graveyard in this level too.
- Try digging in it.
- Try digging in front of the gravestones.
- If you dig in front of the frontmost gravestone, you'll find a magic
  wand.

HOW DO I GET ACROSS THE GAP WITH A BLUE SQUARE ON IT?
- What's on the blue square?
- A blue wand.
- Have you found a blue wand anywhere?
- Don't go on unless you know what the starfish is thinking about.
- Stand on the blue square and activate the blue wand. A path will appear.

HELP! A COW JUST SHAT ON ME!
- Eurrgh! It will wash off, though. But only in one particular place.
- At the north-east corner of the level is a building called the Arena.
  Go round the back of the Arena and you'll find the Pool of Purity,
  where the cow poo will wash off.
- It might be useful to smell, though.

HOW CAN I GO SWIMMING IN THE VENUS LAKE?
- Well, as Tomski said, you need a Safe Suit. It's a shame he doesn't have
  any in stock.
- Don't go on unless you've found a safe suit.
- Wearing your safe suit, you can enter the Venus Lake safely. But what's
  that in the centre of the lake?
- It's a teleport to a small island.
- In the flowers on this island, there is the Titan Fist. Wearing it, you
  can punch holes in walls.

WHERE CAN I GET A CLOAK OF INVISIBILITY?
- Don't go on unless you've been swimming in the Venus Lake and got yourself
  the Titan Fist.
- Have you seen any walls which look like they could have holes punched in
  them?
- There's one in the north-east corner of the Caves level. If you punch the
  outline of a doorway in that wall, you'll reveal a secret room, which
  contains the Cloak of Invisibility.

WHERE CAN I GET A SAFE SUIT?
- There's one in the big house just north of Tomski's shop.
- The house's owner doesn't want to let you in. He thinks you smell terrible.
- Is there any way you could smell worse?
- How about... covering yourself in manure?
- Walk near any cow and let them hit you. Urgh! Now revisit the house and
  the owner will pass out, allowing you to take his safe suit from his
  treasure chest.

WHERE CAN I GET A COMPASS?
- Don't go on unless you've improved Dickson the fisherman's fish catch.
- Once you have, the house with the locked door, overlooking the beach,
  will open up. Enter it.
- Inside, there's a glass case with a compass in it. Is there anything
  that could open the case?
- The Ice Hammer. Crack the glass case and take the compass.

HOW CAN I IMPROVE DICKSON THE FISHERMAN'S FISH CATCH?
- So you've talked to Dickson, right? And been nice to him?
- So you want to help him. In the south-east corner of the
  beach, there's a fish called Wonder.
- Wonder wants revenge and will scheme with you to get it. Just tell him
  that Dickson's catch is low and he'll offer to arrange a big catch.
- Now go back to Dickson and tell him to put his rod in the water.
- Soon enough, he'll land a huge catch and invite you to his house.
- Of course, if you'd just been mean to him all the time when you first
  met him, he'd clean his act up and get a job, and still invite you to
  his house.

HOW CAN I IMPROVE TOMSKI'S AND ENYA'S LOVE LIFE?
- Have you talked to Tomski about Enya?
- Have you talked to Enya about Tomski?
- Have you talked to Tomski about Enya again?
- Have you talked to Enya about Tomski again?
- All very tedious... Enya wants proof that Tomski loves her.
- There's a love letter in the private room in Tomski's shop.
- Obviously Tomski won't let you in there. You'll have to sneak in.
- Don't go on unless you've got the Cloak of Invisiblity.
- Activate the cloak and sneak past Tomski. There you'll meet an old man
  called Zeeash, who will give you important news about Gallus and a
  warrior called Daythan (who you'll rescue in the next level). But you'll
  also find a love letter!
- Remember to take the cloak off or you'll die.
- Give the love letter to Enya.
- Finally, talk to Tomski about Enya and Enya about Tomski once more.

HOW CAN I STOP O'GERT'S DEPRESSION?
- Cheer him up. A joke would help.
- Don't go on unless you've solved the Mystery Square.
- Give him the joke book. He'll now translate a sign in Sandoon for you.

HOW DO I SOLVE THE MYSTERY SQUARE PUZZLE?
- "Four switches in four rooms quite near, when all turned on, an object
  will appear."
- There are four houses that don't otherwise have a purpose in the level.
  In each one is a transporter that takes you to a switch.
- Simply turn all four switches on. A jokebook will appear in the square.
- You can get in the square by using the mallet. But you should know that.

HOW DO I GET THE KEY TO THE SERENITY TREE?
- Don't go on unless you've improved Dickson's fish catch, improved Enya
  and Tomski's love life AND stopped O'Gert's depression.
- If you've done all that, you should find that the Serenity Tree woman is
  in the Arena with Enya. She wants to tell Enya something... in private.
- Simply wear the Cloak of Invisibility and enter the Arena. If you wait
  around, you'll be able to eavesdrop on the pair.
- The Serenity Tree woman has hidden the key to the Serenity Tree in the
  secret room at the back of the Arena!
- Rush round the back of the Arena and enter the room. Remember to take the
  cloak off. Get the key and open the Serenity Tree with it. On to level 5!


--- Level 5: The Tunnel Networks ---------------------------------------------

WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO HERE?
- Get through the level, of course.
- Oh, and you should save Daythan too.

HELP! THE REACTOR WILL BLOW UP IN TEN MINUTES!
- Don't panic.
- Visit the reactor. It's in the green building, on the main eastern
  bridge.
- So, there's a bomb there. Pick it up and find someone to defuse it.
- Give it to the yellow robot. Phew!

I'M STUCK! HOW DO I GET ANY FURTHER?
- Did you get a hint from the cat?
- Have you turned that red teleporter over the south bridge into a blue,
  working teleporter?
- You'll need to toggle three switches. Each one is behind a gate.
- One is also behind a big electric arc. Blow up the arc with a bomb in the
  centre of it.
- Toggle all 3 switches.
- Ta-da! Now you can teleport to the rest of the level.

HOW DO I GET THROUGH THESE GATES?
- With a key, of course!
- Only one fits each gate, but there's only four to pick from so it
  shouldn't be difficult. Choose the right key as your object and walk into
  the gate, which will then open.

WHERE ARE ALL THE KEYS?
- There's one just after the tunnel at the start of the level, in the
  chest to the left.
- There's one in the house.
- There's one just over the bridge, next to the teleporter.
- And there's one in a secret room, in the right wall of the tunnel at
  the start of the level.

WHERE'S DAYTHAN?
- On the stretch of corridor with the yellow robot, there's the outline of
  a door on the wall. Do you remember how to 'open' these doors?
- Use the Titan Fist.
- Daythan's just north, all tied up.

HOW CAN I FREE DAYTHAN?
- Do you have any cutters?
- If not, then you didn't solve the 'Taenith the Warrior' puzzle on levels
  2 and 3. Go back and solve it.
- Free Daythan with the cutters. You'll get some Miracle Grow.

HOW CAN I GET PAST THE GUARD?
- There's two guards.
- One of them is in the guardhouse, asleep. Every so often, they change
  about. One goes to sleep and the other wakes up.
- What if the sleeping one didn't wake up?
- Give him some sleeping pills and wait for the changeover.
- Give the other guard sleeping pills too.

WHERE CAN I GET SLEEPING PILLS?
- Have you been in the gate north of the teleporter you activated?
- If you haven't got the key, see the 'Where are all the keys' topic.
- There's some sleeping pills in the chest there. As far as I can see,
  the switch there does nothing.

HEY! I'VE LEFT THE LEVEL BUT I'M BACK ON LEVEL 4! WHAT GIVES?
- You didn't give sleeping pills to both the guards. One would
  wake up and catch you if you came back from level 6.

WHAT DOES THE SWITCH IN THE SECRET ROOM NORTH OF DAYTHAN DO?
- It changes the destination of the transporter that took you there.
- Go back into the secret room after teleporting out. You'll now find
  a chest with a stone bottle in it.

--- Level 6: Makiah, Garden of O`Talia ---------------------------------------

WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO HERE?
- First, you'll have to reach the main part of the Garden.
- There's a twig at the top of the sheer cliff-face.
- Don't go on unless you freed Daythan in the previous level.
- Put some Miracle Grow on the twig and it'll turn into a tree,
  allowing you passage up the cliff. Now explore!
- You can help the trapped monk, Brother Yan.
- You can help the little girl, Tanyo.
- You can even help Folliock, when he wakes up.
- If you've done all that, getting to the next level should be easy.

HOW CAN I FREE THE TRAPPED MONK?
- If you could float him over the gap, that would work.
- Don't go on unless you've swapped miracles with the Monkian.
- Fire the floating miracle at Brother Yan until he floats across.
  Don't worry, he isn't of evil intent.
- When the gap heals, you'll get a bowl of caramel in the chest at the
  back of the monastery.

WHAT CAN I DO WITH THE MONKIAN?
- Talk to him. He'll offer to swap miracles with you.
- Invisibility is a miracle.
- Wear your cloak and enter his circle. Wait until you automatically speak
  to him.
- Give him your cloak and he'll give you a floating miracle.

HOW CAN I HELP TANYO?
- Ask her.
- She wants the river unblocked.

HOW DO I UNBLOCK THE RIVER?
- The beaver has a weakness for desserts.
- Don't go on unless you've freed the trapped monk.
- If you go back in the monastery, the gap will have gone and there will be
  a big bowl of caramel in the chest at the back.
- Give the caramel to the beaver. He'll move. Go to Tanyo, and she'll give
  you a whetstone.

WHAT CAN I DO WITH THE STRANGE STONES AT THE WELL?
- One says "R", one says "G" and the other says "B".
- Have you ever done work with colours?
- R, G and B stand for Red, Green and Blue. There are three sheets around
  the level, coloured red, green and blue.
- The red sheet is buried in the garden at the back of Tanyo's house. Use
  your spade on the brown patch like you did in the graveyard on Cow Tree
  Island.
- The green sheet should be lying on the bench where Folliock is sleeping.
- The blue sheet is hanging on the washing line outside Tanyo's house, once
  you've dug up the red sheet and talked to Tanyo.
- Use the red sheet on the "R" stone, the green sheet on the "G" stone and
  the blue sheet on the "B" stone. A little puppy will appear in the well.
  Take him on your travels.

HOW DO I HELP FOLLIOCK?
- He won't wake up unless you've helped Tanyo.
- Once he is awake, he'll be mowing the lawn in the north-east corner of
  the level. His mower blades are blunt.
- Give him the whetstone.
- Come back in a while, and he'll be finished, asleep on the bench and he'll
  have left a green key on the lawn.
- The key opens the main greenhouse.

HOW DO I GET OUT OF THE LEVEL?
- Don't go on unless you've helped Folliock.
- He left a green key on the lawn. It opens the main greenhouse, just next
  to the lawn.
- Enter the greenhouse and press the switch there. The broken transporter
  in the north-west corner of the level will be activated. Go to it and
  you are transported to the exit.

--- Level 7: The Sandoon Hideout ---------------------------------------------

WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO HERE?
- You're in a 5 by 5 area of screens, starting at the south-east corner. In
  the north-west corner is the exit, and the hideout mentioned in the title.
- In the hideout is an evil creature that needs waking.
- Wake him, kill him, and take the key he drops to the exit, just to the
  left of the hideout.

HELP! I DON'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ANYWHERE!
- You need a compass.
- See "Where can I get a compass" in the Cow Tree Island hints.

HELP! I KEEP DYING OF DEHYDRATION!
- You need water! There's plenty of that.
- But nothing to carry it in.
- Don't go on unless you've visited the secret room north of Daythan. If
  that didn't make sense, browse the level 5 hints.
- Enter any pool of water and activate your stone bottle to fill it.

HELP! THE SCORPION GOT ME!
- I hope you saved the game.
- There's an anti-toxin potion way back in level 1. The ice has melted
  around it.

THERE'S A SIGN I CAN'T TRANSLATE IN THE HIDEOUT.
- You didn't cheer up O'Gert in Cow Tree Island then, did you?
- Go back and do it.

--- Level 8: Spiral Castle ---------------------------------------------------

WHAT AM I MEANT TO DO HERE?
- First, you'll have to get in the castle.
- Then you have to get Gallus. It's as simple as that.

HOW DO I GET IN THE CASTLE?
- The guard won't let you in while he's awake.
- Do you see that cabinet in the centre of the room?
- Using your red strength potion, push it to the right. Now blow open the
  wall behind it with a bomb. In the room you've revealed is a bottle of
  alcohol. Give it to the guard and he'll fall asleep.

HOW DO I GET GALLUS?
- You'll have to find out where he is.
- The sleeping boy might know, if you woke him up.
- So, Gallus is in the east wing, eh?
- Ask Gercroon about getting in to the east wing.
- Gercroon says you need a key from Kaizey, the cook.
- Go back to Kaizey and now she's in the dining area rather than the
  kitchen. Ask her about getting a room.
- There are no rooms available. Rather strangely, to progress, you now have
  to poison Gallus's food and for some reason the entry to the east wing
  is left open if you do that.
- Don't go any further unless you have the poison.
- Bomb your way into the kitchen using the outline of a door on the wall
  in the dining area.
- Use the poison on Gallus's food.
- Make your way to the east wing and enter it. It's a door in the
  right-hand side of the long north corridor. It should now be simple
  enough to make your way southwards into the other rooms in the east wing.
  Which room should you choose? The one with the meal outside it, of
  course!
- Now all you have to do is kill the evil creature that Gallus has challenged
  you to. This is quite tough.
- But it's much easier if you use the floating miracle as a weapon, because
  it always fires forward, allowing you to run left and right. After you've
  dispatched the beast, sit back and wait for the end credits to roll!

HOW DO I WAKE THE SLEEPING BOY?
- You have to collect ten notes. They are scattered all over the castle
  and are easy to find.
- After you've collected all ten notes, activate the note in your inventory
  and play the notes at the boy.

WHERE ARE ALL TEN NOTES?
- There's one in the chest to the left of the castle just as you entered it.
- There are two in the chests in the north-west corner of the castle.
- There's one in the passage near the sleeping boy.
- There's one in the room with Dooprect.
- There's one north of the skeletons.
- There's one in the room with the cat.
- There's one in the long corridor going north.
- There's one in the bedroom.
- Finally, there's one in a hidden room that's only revealed to you if
  you "truly know" Gercroon.

HOW DO I "TRULY KNOW" GERCROON?
- "There is only one way to truly know Gercroon".
- By attacking him with your sword. All the other Gercroons are holograms
  and aren't hurt by it.

HELP! I'M TRAPPED IN A ROOM WITH DOOPRECT!
- Dooprect hates dogs.
- If you don't have a dog, you're stuck! You should have solved the well
  problem in Makiah. Otherwise, drop your dog and it will eventually get
  too close for comfort, and Dooprect will let you go. Don't forget to take
  the dog back again.

WHERE DO I GET THE POISON?
- At the top of the long north corridor, there is a room to the east that
  is blocked by a mouse. If you could enter there and go east, there would
  be poison in the chest there.
- You have to frighten the mouse away.
- Drop your dog in front of it. The mouse will run away and let you get to
  the poison. Remember to pick the dog up again.
