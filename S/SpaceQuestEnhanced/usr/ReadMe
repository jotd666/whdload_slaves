 This install applies to "Space Quest I (Enhanced)" © 1991 Sierra.

 Thanks to BTTR for original disk images

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.2 (26.05.2022) done by JOTD:
 - removed copy protection using UrBi script files
   (check at the bottom of the readme to see how to upgrade)
 
 version 2.1 (08.05.2021) done by JOTD:
 - fixed installation issue that prevented MT32 to work (issue #0005160)
 - provided 512k chip slave. Sound is really degraded/bad with that one. If you
   have 1MB chipmem use the standard slave. Enable midi if you can too!
   
 version 2.0 (23.04.2021) done by JOTD:
 - fixed crash when saving on 68000 machines (issue #0005145)
 - the only supported version is SPS2222. Another version used to be supported
   but I don't have it anymore. Contact me if you get an unsupported version message
 - dynamic support for MT32 sound (custom4). Game needs to be reinstalled or extra
   files copied to "data" subdir (res_mt32.cfg, mt32.drv, serial.device)

 version 1.3 (20.01.2019) done by JOTD:
 - added support for Roland MT32 (issue #0004048): unpack the "mt32_support.zip"
   archive into "data" directory, overwriting the "resource.cfg" file and adding
   missing "serial.device" and "mt32.drv" files
 - reassembled with latest kickemu sources
 
 version 1.2 (16.11.2005)
 - some more access faults fixed (Thanks Hubert for reporting them)
 - another version supported
 - install script fixed

 version 1.1 (10.08.2003)
 - enhanced music (thanks to Seppo Seppala for telling me about chipmem size)
 - adapted for WHDLoad v16

 version 1.0 (26.07.2003) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - access fault fixed
 - saves redirected to "save" directory
 - solution from Space Quest 1 included (slightly adapted to the enhanced version)
 - protection is not removed, but you can display code sheets anytime
   by holding keys on the keyboard:
   * F2 displays cartridge codes (the ones needed right at the beginning)
   * F3 displays steering codes
 - printable IFF codesheet provided

 note: when using MT32, quit properly when music is not playing. WHDLoad doesn't stop
 the midi play. If you quit without doing this, just run the game again and let it cut
 the sound, then quit.
 
 a file in the installation was not named properly and not checked... Murphy's law
 there was a file "res_mt32cfg" in the install pack that needs to be copied and named "res_mt32.cfg".
 (now the name is fixed in the install BTW). That or re-install from scratch.
 
 COPY PROTECTION:
 
 To benefit from copy-protection (hacked scripts by UrBi) either reinstall the game or
 just copy the files 103.SCR and 400.SCR in "data"
