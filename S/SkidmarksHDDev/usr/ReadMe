 This install applies to "Skidmarks" Â© 1993 Acid Software.

 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 2.0 (ECS) to 3.0 (AGA) MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.1 (xx.11.2020) done by JOTD:
 - fixed sound effects replay on fast machines

 version 1.0 (21.01.2005) done by JOTD:
 - initial WHDLoad release
 - RawDIC imager (adapted from my 1996 disk ripper !!)
 - 2 slaves, one for ECS (less fast memory needed), one for AGA
 - to avoid installing AGA cars for ECS users, just quit the installation
   after RawDIC installed disk 2
 - source code included

 version 0.001 (back to 1996) done by JOTD
 - DOS patch lamely adapted from the Fairlight DOS HD version
 - Hardware banging disk ripper

 Notes:

 - Only version 1.06 is supported (I think this is the latest one)

 - Thanks to Fairlight for the dos hd install I adapted. To use this install with
   the Fairlight HD version, simply create a "data" directory, copy all files in it,
   and rename the file "Skid_Data" to "Skidmarks". Remove "loader" file (not needed)

 - I don't know if the modem connection works with the WHDLoad install. I don't know
   if many ppl still have a dialup modem to test it. I'm curious to hear from you
   if you test it.
