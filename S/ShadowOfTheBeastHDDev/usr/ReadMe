 This install applies to "Beast" © 1989 Psygnosis.

 This install requires WHDLoad and The Patcher to be in the path. Both can be
 found in the WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

 version 2.1 (28.04.2003) done by JOTD
 - decrunch routine relocated in fastmem for better loading speed
 - some blitterwaits were incorrect and caused gfx bugs. This is now fixed
 - source code included, Trodas check the src, and when you understand something
   about it I'll talk to you again (not a chance)...

 version 2.0 (16.04.2003) done by JOTD
 - many blitterwaits fixed: no more gfx bugs and crashes
 - updated install package
 - added icons by Frank, Exoticons, ...
 - added manual and solution
 - use CACHE for better loading speed, but soundfx may be a bit trashed

 version 1.0 (1997?) done by Harry:
 - initial release
 - 2 versions supported
 - Fixed: protection check caused a stackframe error.
 - Toggle energytrainer with F1 on/off. No complete trainer, its senseless:
   if you hang in an abyss you couldnt get out.

Comment: That was a funny one with 2 ingameprotectionchecks and 
	 5 memorychecksums, also in the interrupt. Enjoy this graphical
	 wonder of Psygnosis!
