ABOUT THE PROJECT
----------------- 
Ever since I can remember, we always wanted to produce a super-playable
platform game in the classic style.  Much like what we did with Project X
in the shoot'em-up mould.  The idea of Super frog had been around for a
considerable time and it was a matter of finishing up other projects before
we got around to completing the project.
 
Now it's finished we believe we have the game and character that is ageless
in appeal and will hopefully become a milestone on the Amiga.  Technically
we have squeezed the machine very hard, so much so that I doubt if more
could be done.
 
The true test of course is what you, as the player, think of the game.
We had excellent feedback during development and I firmly believe that you
will look upon Super Frog as an excellent purchase and one that will give
you, your friends and your family, many hours of considerable
entertainment.
 
As for the team listed above, we're back on the Alien Breed 2 assignment.
Working with a cute green frog who hasn't got a gun has been, shall we say,
different!
 
Martyn Brown, Project Manager, Super Frog.
 
 
SUPER FROG: ALMOST A FAIRY TALE 
-------------------------------
Hi there and a warm welcome to magic land.  Former home of the magic prince
and his lovely bride to be.  All was peace and harmony until the wicked
witch lived up to those fabled Danish fairy tales and predictably turned
the poor old prince into nothing more than a little green frog...  But...
it was only a matter of a few hours beside the river bank (being Prince's
far less statley new home) when a strange bottle floated past.  Intriguied,
he grabbed it and drank from bottle and the rest is history.  Or at least
it will be sooner or later.
 

COMPATABILITY AND OTHER NOTES
----------------------------- 
SUPER FROG has been tested on an extensive variety of AMIGA machines and
works on all varieties, from the A500 to the A4000 including the CDTV/1200.
Should you experience any difficulties then it is probably the case of
faulty or corrupt disks, in any case please refer to the TROUBLESHOOTING
guide.  If you have external drives connected, you may use those during
play.
 
SUPER FROG is not hard drive installable.  The disks that SUPER FROG are
supplied on are not the usual AmigaDOS format and writing to them will most
likely result in damage, so ALWAYS keep them write protected.


RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------- 
SUPER FROG is controlled from the joystick in port 2, the gameport next to
the one where the mouse is usually located.  Turn any auto fire off before
play as the game will not function correctly with auto fire enabled.
 
Hooking your AMIGA'S sound output through an amplifier or your HIFI will
result in even further enjoyment of the exellent music during the game.
 
Your SUPER FROG disks carry on disk protection and cannot be backed up.
So long as you treat them with care and keep them write protected they will
give you trouble free operation.  Keep them away from strong magnetic
sources such as the top of TV'S/MONITORS and speakers.  If your disks do
become faulty by spilling coffee or whatever else on them, then please
refer to the returns guide.
 

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
Turn your Amiga OFF at the power supply and wait 10 seconds.  Turn it back
on again and continue the instructions as laid out below - this ensures
your system is clear of all other data.
 
When the usual insert disk prompt appears you can insert either the story
disk or game disk 1.
 
Inserting game disk 1 will load the game straight away, missing out the
introductory animation.
 
If after a short while nothing has appeared on screen or the insert disk
prompt still remains, then repeat the instructions once more and consult
the TROUBLESHOOTING guide for futher help and information.
 

MAIN MENU
--------- 
When the game has loaded and the SUPER FROG character is on screen,
pressing your button will reveal two selections:  START GAME and OPTIONS.

 
GAME OPTIONS
------------ 
You can move through the various selections with the joystick, using fire
to toggle the various options.  When you are satisfied you can return to
the main menu and start the game.
 
LIVES:            Selectable between 1, 3 or 5.  (Default is 3)
 
SKILL LEVEL:      Easy or Normal.  Easy gives you a slightly slower type
                  of control, more game time etc.  (Default is Normal)
 
SAVE HIGH SCORES: You can save your high scores to a data disk to keep a
                  permanent record of your achievement.  You should NOT
                  use your SUPER FROG disks for this purpose.
 
LEVEL CODES:      During the game you will be given codes to restart at
                  various levels, these can be typed in here.


START GAME
---------- 
If you have one of the LEVEL CODES as described earlier you may jump into
the game at a later level, so there's no need to cover old ground (unless
you feel that you need the practice or a big score!) otherwise you start at
the beginning, in the magic woods as SUPER FROG sets off in his quest to
vanquish his froggy curse, get back his girl and teach that old witch a
lesson or two!
 

GAME PLAY
--------- 
The game is divided into worlds, of which there are six major ones, in each
world there are a number of levels and you must complete all the levels in
order to advance through that world and on to the next.
 

MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND
------------------------------- 
To complete a level you must collect a certain number of coins, which acts
as a toll fee (even in magic worlds, bills must be paid, appearence fee's
met and so on) - this is shown on the large coin in the bottom right hand
corner of the screen.  When all the coins have been collected, the exit
will open and you can progress further.
 

THE TIME ELEMENT AND BONUS AWARDS
---------------------------------
You will also notice that when you start, a timer begins to count down.
This represents the time you have left before your SUPER POWERS run out and
you turn into a normal frog once more.  Which in effect means that the game
is over.  To counter this effect, SUPER FROG must find and drink bottles of
LUCOZADE to maintain this SUPER ENERGY.  In the first few worlds there is
plenty of LUCOZADE scattered about, but as you progress it becomes
increasingly rare and this means that you have to move quicker and be more
thoughtful in your approach.
 
Collecting fruit gives you points and also counts towards the SUPER BONUS
award and the conclusion of each of the games levels.  You are awarded
credits for the amount of time left (increased by collecting more
LUCOZADE), the number of fruit collected and also the number of coins
collected (including all the hidden ones).  You are then given the chance
to change these credits into points, or gamble them on the bonus game.
(See bonus game)
 

SPECIAL ITEMS
-------------
You will also find a number of special powers scattered around for your
use, these are detailed below:
 
WINGS
 
Enables you to fly by quickly pressing your button when in the air, this
helps perform greater leaps.  You cannot stay airborne forever though and
sooner or later you'll drop back down to earth.
 
DESTRUCTO-SPUD
 
This little green blob does your dirty work, you can throw him at airborne
ememies and knock them to the ground.  To fire SPUD, hold down your
joystick button when you are standing still (it will not work in the air).
You can also fire SPUD upwards and to the side by pressing the relevent
direction whilst holding fire down.
 
INVISIBILITY PILL
 
This little ped pill renders our hero invisible to his enemies for a short
term, which obviously has its advantages.
 
SPEED PILL
 
These come in two forms, SPEEDUP (green) and SLOWDOWN (red) and are
obvious as to what they do.  Speed pills are usually placed in a position
where speed is either necessary or useful and not in places where going
fast would be a hindrance, such as a particularly tricky jumping section.
 
LUCOZADE
 
This prolongs you SUPER ENERGY and also acts to boost your bonus award at
the end of each level.  The more LUCOZADE you get, the more time you will
have, the better score you will achive.  It pays to find those golden
bottles!
 
RESTART PILL
 
This red pill with a large "R" on it enables you to restart at this point
should you lose a life.  On the early worlds, these pills are pretty
frequent, enabling you to get further into the game more quickly.

 
OTHER ITEMS
-----------
Other special items, such as JEWELS, CROWNS and so on, can be found in
particular worlds and levels.  These add greatly to your score and are well
worth seeking.  You are awarded an extra frog every 200,000 points.


CONTROLLING SUPER FROG
----------------------
The controls have been made as simple as possible, allowing precision and
comfort on the joystick.
 
Pushing left/right will move the frog left/right.  Pushing up will make
SUPER FROG jump, pushing up and keeping the joystick up will make him jump
a little higher.
 
Pressing the fire button has no effect unless he has collected a special
item such as WINGS or he is carrying his friend SPUD.  (See special items).
 
When in flight you can move SUPER FROG right/left and manouvre him over
dangerous obstacles and enemies.  If you tap the joystick in the opposite
direction, he will drop straight down, allowing you to control where he
lands/drops.
 
You can attack various enemies from the air, such as the snails and blue
blobs on world one.  This will SPLAT them and enables you to clear the
world and collect a fruit bonus in the process.  Some enemies, the bird and
hedgehog in world one for example, cannot be destroyed and it is for you to
discover which in other worlds.  The best way to find out is to get an
invisibility pill and try jumping on the enemies!  Airborne enemies such as
the bats and wasps can be jumped on or blasted by SPUD.

It's common sense to avoid things like fire, spikes and so on.  Frogs, even
SUPER ones are generally soft, gooey creatures that do not enjoy such
contact.


LEVEL ONE HINTS
---------------
To get you started, you should note that LEVEL 1 has two hidden sections
and that the blobs, snails and wasps can all be squashed by jumping on
them.


BONUS GAME: FRUIT MACHINE
-------------------------
After the SUPER AWARD at the end of each level, you are given credits which
you can turn into points, or use on the FRUIT MACHINE.  In the FRUIT
MACHINE you can try and win level codes, extra lives and massive advances
(all numbers shown mean thousands of points).  Playing the machine is
simple enough and can be done with either the joystick or mouse.
 
In general whenever something is lit on the far right, you have won that
amount (in thousands) and you can either COLLECT it, or opt to GAMBLE IT,
where the outcome could be either of the other two flashing squares above
and below it.  The HI-LO feature enables you to gamble on the spin of a
number (1-10) and progress through the features on the right side.
 
The JACKPOT (gained by gambling, through the HI-LO feature or by getting
three LUCOZADE cans) rewards you with points for remaining credits, a hefty
score bonus and the code to start at the next level whenever you play
again!


GAME OVER
---------
After each contact with an enemy, you lose one unit of energy.  When you
lose five units of energy, a life is lost.
 
The game ends when your supply of lives is spent or you run out of SUPER
ENERGY time (which shouldn't happen as there is plenty of LUCOZADE on each
level to enable it to be completed comfortably).
