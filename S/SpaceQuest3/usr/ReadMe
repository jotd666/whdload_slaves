 This install applies to "Space Quest 3 - The Pirates of Pestulon" © 1989 Sierra.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.1 (24.01.2021) done by JOTD:
 - MT32 switch didn't work at all on german version (issue #0004959)
 - fixed crash on 68000 (issue #0004960)
 
 version 2.0 (17.01.2021)
 - german version: found a way to avoid entering umlauts by using the alternate
   spelling (ue, oe) instead. Example: type "oeffnen" and it will switch to the umlaut
   syntax that the game understands (issue #0004644)
 - source rework so the new sound patch system can be dynamically chosen for german version
   which has MT32 support (issue #0004957)
 - source rework also provides selectable keyboard layout (english, french, german)
   
 version 1.2-B (13.07.2014)
 - reassembled with latest kickemu
 - added notes for german users & savegame notes

 version 1.2 (08.01.2006)
 - fixed access fault in english version (not found in the german version)

 version 1.1 (08.09.2003)

 - game saves are now located in the current directory, not "saves" anymore
 - adapted to WHDLoad v16

 version 1.0 (26.07.2003) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - original quit option activated
 - save games to HD
 - manual & walkthrough included
 - source code included

 GERMAN USERS PLEASE READ:
 - The game has been reported as buggy because users could not enter special
   german chars (umlauts). It is not true. To enter "offnen" with a "trema" on the 'o',
   press o, then press the "trema" key => character o is replaced by the
   character o+trema. That was the original way of doing it. The new slave version
   is able to detect "oe" and "ue" sequences and replaces them by the corresponding umlaut.
   Deleting an umlaut expands back to the sequence, just in case the umlaut is not what the user
   wanted.
   
 ENGLISH USERS PLEASE READ:
 - The english version is an early version without MT32 sound support. The german version has
   MT32 sound support, but can be switched to full english with the language menu (sierra / sprache)

 SAVING GAME ADVICE
 - like most whdload installed games, after saving your position to disk, avoid
   switching off your amiga/closing UAE like you would do on a standard game.
   Instead, quit the game / return to WB using WHDLoad quit key, or you will
   lose your game saves (could explain issue #002630)
