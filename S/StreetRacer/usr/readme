Previous versions (1997-):

- Runs fully from HD, starts from Workbench, using WHDLoad
- Installer script provided
- Access faults/programming error removed
- SNOOP problems fixed
- Decrunch routines/clearmem routines relocated in fastmem for better speed
- Quit key (QUITKEY for WHDload)
- Nice new/glow icons by Frank
- Stack fix by Keith Krellwitz (on the old JST slave)
- Keyboard fixed
- CPU dependent loops fixed

Notes:

- Thanks to Bored Seal, Juergen Urbanek, Xavier Bodenand & Hexaae for bug reports
- Run in NTSC for better speed (this is default, remove if you wish)
- On the options screen, you have either to plug a joystick in port 0 or unplug
  the mouse because there's a control bug (the same as in Chaos Engine 2) if
  mouse is in port 0.
- Original CD version was done in 1997 by JOTD with the help of Abaddon. It was released
  as a commercial game. It must be the first (and only) game using JST in a commercial form.
  Original files were ripped from the original floppy disc by JOTD for the CD version
