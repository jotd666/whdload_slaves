 This patch applies to "Super Methane Bros" (c) 1993 Apache - 2 disks/CD32.
 Thanks to Carlo Pirri for the original 2 disk version, and Chris Vella and 
 Mike West for the CD32 version! You can download the enhanced version of the
 game (without protection) from Ami Sector One at http://amiga.emucamp.com

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The CD32 version of the game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Slave requires WHDLoad V17
- Disk game requires 1Mb chip mem (+1.8Mb other memory for preload option)
- CD32 game requires 1.9Mb chip mem (+0.5Mb, +2.1Mb other memory for preload option) & kickstart 3.1 (see above)

FEATURES:
- Full load from HD
- Access fault removed
- Blitter waits inserted
- RomIcon, NewIcon and GlowIcon (created by me!)
- Quit option (default key is '*' on keypad)
- Help to toggle trainer (infinite lives!)

it seem to jump between moune and cd32 controller getting pass the title screen is brutal ingame no issues 

Version 2.0 (08.08.2019) done by JOTD:

- CD32 version adapted to kickemu 3.1 & better lowlevel emulation: joypad buttons work (pause,jump),
  and a 2-button joystick also allows to jump with second button in joypad mode (issue #0004128)
- CD32 version can also be paused with P if no joypad is available
- CD32 version can quit to wb during game with rev+fwd+play
- resourced & reassembled floppy & CD32 versions after source had been lost
- source code included

Version 1.3 (15.07.2001) done by Codetapper/Action:
- Fixed bug in the original disk version which caused the game to return
  to the titles after one or two levels (thanks to Juergen Urbanek for
  the report!)

Version 1.2:
- Disk requester no longer appears (in disk version!)
- Fixed snoop bugs in both versions

Version 1.1:
- Supports CD32 version
- Access faults fixed
- Detects PAL/NTSC screen modes based on PAL/NTSC tooltype
- CD32 non-volatile storage code removed
- CD32 version defaults to joystick control rather than CD32 joypad
- Icons now have 10240 bytes for the stack
- Decruncher relocated to fast memory (both versions)
- Loads and saves high scores (both versions - unless you cheat!)
- Help to toggle trainer (infinite lives - screen will now flash)


As usual, if you cheat then none of your scores will be saved to disk!
