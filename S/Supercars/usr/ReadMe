- Full load from HD

- Protection removed
- Blitter wait inserted

  status at any point when you press 'S')

CD32 JOYPAD CONTROLS:
- play: pause (p/space)
- reverse+forward (while paused): aborts current game (esc)
- reverse: throws rear missile (replaces "down")
- forward: throws front missile (replaces "up")
- reverse+forward+yellow: quits to workbench (quitkey)

note that 2 button joysticks aren't useful here, since blue button isn't used

CHEAT MODE:
- Enter your name as any of the following for various effects:

           Start on the second level with $20000 _______ "ODIE"
           Start on the third level with $50000 ________ "BIGC"
           Start with $500000 __________________________ "RICH"

Whenever you press 'S', the settings are saved to disk (unless you cheated
and used *any* of the above codewords). To recall your previously saved 
settings, enter "LOAD" as your name. "LOAD" will appear as the default name 
if a save file was found. The name will be replaced in game by the original
name you used from when you first created the save game.

This install has taken me a long time, but the game is one of my favourites
of all time so it deserves a quality fix. The save feature in particular
took ages simply because it saves everything about the current game so you
can resume it in it's exact state later!

Tom Meades kindly sent his GBH version of this game and it seems that the
disk was duplicated with multiple runs of the sync markers on the disk. 
Sometimes the imager found the "wrong" one and would then complain about 
checksum errors. I have altered the imager to search for the next sync,
but the slave itself did not require updating.

Please note that if you are using WinUAE, you will experience some weird
crashes if you are not using cycle exact settings.

Greetings to Jean-François Fabre for the original JST install, all Action 
members, my testing crew and the entire WHDLoad team!
