 TIPS:

 Scanner
 ~~~~~~~
 A bit of advice about the scanner - try not to use it! Although it's
 nice to know what's waiting for you when you enter a room, it also gives
 the aliens the chance to move in and attack you.

 Marching Orders
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 It's a good idea to keep your squad fairly tight. Stragglers make easy
 targets. However, don't bunch them too tightly together. Set off a booby
 trap and, if Lady Luck rolls the dice against you, the whole squad could
 be wiped out in one fell swoop.

 The bolter-carrying marine is the least effective member of the team and
 is fairly expandable. Use him as a scout to open doors and the like.

 By Your Commander
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The commander is naturally the hardest geezer in your squad of marines,
 so use him wisely. For a start, when tooling him up give him a powerfist
 and a powersword. Although this means he can't engage in any long-range
 combat because he had no gun or missile launcher, it does make him super
 powerfull in hand-to-hand battles and when the aliens start amassing
 this can be a real life saver for all concerned.

 Your commander has six hit points and so can afford to lose one.
 Your grunts, however with their measly one hit point, can't.
 In a big firefight with a gang of marauding orcs or gretchins, place
 your commander in between your marines and the aliens to absorb some
 of the shots and protect the boys.

 On retrieval missions, always use your commander to pick up the object.
 Use a grunt and chances are he'll get killed before you get off the ship.

 Melta bombs are by far the most effective one-off weapon available.
 Use it to fry a Dreadnough or any other tough cookies encountered.

 Tidy Your Room
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you're exploring and you come across a bunch of monsters, make sure
 you mop them all up before moving on. A feeble gretchin, left to it's
 own devices, can decimate a squad if the dice rolls are in its favour.

 In a room packed with aliens use a Blind Grenade and, if possible, a
 Fire Order card - this should wipe them out in no time at all.
 This technique is particularly handy on Level 2.

 Missile launchers are excellent for mass alien slayings. If there's a
 whole bunch of them standing together fire the missile between them -
 with good aiming and luck on your side you could wipe them all out in
 one go. Remember to use targetters with missile launchers and power guns.

 The Lone Warrior
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Even if you're playing a solo game, still use the other marine chapters.
 They will help spread out the Alien Event cards and keep some of the
 nastier ones off your back.
