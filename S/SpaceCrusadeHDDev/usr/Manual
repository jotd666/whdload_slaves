QUICK START GUIDE


WE ARE SURE THAT YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO GET BLASTING THE ALIENS RIGHT AWAY.  WE
WOULD ADVISE YOU HOWEVER, TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES AND THEIR
IMPLEMENTATION BEFORE YOU DO.  KNOWING THAT THIS ADVICE WILL GENERALLY BE
IGNORED, WE HAVE INCLUDED A `QUICKSTART` MODE WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO PLAY
THE FIRST MISSION WITH ALL THE CHAPTERS ARMED WITH A DEFAULT SET OF WEAPONS,
EQUIPMENT AND ORDER.  ALL YOU WILL NEED TO DO IS SELECT THE NUMBER OF
PLAYERS.  THIS IS DONE BY CLICKING ON THE `CHAPTER SELECT` ICON ON THE MAIN
OPTION SCREEN.  THIS TAKES YOU TO THE SCREEN SHOWING A PICTURE OF THE THREE
CHAPTERS IN ACTION.  EACH PLAYER MUST CLICK ON ONE OF THE PICTURES, AND THE
APPROPRIATE DOOR WILL CLOSE.  WHEN EACH PLAYER HAS DONE THIS, THIS LAST
PLAYER SHOULD CLICK ON THE DOUBLE ARROW IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER,
WHICH WILL RETURN THEM TO THE MAIN OPTION SCREEN, WHERE A NEW `START MISSION`
ICON WILL HAVE APPEARED.  CLICK ON THIS TO BEGIN THE FIRST MISSION.


THE IMPERIUM


MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLENIA AGO, MANKIND TOOK THE FIRST TENTATIVE STEPS TO
THE STARS.  WITH THE DISCOVERY OF THE WARP DRIVE CAME THE GREAT EXPANSION.
WHAT WAS ONCE A JOURNEY OF SEVERAL CENTURIES BECAME A JOURNEY OF SEVERAL
DAYS.


WARP SPACE


WARP SPACE IS THE PARALLEL UNIVERSE THROUGH WHICH STARSHIPS MAY JUMP,
TRAVELLING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIGHT YEARS IN A FEW HOURS.  WARP SPACE
IS ALSO THE DOMAIN OF CHAOS.  IN WARP SPACE, NOTHING MAY BE TAKEN FOR
GRANTED.  IT IS A UNIVERSE FILLED WITH CROSS-CURRENTS, EDDIES AND WHIRLPOOLS
OF POWER.  SHIPS HAVE DISAPPEARED WITHOUT REASON, AND EMERGED FROM THE WARP
CENTURIES AFTER THEY ENTERED IT, MILLIONS OF LIGHT YEARS FROM THEIR
DESTINATION.  THESE DERELICT STARSHIPS, DISTORTED BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION, ARE
KNOWN AS SPACE HULKS.


THE AGE OF STRIFE


DURING THE GREAT EXPANSION, MAN REACHED EVER FURTHER INTO THE STARS.  IN TIME
THE HIDDEN POWER OF THE WARP CAME TO BE NOTICED.  BY ENTERING WARP SPACE MAN
HAD AWOKEN AN ANCIENT EVIL:  THE MINIONS OF CHAOS HAD ESCAPED THE WARP.  THE
FIRST GREAT WAR, KNOWN AS AGE OF STRIFE, HAD BEGUN.

FOR MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND YEAR, WARFARE WRACKED MANKIND, NATION BATTLED
WITH NATION, PLANET FOUGHT PLANET, SYSTEM DESTROYED SYSTEM.  ABANDONED
COLONIES PERISHED BY THE SCORES WHILST ALIENS PLUNDERED AND GREW FAT ON THE
WRECK OF HUMANITY.  THEN CAME A SAVIOR.  THE AGE OF STRIFE, ARGUABLY THE
GREATEST TIME OF PERIL MANNERS EVER FACED, BOUGHT FORTH THE GREATEST MAN
HISTORY HAS RECORDED - THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KNOWN AS THE EMPEROR OF HUMAN
SPACE.  A SHREWD DIPLOMAT, HE GATHERED THE FRAGMENTS OF HUMAN SOCIETY AND
FORMED THEM INTO THE EMPIRE.  A BRILLIANT SOLDIER, HE CONQUERED AND RECLAIMED
THE WORLDS LOST TO CHAOS.  FOR THIS TASK HE CREATED THE SPACE MARINES, THE
GREATEST WARRIORS OF ALL.

THE LEGIONS ASARTES IS THE OFFICIAL TITLE OF THE WARRIOR ORGANIZATION KNOWN
AS THE SPACE MARINES.  ITS WARRIORS ARE ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE MOST POWERFUL AND
FEARED FIGHTING MEN IN THE IMPERIUM.

IN NUMERICAL TERMS THE SPACE MARINES ARE A SMALL FORCE, BUT THEIR SUPER HUMAN
ABILITY AND FEARSOME REPUTATION MAKE THEM WORTH MANY TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER
IN CONVENTIONAL TROOPS.  THEY ARE HELD IN AWE THROUGHOUT THE EMPIRE.

SPACE MARINES ARE ORGANIZED INTO SELF-CONTAINED CHAPTERS, EACH WITH ITS OWN
FLEET.  A CHAPTERS FLEET PROVIDES ACCOMMODATION, TRAINING FACILITIES,
MACHINES SHOPS, ARMORIES, SHUTTLE SILOS AND EVERY OTHER FACILITY THE CHAPTER
REQUIRES.  THE FLEET ROAMS THROUGH THE GALAXY IN PURSUIT OF THE ENEMIES OF
MANKIND.  TASK FORCES BREAK AWAY FROM IT FOR INDIVIDUAL MISSIONS OR
CAMPAIGNS, AND REJOIN THE FLEET WHEN THEIR MISSION IS ACCOMPLISHED.


SPACE MARINE EQUIPMENT


SPACE MARINES HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL RANGE OF IMPERIAL WEAPONRY AND
EQUIPMENT.  THE DISTINCTIVE SPACE MARINE POWERED ARMOR PROTECTS THEM IN ALL
ENVIRONMENTS AND IS CAPABLE OF WITHSTANDING DIRECT HITS FROM ALL BUT THE MOST
POWERFUL WEAPONS.  THE STANDARD SPACE MARINE WEAPON IS THE BOLT GUN OR THE
BOLTER.  THIS IS A DEVASTATING WEAPON, WHICH FIRES A HAIL OF SMALL-CALIBRE
EXPLOSIVE SHELLS.  THE MAIN CLOSE-ASSAULT WEAPON IS THE BOLT PISTOL.  A
SMALLER VERSION OF THE BOLTER THAT BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE IS IDEAL FOR
HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING.  THE SPACE MARINES ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF VERY HEAVY
WEAPONS THAT MAY BE EMPLOYED WHEN GREATER FIRE POWER IS NEEDED FOR A MISSION.


ASSAULTING SPACE HULKS


A COMMON ASSAULT PROCEDURE IS AS FOLLOWS:

1.  THE MOTHER SHIP LAUNCHES ONE OR MORE ASSAULT VESSELS TOWARDS THE ALIEN
STARSHIP.  ONCE ALONGSIDE, A NUMBER OF DOCKING CLAWS EXTEND FROM THE ASSAULT
VESSELS AND GRAB THE SIDE OF THE ALIEN SHIP.  THE POWERFUL CLAWS TEAR INTO
THE ALIEN SHIP AND PULL THE ASSAULT VESSEL INTO THE ATTACK POSITION.

2.  PROBES WHICH PIERCE THE SKIN OF THE ALIEN SHIP ARE THEN EXTENDED FROM THE
CLAWS.  EACH PROBE HAS WITHIN IT A PASSAGEWAY THROUGH WHICH THE SPACE MARINES
ATTACK.  ONCE THIS HAS PUNCTURED THE ALIENS SHIP AND BEEN MADE AIRTIGHT, THE
BLAST DOORS ARE OPENED AND THE SPACE MARINES ASSAULT THE ALIEN SHIP.

3.  THE SPACE MARINE SQUAD IS EXPECTED TO MOVE FAST AND ACCOMPLISH THE SET
MISSION.  ONCE THE MISSION HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED, THE SPACE MARINES MAKE
THEIR WAY BACK TO THE DOCKING CLAW.  WITH ALL THE SPACE MARINES BACK ON THE
ASSAULT SHIP, THE DOCKING CLAWS RELEASE THE ALIEN SHIP AND THE ASSAULT VESSEL
RETURNS TO THE MOTHER SHIP.


SPACE CRUSADE: THE GAME


SPACE CRUSADE IS A SCIENCE FICTION ROLE PLAYING GAME,  IN WHICH YOU CONTROL A
COMMANDER AND FOUR MARINES.  YOUR COMMANDER STARTS OFF AS A SERGEANT, AND CAN
WORK HIS WAY THROUGH THE RANKS.  THE COMPUTER VERSION ALLOWS FOR THREE
PLAYERS, EACH COMMANDING ONE MARINE CHAPTER EACH.  THE ALIEN IS `PLAYED` BY
THE COMPUTER.


IF YOU DO WELL YOU WILL BE PROMPTED UNTIL YOU REACH THE EXALTED RANK OF
CAPTAIN SENIORIS, OR IF YOU MANAGE TO ACCOMPLISH EACH OF THE PRIMARY
MISSIONS,  YOU WILL BECOME CAPTAIN SUPREMUS.  (SOME OF THE TERMS BEING USED
HERE WILL SEEM A LITTLE DAUNTING AT FIRST.  DON`T WORRY EVERYTHING IS
EXPLAINED IN DETAIL OVER THE NEXT FEW PAGES.)


YOU WILL ALSO BE AWARDED HONOR BADGES IF YOU DO WELL IN A GAME.  THE SIX
MARINE RANKS ARE SHOWN ON THE MARINE RANK SECTION FOLLOWING.


THE RULES OF PLAY


THE BEST WAY TO EXPLAIN HOW TO PLAY SPACE CRUSADE IS TO EXPLAIN THE RULES OF
THE BOARD GAME, AND THEN INDICATE HOW THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED ON YOUR COMPUTER.
THE GAME IS FOR ONE TO THREE PLAYERS.  THE PLAYERS CONTROL THREE MARINE
COMMANDERS AND THEIR SPACE MARINES.  THESE PLAYERS ARE CALLED THE MARINE
PLAYERS.  THE COMPUTER PLAYS THE ALIEN.  EACH GAME IS A MISSION,  AND DETAILS
OF ALL THE MISSIONS APPEAR AT THE END OF THIS MANUAL.  PUT AS SIMPLY AS
POSSIBLE,  THE GAME GOES AS FOLLOWS:


AT THE START OF A GAME,  THE MARINE PLAYERS CHOOSE THE MARINE CHAPTER THEY
WISH TO REPRESENT,  THE WEAPONS FOR THEIR MARINE TEAM,  THE MISSION TO BE
PLAYED AND THE EQUIPMENT PACKS AND ORDERS FOR THEIR MARINE TEAM.  THE MARINE
PLAYERS TAKE THEIR TURN FIRST,  AFTER EACH MARINE TEAM THAT ARE IN PLAY HAVE
HAD THEIR TURN THEN THE ALIEN TAKES ITS TURN.  THE MARINE PLAYERS MUST
ATTEMPT TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION THEY HAVE SELECTED FROM THE MISSION LIST.
 DURING THEIR TURN,  EACH MARINE MAY MOVE,  FIRE OR FIGHT USING HAND TO HAND
COMBAT.  AS THE MARINES EXPLORE THE GAME MAP,  THEY WILL OBVIOUSLY ENCOUNTER
ALIENS.  MARINE PLAYERS SCORE POINTS FOR ELIMINATING THEIR OPPONENTS,  AND
THE PLAYER WHO SCORES THE MOST POINTS WINS THE GAME.  THAT`S IT MOVE IN ,
 KILL ALIENS,  ACHIEVE MISSION OBJECTIVES,  MOVE OUT.


THE MISSIONS


THE MARINE PLAYERS CHOOSE ONE OF THE MISSIONS FROM THE MISSION LIST AND READ
THE MISSION BRIEF TEXT WHICH EXPLAINS THE MISSION OBJECTIVES.


INCREASING IN RANK AND GAINING AWARDS


THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST POINTS,  AT THE END OF EACH MISSION, WINS,  PROVIDED
THAT THE MINIMUM POINT THRESHOLD HAS BEEN REACHED BY THAT PLAYER.  THE PLAYER
WHO WON THE GAME MOVES UP A RANK BY ONE LEVEL AND PLAYERS WHO HAVE SCORED
SUFFICIENT POINTS WILL RECEIVE AWARDS.  IF NONE OF THE PLAYERS HAVE REACHED
THE HIGHEST RANK,  ANOTHER MISSION WILL NEED TO BE PLAYED.


A PLAYER MAY TRADE IN FOUR HONOR BADGES TO MOVE UP ONE RANK.  THE AWARDS ARE
LOST,  BUT THE PLAYER MOVES UP ONE RANK.  AWARDS MAY NOT BE USED TO REACH THE
RANK OF CAPTAIN SENIORIS - YOU CAN ONLY REACH THIS RANK BY WINNING A GAME.
AWARDS MAY NOT BE USED TO REACH THE RANK OF CAPTAIN SUPREMUS - YOU CAN ONLY
REACH THIS RANK IF YOU ARE ALREADY CAPTAIN SENIORIS,  AND THEN BY
ACCOMPLISHING ALL OF THE PRIMARY MISSIONS.


BETWEEN GAMES ANY CASUALTIES THAT WERE LOST ARE REPLACED SO THAT YOU START
EACH NEW GAME WITH A FULL SET OF MARINES.  THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS IS THE
MARINE COMMANDER.  IF A MARINE COMMANDER IS ELIMINATED THEN THAT PLAYER MUST
START OFF WITH A SERGEANT IN THE NEXT GAME,  AND ANY HONOR BADGES THAT THE
PLAYER HAD ARE LOST.  MARINE COMMANDERS OF ANY RANK START EACH LEVEL WITH SIX
LIFE POINTS.


THE CAMPAIGN GAME


THE CAMPAIGN LINKS ALL TWELVE GAMES THAT YOU HAVE PLAYED TOGETHER.  THE
OBJECT OF THE CAMPAIGN IS TO BE THE FIRST PLAYER TO REACH THE RANK OF CAPTAIN
SENIORIS, OR EVEN BETTER,  TO ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THE PRIMARY MISSIONS TO
BECOME CAPTAIN SUPREMUS,  BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY REACHED CAPTAIN
SENIORIS.


IN THE FIRST GAME YOU PLAY IN A CAMPAIGN YOU WILL CHOOSE YOUR ROLES AS
NORMAL.  YOU MUST THEN PLAY THE SAME ROLE FOR THE REST OF THE GAMES UNTIL ONE
PLAYER HAS WON THE CAMPAIGN GAME.  THEREFORE,  A PLAYER WHO CHOOSES TO BE THE
ULTRA MARINES WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY THE ULTRA MARINES UNTIL THE CAMPAIGN HAS
BEEN FINISHED.  THE GAMES NEED NOT BE PLAYED ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  YOU MAY
CHOOSE TO PLAY THE GAMES OVER A NUMBER OF DAYS OR EVEN WEEKS.  AT THE END OF
EACH GAME THAT IS PLAYED THE PLAYERS MAY BE PROMOTED OR RECEIVE HONOR BADGES
DEPENDING ON HOW WELL THEY PLAYED AND HOW MANY POINTS THEY SCORED.


IN THE CAMPAIGN GAME THE NUMBER OF EQUIPMENT PACKS AND ORDERS A MARINE PLAYER
MAY CHOOSE WILL DEPEND UPON THEIR RANK AND HOW MANY HONOR BADGES THEY HAVE
BEEN AWARDED IN PREVIOUS GAMES.  A PLAYER ALWAYS HAS FOUR EQUIPMENT PACKS AND
ONE ORDER.  FOR EACH HONOR BADGE THEY HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE PLAYER MAY TAKE
AN ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT PACK.  FOR EACH RANK HE HAS BEEN PROMOTED,  THE
PLAYER MAY TAKE AN ADDITIONAL ORDER.  A PLAYER MAY NEVER HAVE MORE THAN 8
EQUIPMENT PACKS OR 4 ORDERS.

THE MARINE PLAYERS


THE MARINE PLAYERS WHICH MARINE CHAPTER THEY ARE GOING TO PLAY WITH.  THE
MARINE PLAYERS MUST THEN CHOOSE THEIR WEAPONS,  EQUIPMENT PACKS AND ORDERS.
EACH PLAYER MUST CHOOSE FOUR OF THE EIGHT EQUIPMENT PACKS AND ONE OF THE FOUR
ORDERS AVAILABLE TO THAT CHAPTER,  ALTHOUGH THEY MAY CHOOSE MORE IF THEIR
RANK OR HONORS ALLOW.


CHOOSING WEAPONS


EACH MARINE PLAYER HAS A RANGE OF WEAPONRY TO CHOOSE FROM AT THE START OF
EACH MISSION.  THE WEAPONS CHOSEN MAY VARY FROM ONE GAME TO ANOTHER,
DEPENDING ON THE AIM OF THE MISSION.


COMMANDER`S WEAPON


THERE ARE THREE ALTERNATIVE WEAPON COMBINATIONS FOR THE MARINE COMMANDER:

1. POWER AXE AND BOLT PISTOL.
THIS GIVES HIM A GOOD HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT WEAPON WITH A LITTLE FIREPOWER.

2. POWER SWORD AND POWER GLOVE.
THIS GIVES HIM NO FIREPOWER AT ALL, BUT TWO FEARSOME HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT
WEAPONS.

3. HEAVY BOLTER.
THIS GIVES HIM BETTER FIREPOWER BUT HIS HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT ABILITY IS ONLY
AS GOOD AS A NORMAL MARINE.


MARINE`S WEAPONS


THE FOUR MARINES MAY CHOOSE FROM THE AVAILABLE WEAPONS.  ONE OF THE FOUR
MARINES MUST CARRY A HEAVY WEAPON AND ONE OTHER MUST CARRY A BOLTER.  THE
REMAINING TWO MAY CHOOSE BETWEEN CARRYING A BOLTER OR A HEAVY WEAPON.  THE
THREE HEAVY WEAPONS AVAILABLE ARE:

1. ASSAULT CANNON
A USEFUL WEAPON FOR ATTACKING SCATTERED GROUPS OF THE WEAKER ALIENS OR FOR
ATTACKING SINGLE, MORE POWERFUL ALIENS.

2. MISSILE LAUNCHER
A GOOD WEAPON FOR ATTACKING ALIENS WHO ARE CLOSELY PACKED TOGETHER OR FOR
ATTACKING MORE POWERFUL ALIENS.

3. PLASMA GUN
THE PLASMA GUN IS A VERY POWERFUL WEAPON THAT IS BEST USED IN THE CORRIDORS
WHERE IT IS EFFECTIVE AGAINST ALL MANNER OF ALIENS.


ORDER OF PLAY


THE BLOOD ANGELS WILL MOVE FIRST, FOLLOWED BY THE IMPERIAL FISTS, AND THEN
THE ULTRA MARINES.


MARINE PLAYERS TURN


DURING A MARINE PLAYER`S TURN THEY MAY MOVE AND/OR FIRE (OR ENGAGE IN HAND TO
HAND COMBAT) ALL OF THEIR MARINES.  THEY MAY MOVE AND FIRE EACH MARINE IN
TURN.  A MARINE MAY MOVE FIRST, THEN FIRE, OR FIRE FIRST AND THEN MOVE.  A
MARINE DOES NOT HAVE TO FIRE OR MOVE.  HOWEVER, A MARINE MAY NOT MOVE TWICE
OR FIRE TWICE UNLESS AN ORDER IS PLAYED THAT ALLOWS THE MARINE PLAYER TO DO
SO.  THE MARINE PLAYER MAY USE ANY OF THEIR EQUIPMENT PACKS DURING THE COURSE
OF THEIR TURN.  HOWEVER, MARINE PLAYERS MAY ONLY USE ONE ORDER PER TURN.  THE
ORDER IS PLAYED AT THE BEGINNING OF A MARINE PLAYER`S TURN BEFORE MOVING OR
FIRING, AND CANNOT BE PLAYED AGAIN FOR THE DURATION OF THAT GAME.


1.MOVEMENT


THE GAME MAP IS DIVIDED INTO SQUARES WHICH ARE USED FOR MOVEMENT.  SQUARES
ARE EITHER CORRIDOR OR ROOM SQUARES.  A COMMANDER AND ANY MARINE WITH A
BOLTER MAY MOVE UP TO SIX SQUARES, AND MARINES WITH HEAVY WEAPONS MAY ONLY
MOVE UP TO FOUR SQUARES, ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE EQUIPMENT PACKS WILL ALLOW A
CHAPTER TO MOVE SIX.  A MARINE MAY BE MOVED IN ANY DIRECTION, HORIZONTALLY,
VERTICALLY, OR DIAGONALLY.  THE PLAYER MAY ALWAYS CHOOSE TO MOVE A MARINE
LESS THAN THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE ALLOWED, OR NOT TO MOVE A MARINE AT ALL.


WHEN MOVING, YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO FINISH YOUR MOVE ON AN OCCUPIED
SQUARE.  YOU MAY, HOWEVER, PASS THROUGH A SQUARE OCCUPIED BY ONE OF YOUR OWN
MARINES PROVIDED YOU HAVE ENOUGH MOVEMENT TO MOVE BEYOND THE SQUARE.  YOU MAY
NOT MOVE THROUGH A SQUARE OCCUPIED BY AN ALIEN OR A MARINE FROM ANOTHER
MARINE CHAPTER, OTHERWISE YOU MUST TAKE ANOTHER ROUTE OR STOP.


2.OPENING DOORS


ALIENS AND MARINES MAY ONLY ENTER AND LEAVE ROOMS THROUGH OPEN DOORS.  A DOOR
MAY BE OPENED BY MOVING A MARINE ONTO ONE OF THE SQUARES IN FRONT OF IT,
CLICKING ON THE DOOR ICON IN THE CONTROL PANEL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.
 PLAYERS DO NOT HAVE TO OPEN A DOOR IF THEY DO NOT WISH TO.  OPENING A DOOR
DOES NOT COUNT AS A MOVE.  PLAYERS MAY NOT CLOSE DOORS OR OPEN DOORS THEY ARE
NOT ADJACENT TO, UNLESS AN ALIEN EVENT (SEE ALIEN EVENTS) HAS OCCURRED AND
ALLOWS THEM TO DO SO.  A DOOR WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY IF A PLAYER MOVES ON,
OR PAST IT.


3.SCANNING


ANY OF THE MARINES IN YOUR TEAM MAY SCAN FOR ALIENS DURING THEIR TURN, BUT
ONLY ONE SCAN IS ALLOWED PER TURN.  IF THERE ARE ALIENS WITHIN SCAN RANGE
THEN BLIPS, WHICH ARE UNREVEALED ALIENS, WILL APPEAR.  BLIPS WILL ONLY APPEAR
IF THEY ARE NOT WITHIN A MARINE`S LINE OF SIGHT.  OBVIOUSLY, ANY ALIENS
WITHIN THE SIGHT OF A MARINE WILL BE SHOWN AS AN ALIEN, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
YOU HAVE SCANNED OR NOT.  IF A MARINE MOVES ONTO A SQUARE FROM WHICH LINE OF
SIGHT CAN BE TRACED TO ONE OR MORE BLIPS, THEN THOSE BLIPS WILL BE REVEALED
AND AN ALIEN WILL APPEAR IN PLACE OF THE BLIP.


BLIPS


IF A MARINE OR COMMANDER MOVES ONTO A SQUARE FROM WHICH A LINE OF SIGHT CAN
BE TRACED TO ONE OR MORE BLIPS, THEN THOSE BLIPS WILL BE REVEALED.


LINE OF SIGHT


LINE OF SIGHT BETWEEN MARINES OR ALIENS IS CALCULATED BY TRACING A STRAIGHT
LINE FROM THE CENTER OF ONE SQUARE TO THE OTHER.  IF THE LINE OF SIGHT PASSES
THROUGH A SQUARE CONTAINING A MARINE OR ALIEN, A CLOSED DOOR OR A WALL, THE
LINE OF SIGHT IS BLOCKED.  ALIENS OR MARINES ONLY BLOCK THE LINE OF SIGHT FOR
FIRING, THEY DO NOT BLOCK THE LINE OF SIGHT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING IF A
BLIP NEEDS TO BE REVEALED.  OBVIOUSLY, ON THE COMPUTER THIS IS CALCULATED
AUTOMATICALLY.


FIRING


YOU MAY ONLY FIRE AT TARGETS THAT ARE VISABLE AND CANNOT FIRE AT BLIPS.
 TARGETS ARE VISABLE IF YOU CAN TRACE A LINE OF SIGHT TO THEM.  THERE IS NO
MAXIMUM RANGE FOR ANY OF THE WEAPONS USED IN SPACE CRUSADE.  THE DICE ROLLED
WILL DEPEND UPON WHICH WEAPON YOU ARE USING.


   LIGHT WEAPONS
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   BOLTER OR BOLT PISTOL          2 LIGHT WEAPONS DICE

   HEAVY BOLTER                   2 HEAVY WEAPONS DICE


   HEAVY WEAPONS
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   ASSAULT CANNON                 2 HEAVY WEAPONS DICE

   PLASMA GUN                     2 HEAVY WEAPONS DICE

   MISSILE LAUNCHER               2 HEAVY WEAPONS DICE


OBVIOUSLY, IN THE COMPUTER VERSION THE APPROPRIATE DICE WILL BE CHOSEN FOR
YOU.


ROLLING TO HIT


WHEN FIRING, THE APPROPRIATE DICE FOR THE WEAPON BEING FIRED ARE ROLLED.  IF
THE TOTAL IS GREATER THAN THE ARMOR VALUE OF YOUR TARGET THEN YOU WILL HAVE
SCORED A HIT.  THE TARGET MUST THEN LOSE ONE LIFE POINT FOR EACH POINT YOU
ROLLED OVER ITS ARMOR VALUE.


ALL ALIENS, EXCEPT THE DREADNOUGHT, HAVE ONLY ONE LIFE POINT AND THERE ARE
THEREFORE ELIMINATED WHEN THEY ARE HIT.  MARINE`S ALSO HAVE ONE LIFE POINT.
 MARINE COMMANDERS START THE GAME WITH SIX LIFE POINTS.  POINTS ARE SCORED
WHEN A RIVAL MARINE OR ALIEN ARE ELIMINATED.


RE-ROLLING DICE


HAVING ROLLED THE COMBAT DICE, SOME EQUIPMENT PACKS ALLOW YOU TO RE-ROLL ONE
DICE.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO RE-ROLL A DICE, BUT IF YOU DO THEN THE NEW ROLL
WILL BE USED.  CLICK ON THE DICE YOU WISH TO RE-ROLL OR CLICK ON THE CANCEL
BUTTON BELOW THE DICE IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO RE-ROLL.


HEAVY WEAPONS


THERE ARE THREE HEAVY WEAPONS IN THE GAME AND EACH HAS A SPECIAL WAY OF
FIRING.  ALL HEAVY WEAPONS AFFECT AN AREA, AND THEREFORE MAY HIT MORE THAN
ONE TARGET.


ASSAULT CANNON


WHEN USING THE ASSAULT CANNON THE TOTAL NUMBER ROLLED MAY BE SPLIT BETWEEN
ANY VISABLE TARGETS.  ELIMINATING A MARINE OR ALIEN MAY MAKE OTHER VISABLE
TARGETS.  THESE WILL THEN BE ELIMINATED PROVIDED YOU HAVE SCORED ENOUGH
POINTS.


PLASMA GUN


THE PLASMA GUN FIRES ALL MARINES OR ALIENS IN A STRAIGHT LINE OF SQUARES,
WHICH MAY BE VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL, OR DIAGONAL.  THE TOTAL NUMBER ROLLED IS
COMPARED TO THE ARMOR VALUE OF EACH AND EVERY MARINE OR ALIEN IN THE LINE OF
FIRE.  THE LINE OF FIRE WILL BE BLOCKED AS SOON AS IT HITS A WALL OR A CLOSED
DOOR.


MISSILE LAUNCHER


THE MISSILE LAUNCHER MUST FIRE AT A SQUARE, RATHER THAN AT A SPECIFIC MARINE
OR ALIEN, ALTHOUGH THE TARGET SQUARE MAY CONTAIN AN ALIEN OR MARINE.  ANY
ALIEN OR MARINE IN THE TARGET SQUARE WILL BE ATTACKED WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER
ROLLED ON BOTH DICE.  FURTHERMORE, ANY MARINE OR ALIEN IN AN ADJACENT SQUARE
WILL BE CAUGHT IN THE BLAST AND IS ATTACKED WITH THE HIGHER OF THE TWO DICE
ROLLED.  THE BLAST WILL NOT AFFECT MARINES OR ALIENS ON THE FAR SIDE OF A
WALL OR CLOSED DOOR.


HAND TO HAND COMBAT


INSTEAD OF FIRING, A MARINE OR ALIEN MAY ATTACK USING HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.  A
MARINE OR ALIEN MAY ATTACK USING HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT BEFORE OR AFTER MOVING.
 TO ATTACK A MARINE OR ALIEN IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT YOU MUST BE IN ONE OF
FOUR SQUARES TO THE SIDE, FRONT OR REAR.  YOU CANNOT ATTACK DIAGONALLY UNLESS
YOUR MARINE TEAM CARRIES AN EQUIPMENT PACK THAT ALLOWS THEN TO DO SO.


THE HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT DICE ARE ROLLED AND THE POINTS OF THE TWO OPPONENTS
ARE COMPARED.  WHOEVER ROLLED THE MOST WINS.  THE LOSER MUST LOSE ONE LIFE
POINT FOR EACH POINT HIS OPPONENT ROLLED ABOVE THEIR OWN TOTAL.  THEREFORE IF
ONE PLAYER ROLLED ONE AND THEIR OPPONENT ROLLED FOUR, HE WOULD LOSE THREE
LIFE POINTS.  IF BOTH ROLL THE SAME SCORE THEN IT IS A DRAW AND NEITHER OF
THEM LOSES ANY LIFE POINTS.  IN HAND TO HAND COMBAT, THE STRENGTH OF ANY
ARMOR IS NOT CONSIDERED.


THE ALIEN`S TURN


DURING THE ALIEN`S TURN THEY MAY MOVE AND/OR ATTACK.  AN ALIEN EVENT TAKES
PLACE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE ALIEN`S TURN.  ONCE THEY HAVE MOVED/ATTACKED
THEN THE ALIEN`S TURN IS OVER.


ALIENS ATTACKING


EACH ALIEN, EXCEPT THE DREADNOUGHT, MAY MAKE ONE ATTACK PER TURN.  THE ATTACK
MAY BE MADE BEFORE OR AFTER THE ALIEN MOVES.  ALIENS ATTACK EITHER BY FIRING
OR HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.  SOME ALIENS HAVE HEAVY WEAPONS.  SOME OF THE CHAOS
MARINES MAY HAVE HEAVY WEAPONS AND THE DREADNOUGHT MAY BE ARMED WITH TWO.
 THESE HEAVY WEAPONS FIRE IN THE SAME WAY AS HEAVY WEAPONS CARRIED BY
MARINES.  ALIENS MAY NOT FIRE THEIR WEAPONS AND ATTACK IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT
IN THE SAME TURN.


ELIMINATING MARINES


MARINE PLAYERS LOSE POINTS FOR EACH MARINE ELIMINATED, MORE POINTS FOR EACH
MARINE WITH A HEAVY WEAPON ELIMINATED OR IF THEIR MARINE COMMANDER IS
ELIMINATED.  MARINE PLAYERS CONTINUE TO PLAY NORMALLY, EVEN IF THEIR MARINE
COMMANDER IS ELIMINATED.


THE DREADNOUGHT


THE DREADNOUGHT IS A FEARSOME WAR MACHINE, DEVELOPED BY THE ALIEN FOLLOWERS
OF CHAOS.  IT IS AN ADVERSARY TO BE FEARED AND RESPECTED.


MOVING THE DREADNOUGHT


THE DREADNOUGHT OCCUPIES FOUR SQUARES, INSTEAD OF ONE.  WHEN MOVING IT MAY
PASS THROUGH OTHER ALIEN`S BUT MAY NOT END ITS MOVE IF ANY OF THE FOUR
SQUARES IT OCCUPIES CONTAINS AN ALIEN OR MARINE.  THE DREADNOUGHT MAY ALWAYS
CHANGE THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS FACING BY TURNING ON THE SPOT.  THE
DREADNOUGHT MAY NOT MOVE DIAGONALLY.


THE DREADNOUGHT`S WEAPONS


THE DREADNOUGHT STARTS THE GAME WITH BOLTERS MOUNTED ONTO ITS BODY AND TWO
HEAVY WEAPONS.  WHEN A DREADNOUGHT FIRES IT MAY FIRE ALL THREE OF ITS
WEAPONS.  THE WEAPONS ARE FIRED ONE AT A TIME.  IT MAY FIRE MORE THAN ONE
WEAPON AT THE SAME TARGET OR MAY CHOOSE TO FIRE EACH WEAPON AT A DIFFERENT
TARGET.  THE DREADNOUGHT CAN FIRE ALL ITS WEAPONS AS LONG AS IT CAN TRACE A
LINE OF SIGHT TO ITS INTENDED TARGET FROM AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOUR SQUARES IT
OCCUPIES.  THE DREADNOUGHT MAY NOT FIRE THOSE WEAPONS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST
DURING COMBAT.  WHEN BOTH HEAVY WEAPONS HAVE BEEN LOST THEN IT MAY ONLY FIRE
WITH ITS BOLTERS.


THE DREADNOUGHT`S LIFE POINTS


THE DREADNOUGHT HAS THREE LIFE POINTS.  WHEN IT LOSES THE FIRST LIFE POINT
THEN IT WILL LOSE ONE OF ITS HEAVY WEAPONS.  THE SECOND HEAVY WEAPON IS LOST
WHEN IT LOSES ANOTHER LIFE POINT.  IT CONTINUES TO ROLL ITS FULL NUMBER OF
COMBAT DICE FOR HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT, EVEN WHEN IT IS DAMAGED.  THE
DREADNOUGHT IS DESTROYED WHEN IT LOSES ITS THIRD LIFE POINT.


ALIEN REINFORCEMENTS


THE ALIEN STARTS THE GAME WITH A NUMBER OF REINFORCEMENTS.  THE EXACT NUMBER
WILL DEPEND ON THE MISSION BEING PLAYED.  THE ALIEN MAY MOVE UP HIS
REINFORCEMENTS AT THE END OF HIS TURN.  ALIEN REINFORCEMENTS WILL NOT BE
PLACED ON A SQUARE THAT IS VISABLE TO A MARINE.  OBVIOUSLY, ALL THE ABOVE
ACTIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT BY THE COMPUTER.

COMPLETING THE MISSION


IF ONE OF THE MARINE PLAYERS SUCCEEDS IN FULFILLING THE MISSION THEY WILL BE
AWARDED THE PRIMARY MISSION, FOR WHICH YOU WILL BE AWARDED THIRTY POINTS.  A
MARINE PLAYER WHO ACCOMPLISHES THE SECONDARY MISSION WILL BE AWARDED THE
SECONDARY MISSION, AND POINTS.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON SECONDARY MISSIONS,
SEE `ALIEN EVENTS` LATER IN THIS MANUAL.


ONCE THE MISSION HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE MARINES MUST RETURN THEIR OWN
DOCKING CLAWS.  ANY MARINE ON A DOCKING CLAW IS SAFE FROM ATTACK.  ALIENS MAY
NOT MOVE ONTO A MARINE DOCKING CLAW.  ONCE A MARINE HAS RETURNED TO THE
DOCKING CLAW IT PLAYS NO FURTHER PART IN THE GAME.  A MARINE MAY NOT FIRE OR
MOVE BACK ONTO THE MAP.  IF THE MARINES FAIL TO COMPLETE THE MISSION THEY MAY
STILL RETURN TO THEIR DOCKING CLAW TO ESCAPE.


END OF THE GAME


ONCE ALL THE MARINE`S AND COMMANDERS HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR DOCKING CLAWS
THEN THE GAME ENDS.  THE GAME ENDS AUTOMATICALLY AFTER EACH REMAINING MARINE
CHAPTER HAVE TAKEN THEIR FINAL TURN.  THE MARINE PLAYERS HAVE ONE LAST TURN

ELIMINATED.


WINNING THE GAME


THE COMPUTER WILL TOTAL UP THE SCORE FOR EACH OF THE PLAYERS, AND WILL TELL
YOU WHO THE WINNER IS, PROVIDING THAT AT LEAST ONE PLAYER HAS REACHED THE
MINIMUM WINNING POINTS REQUIRED.  AGAIN, THIS NUMBER IS MISSION DEPENDANT,
BUT THIS NUMBER WILL BE GIVEN IN THE MISSION BRIEFING SCREEN.  ONCE A GAME IS
OVER, THE PLAYERS WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF SAVING THEIR CHAPTERS TO
USE IN LATER GAMES OR CAMPAIGNS.
