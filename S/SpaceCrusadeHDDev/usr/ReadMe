 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly

SAVING GAMES:

You need to go in the format menu before you can save a game.
If you format/load/save a game, nothing will happen (HD won't be accessed,
nor the floppy) but when you quit the game, the saves will be written back
to disk.
So if you saved a game, don't quit by a reset or you lose your changes.
On the contrary, if you accidentally format your games, just quit be a reset and
the games won't be erased.
