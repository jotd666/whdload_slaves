 EXTRA NOTES
 -----------
 
 This game didn't like 32bit fastram, hence why it hasn't been activated.  
 Nice enough game, that is a little speedier with caches enabled, but the way
 that the game is coded doesn't lend itself to huge ingame speed increases.

 
 
Kindest Regards, Galahad, Tony, Peter and Frank
