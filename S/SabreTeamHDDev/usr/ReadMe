 EXTRA NOTES
 -----------
 
 Don't try and load a save game, unless you have actually saved a game... 
 Logical I think!
 
 Playtested as much as I can (not my kind of game!), everything appears
 to operate as it should on 68o20-68o6o!
   
 Be patient whilst the game boots up.  I transferred the decrypter 
 routine to fastmem, but it still takes a while.
 
 Enjoy this install.
 
Kindest Regards, Galahad of Fairlight

 About AGA version: this one has been sitting on my hard drive for about 3 years
 because it crashed at the first game load. Then today I stumbled on the game
 readme which stated that you have to save the game first, or it will crash!!
 I should have read this file a bit earlier :)

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de
