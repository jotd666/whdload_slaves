rounds), surrounding the number box below the snipers gun and then pressing

Selecting zero rounds cancels the shot.

Note that before a gun can be fired it must be loaded with ammunition.

WEAPON INFORMATION

The  noise  level  when  a  gun  is  fired radiates over a certain distance
depending  on  the  weapon  type.   The  radiated  noise  distance  figure,
represents  the  number of movement spaces that the shot can be heard, from
the  position  where the team member fired his weapon.  The damage a bullet
can do decreases with the distance it has to travel.

A  100% damage distance figure, represents the number of move spaces that a
bullet could possibly do 100% damage, given an accurate shot at the target.

DIRECTIONAL CONTROL

Controls  the  direction  a player faces or moves to and indicates possible
enemy  sightings  or  suspicious noises heard.  To move a team member place
the  mouse  pointer over the arrow in the direction you want to go and move
by  clicking  on  it once or hold down the left mouse button for continuous
movement.

AUDIO/VISUAL STATUS

During  a  game  turn the compass (DIRECTIONAL CONTROL) arrows may light up
either RED or BLUE.  This is a WARNING that there is someone within a close
proximity  to  that  current  team  member.   A  red highlighted arrow, but
indicates they are in visual range, in the direction indicated by the arrow
but may not yet be visible on the qame screen area shown.

A  blue  highlighted  arrow indicates a noise has been heard in the general
direction of that arrow.

OPPORTUNITY MOVE

If  enough  action  points  are saved before ending a turn, then during the
enemies  turn  an  opportunity  move  may  be  awarded  to a team member An
opportunity  move  occurs if a team member has more than five action points
and is in visual range of and can be seen by the enemy.

The  number  of  action  points  available,  determines the chance of being
awarded  an  opportunity  move.   For  example saving twenty or more action
points  gives a 100% chance decreasing to a 0% chance as less action points
are  available  During  an opportunity move, control is taken away from the
enemy  and  the team member concerned is given the chance to use all of the
action points remaining, either for weapons or moving.

Ending  the  opportunity move turn gives full control back to the enemy for
the remainder of the enemy turn.

Note that only one opportunity move may be awarded per game turn.

HEALING WOUNDED PLAYERS

Medical Kit - Any team member carrying this piece of equipment during a
mission will regain 5% of total health per game turn

healed when selected for the next mission.

required  item(s)  on  the  ground using the DROP icon, select the required
team member and then WALK over the dropped item(s), then select the PICK UP
icon and choose the items you wish to collect.

number  of action points remaining, followed by the number of action points
required  to  perform  the  currently  selected option as determined by the
mouse pointer position.

MISSION DESCRIPTIONS

MISSION 1: EMBASSY SIEGE

Terrorists's  have  taken control of the American Embassy in London and are
holding  four hostages.  Find the rooms where they are being held and guide
them  to  safety.  To rescue a hostage, move a Sabre team member to a space
directly  next  to  and  facing  that particular hostage, you will now gain
control of the hostage as if he were a member of your team.

To  successfully complete this mission either guide all the hostages out to
safety  or  kill  all of the terrorists, leaving the Metropolitan police to
collect them.

MISSION 2: JUNGLE POW CAMP

Imprisoned  within  the  prisoner  of war camp are four hostages.  Find the
cells where they are being held and guide them to safety.

Hostages are then air lifted to safety once outside the POW camp.

To  successfully  complete  this mission, guide all four hostages to safety
outside  the POW camp.  Once all hostages have been rescued, you must guide
the remaining members of your team out of the camp to safety.

MISSION 3: WAR GAMES

Four  machines  containing  missile  launch  codes,  are  located within an
underground  military base.  These machines must be completely destroyed by
shooting them at least three times.

To  successfully  complete  this mission, all four machines must be totally
destroyed.   Surviving  Sabre  team members must then make their way out of
the base, to be air lifted to safety.

MISSION 4: LINER HIJACK

Terrorists  have  hijacked an ocean liner and have altered its destination,
they are holding innocent passengers and crew members hostage.

To  successfully  complete this mission, all of the terrorists onboard must
be killed, thus allowing the liner to resume its original course.

The mission is automatically completed on killing the last terrorist.

MISSION 5: MISSILE GUIDANCE

Four machines used for programming missile guidance systems are held within
a missile manufacturing plant.

To  successfully  complete  this  mission all four machines must be totally
destroyed  (as  in mission 3).  Surviving Sabre team members must then make
their way out of the base, to be air lifted to safety.

MISSION NOTE

If  all Sabre team membes are killed within a mission, then that mission is
deemed  failed  unless  however  all  mission  objectives have already been
successfully  achieved  and  one team member is available to participate in
the  next  mission.   Hostages cannot be collected or controlled, during an
opportunity move.
