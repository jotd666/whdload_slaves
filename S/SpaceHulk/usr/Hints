                           =====================

GENERAL TIPS
------------
Naturally the first  thing you want to do is master the tutorials.I know it
might  sound  obvious  to  point  this  out but you`d be surprised how many
people  make  things  too  hard  for themselves by skipping  this extremely
useful training peroid.Repeat the first three as amny times as it takes for
the  controls to become second nature.Learn every single move availbale and
use them all - this will make things alot easier when you go into battle.

The  final  two  basic  tutorials are there to help you perfect your combat
tactics,In  the  last,make  sure  that  you  have Terminators covering each
other.Working  out  the best ways to do this in confined spaces is a talent
that will save your bacon in numerous places later in the game.One thing to
watch  out  for  -  try  not to have Terminators in adjacent squares.If one
should get attacked you just wont have the time to react before your entire
party gets wiped out.

The  two  most  popular  weapons  in  the game are the Storm Bolter and the
Lightning  Claws.The  Storm  Bolter is the best in the Hulk that have large
open  rooms  and  long  straight corridors,but watch out for it jamming and
always  be  ready  to unkam it.Lightning Claws will tip the odds heavily in
your  favour  when  it comes to hand-to-hand combat,so use Terminators with
these to block corridors and seal off areas.

Finally,at  some  point  in  the  Hulks  you`ll come across doors which are
lighter coloured than the usual doors and have insignia all over them.These
can  only be opened and closed by Terminators,so use them to block passages
and stop Genestealers from chasing you all over the show!


ADVANCED TUTORIALS
------------------
TUTORIAL -1-
------------
You  have  to  move  quickly  on  this  mission,due  to the fact that youre
operating  on  a  time  limit.The  artifact  youre  looking  for  is in the
south-west corner of a room in the eastern side of the hulk,measuring three
squares  by  three  squares.Collect  it  and run to the exit,remembering to
close the final door yoou go through to complete the mission.

TUTORIAL -2-
------------
Place  your Terminators to cover all entrances around the starting area and
get  ready  for  some  action.Where  possible,keep  firing to stop ambushes
happening  and pray for the best.If you find yorself down to one Terminator
then  run  like  hell  to  the  rescue  zone and dont look back.If you need
to,keep  using  the  Freeze  Time  option  to  check  the  positions of the
Genestealers.

TUTORIAL -3-
------------
This  is  quite  a  simple  one  that  teaches you how to  use doors to you
advantage.On  this  particular Hulk the Genestealers cant open doors,so use
them  to keep the nasty beasties out of your way.Move in single file,if you
can,and  always control the lead Terminator.When left alone the musclebound
hereos  have a tendency to blow doors open,and once thast done they cant be
closed  again.By the way,never open a door when theres a Genestealer on the
other  side - they can be through the gap and at your throat before you can
even draw your gun.

TUTORIAL -4-
------------
This  one  is  all  aboout  position, so heres how you should position your
posse.Leave  the dude with the Heavy Flamer covering the starting point,and
then  get  the  guys  with the Storm Bolters to cover any entry points.Stay
alert  and be ready to jump in at the first sign of trouble.If you lose one
Terminator this is going to be really hard to complete!

TUTORIAL -5-
------------
In this tutorial your main concern should be to get the Heavy Flamer to the
target  and  you  may  need  to sacrifice Terminators to get him there.This
doesnt  matter  -  just  keep youre eye out for an opening and move quickly
when you find it.Just get going,alright?

TUTORIAL -6-
------------
If you cant figure this one out by now then you  must be a thicky.Place two
Terminators   on   opposite   sides  of  the  corridors  leading  from  the
Genebanks,keeping  the  last one out of the way as a reserve.Now just blast
like mad until your objective is reached.

TUTORIAL -7-
------------
If  you  arnt  aware  of how many problems the Flamer can cause,this is the
mission  that  shows you.If yoou can really avoid it dont flame in the main
corridor,as  this  will slow doown your foward progress a hell of a lot.Try
to lead the Genestealers into the side corridor before blowing them away.As
in  Tutorial  5,your  real  concern  is  to  get  at leat one Flamer to the
target,so  do  whatever  is necessary.Dont worry about their families - the
success is all that counts.

TUTORIAL -8-
------------
To  free  the trapped squad you`ll need to use your Assault Cannons to blow
open  the  area.When  you  have  freed the squad then you can use the Storm
Bolter to escort the Heavy Flamer back to the targeet area on the west side
of  the  map.Flame the area and then go along the  southern corridor to get
to the east target.The door in the middle of the corridor cant be opened by
the Genestealers,so use it in any way you can to lighten your load.

TUTORIAL -9-
------------
The  final  advanced  tutorial.Funnily  enough,I  can  explain it away in a
couple  of  short  sentances.Place  Storm  Bolters  at  the ends of the two
corridors  running  both  north  and south and then keep your finger on the
fire button.Easy or what?


SINGLE SQUAD
------------

MISSIONS
--------
If,by  this  point,you are wondering quite why the mission descriptions are
so  short,let  me  explain  one  thing:  there is no guaranteed way to do a
mission.All  we  are aiming to do here is give you some tactical advice and
perhaps make things a little easier for you.Okay?

PURIFY
------
The  most  important  thing  to  remember in this mission is to protect the
Flamers.The  first two rooms you need to falme are easy enough to reach but
you  might have a little trouble getting to the two final rooms.The easiest
way  to  get  to  them  is  to place a Storm Bolter in front of each of the
Flamers  and  then  lead  the way to the target.Doing it this way will mean
youll have to loose two Storm Bolters but who care?

BLOCKADE
--------
A  simple  one  in  theory, but a little harder than it sounds in practice.
Leave  the  Heavy Flamer behind at the start and use him to cover the lower
corridor.The  Terminators you have left should be used to cover and protect
the  one  carrying  the  CAT  until  all  the  way to the exit point.  Once
there,just close the door to end the mission.

STRANDED
--------
In this mission you need to move fast,but if you can get into position fast
enough  it  shouldnt  be  too tough.Use the four Storm Bolters to cover the
Genestealers  entry  points  and  then  run  with  the  Heavy Flamer to the
target.The Storm Bolters will be defeated but this will take a little time,
which you should use to race to your objective.

LOST SCROLLS
------------
The  most  difficult  thing  about  this  mission  is  finding  the scrolls
themselves,  so  we`ll  tell  you  where  they  are  to  stop  you  sending
Terminators  into  unnecessary  danger.In  the  centre of the map are three
clustered rooms.In the north-west corner of the north-east room you`ll find
the  first  scroll.The  second  is  in  the corridor south of the noth-west
room.The third scroll is against the east wall in the south end of the wide
corridor  that  runs down the westside of the level.You can do this mission
with  five  storm bolters,but if you should lose any youre going to find it
your work cut out.

ADVANCE
-------
If  yoou  examine the map at the start of this mission youll see that there
are  only  ten  Genestealers  on  this  Hulk  and there are no genebanks to
generate  more.So,instead  of rushinginto danger,move to the best defensive
points  near the starting location and wait for the Genestealers to come at
you.   Once  youve  blown  them all away you can head for the Heavy Flamers
target room,which is in the south central area of the hulk.

SWARM
-----
Cover  your  rear!   This  is about the only helpful thing that can be said
about  this  mission.The exit room only has room for one Terminator,so dont
worry  too  much about using the rest of the squad to lure the Genestealers
away.Just move quickly and pray!


TWO SQUAD MISSION
-----------------
CLEANSE
-------
You  know what you have to do,so heres how to do it.Use the long corridiors
whenever  possible,so  that  you can use the Storm Bolters to their biggest
advantage.Keep  your  bolters  spread out by at least thre or four squares,
and try to keep two Storm Bolters to each Heavy Flamer.If you can gget away
with  only  one moving one Flamer around then all the better,as this leaves
the others in reserve.

FIGHT TO THE DEATH
------------------
Move  Terminators Five and Ten to the rear of the two entry points.Now move
the  remaining  gang  into  the  corridors  surrounding  the core and start
blasting.When  they  start  getting  killed  dont  worry,as you should only
expect  Termintors  five  and  ten  to be still standing at then end of the
mission.

COVERING FIRE
-------------
The  first thing to note is that Terminator Three is carrying the CAT unit.
This  is  a  long  mision,so  move  slowly  and  carefully.Keep a couple of
Terminators  trailing  at  the  back  to coover the rear,and make sure your
Flamers  are  among  them.Flamers  dont  automatically fire,so keep looking
around to make sure nothings coming at you.

REARGUARD
---------
The  Magus  is in the centre of the level and your Flamers target is is the
south  end  of  the  Hulk.When arming your squad make the weapons primarily
Lightning  Claws,as the small corridors of this Hulk make the Storm Bolters
useless.For a second weapon use a good close combat tool,like a Chain Fist.
To  kill  the  Magus,walk to the edge of the area being flamed and wait for
the  flames to drop.When they do,step foward and take it out with a Flamer.
Once  it  is  dead  get your Flamer to the target area and blow it away.The
Terminators  should  be  able  to  hold  off  the  Genestealers  with their
Lightning Claws.


SPACE HULK - ORIGINAL MISSIONS
------------------------------

SUICIDE
-------
The  thing  about  this  mission  is  that  you only have just enough Storm
Bolters  to  cover  all the corridors. Should someone get killed then youre
going  to find the rest of the mission very hard to complete.Watch the back
of  the  Terminator carying the Heavy Flamers,as the mission ends instantly
should  he  get  killed.Yor  best  option is to move all the Terminators to
points  where  all corridors are covered before thinking about shifting the
Flamer.

EXTERMINATE
-----------
This  is  quite an easy one,if you get the positioning right.If you look at
your  map you`ll see that there are only two corridors leading to your team
so get a Storm Bolter to cover each one.Move the other two Bolters into the
back-up  positions,at  leat three of four squares behind the main guys, and
wait!

RESCUE
------
In this mission,your main priority is to keep the team witht the CAT on the
move.You`ll  find,if youre unlucky enough to get stuck in any one location,
that  the  Genestaealers  home in on you in no time at all.Try and keep the
corridors that lead to the Genebanks covered at all times,and use the Heavy
Flamers to seal off the other corridors if you think its necessary.Remember
that  the  Flamers  dont  fire  of  their oown accord you need to fire them
yourself.

CLEANSE AND BURN
----------------
Use  a  Storm  Bolter  to  block  each  of  the  two long corridors in this
Hulk,remembering  to  get  the Heavy Flamers out of the way while they move
into  position.The  other Storm Bolters in your team should cover all known
entry  points.Now  send  one  Heavy Flamer to deal with both targets,with a
Storm Bolter  to cover him if you can spare it.This way,should you lose the
Flamer,youve got another to pick up the pieces.

DECOY
-----
This  should cause you no problems at all,and if you cant work it out using
standard  procedure,then youre some kind on dummy.With careful positioning,
a  handful  of  Storm  Bolters  will be able to cover the Genestealer entry
points,while the remainder head off to the rescue areas.Simple as that.

DEFEND
------
Again,another  simple  one.Leave  a  Storm Bolter and a Heavy Flmaer at the
ducting  to  cover  it  should any Genestealers manage to break through,and
just  arrange  the rest of your squad to cover all Genestealer entry points
and corridors leading to the ducting.
 

Well,that  should  keep  you  occupied for awhile and thats all I feel like
typing  so  Good Luck!  Keep a look out for for handy players guides to the
best games out!
