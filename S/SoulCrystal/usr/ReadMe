 Features:
 ---------
 The game is designed for joypad use only. To make it playable with a joystick
 too, a joypad emulation via the keyboard has been implemented. The default
 joypad to keyboard assignment is as follows:
	Blue - Stop		- F1
	Green - Shuffle		- F2
	Yellow - Repeat		- F3
	Grey - Play/Pause	- F4
	Left Ear - Reverse	- F5
	Right Ear - Forward	- F6
 You can change the keys using the Custom tooltype. The template for the string
 is "Blue/K,Green/K,Yellow/K,Grey/K,LeftEar/K,RightEar/K,Force/S".
 Example to set Grey button to Space and Blue to Del:
	Custom=grey $40 blue $46 force
 To get lowlevel.library detect a joystick you must move the stick right/left
 or up/down a few times. After this the emulation will start to work.
 You can also add/use the option Force to the Custom tooltype to disable the
 auto sensing of the lowlevel.library and to force it to assume a joystick is
 connected.
