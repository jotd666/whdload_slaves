Here's what I could figure out so far about this unreleased game

Fire your weapon to freeze the nasties. Then you can push the nasties over the edge.
If you push the nasty over another nasty you get bonus & a key.

Jumping on a nasty doesn't kill it but makes it drop by one platform.

After a while nasties change color from green to brown and are more aggressive. When they are red
they're super aggressive. Shooting them calms them down to green.

5 keys get you to the next level.

Keep fire pressed to get access to special items menu

- shoe: invincibility & run very fast
- earthquake: freezes all nasties
- dog: ?

You can regain specials or lives at the end of each world with special subgame parts.

In higher levels there's a worm that you can shoot and kills all nasties it encounters
(a bit like the water in Bubble Bobble), giving away a lot of keys in the process.

There are also teleports. I couldn't figure how they worked yet.

Good luck completing each of the 5 levels of all 5 worlds.

Press P to pause the game (added by me, there were no keyboard handler)
