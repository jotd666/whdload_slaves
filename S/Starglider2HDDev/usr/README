	That install applies to "Starglider 2" © 1988 Argonaut Software.


	That install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in
	the WHDLoad package.


	History:
	
	Version 2.0 (13.11.2022) done by JOTD:
	- computed relocs to be able to install into fast memory for
	  better framerate (to upgrade copy the .reloc/.unreloc files)
 	- added speed regulation (now this could run too fast)
    - moved data files to "data"
	
	Version 1.2.1 done by Wepl (24.07.2005)
	- imager fixed to work also with PAL version again

	Version 1.2 done by Wepl (11.07.2005)
	- support for another version (US release) added, thanks to
	  Garry Cardinal for media
	- now the title sound is also ripped and played in the game, this
	  was completely missing in previous version, to update from an
	  old install you have to reinstall to get the missing file
	- savedisk handling optimized, file grows now as required
	- regional lock in US version removed
	- some snoop bugs removed
	- files (except diskimage which is savedisk) can be compressed
	  using ProPack/FImp
	- manual and solution added
	- some icons added
	- source included

	all previous work by Graham

	Version 1.1 - Replaced WHDLoad imager with RawDIC imager.
	    - Removed code protection for 100%.

	Version 1.0 - Initial release.
	    - original provided by Wolfgang Unger.


	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F9 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").


	Use the CUSTOM1 tooltype to use different savegame disks.
	(i.e. CUSTOM1=7 will use diskimage seven to save games/highscores)

 
	If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
	version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
	some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
	that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
	can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
	at http://mantis.whdload.de 

    Notes:
	There are 2/3 versions around. The relocation work (long & tedious) was
	performed on the latest version (sept 1988). If you own the older version,
	the slave just applies a delta to convert to the latest version so patches
	can be reused.
	To play the old version (july 1988) you have to use the older slave.
