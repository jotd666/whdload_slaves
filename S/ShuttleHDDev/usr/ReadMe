 This install applies to "Shuttle" (c) 1991 Vektor Grafix/Virgin - 2 disks.
 Thanks to Angus Manwaring for sending the original!


 REQUIREMENTS:
 - Slave requires WHDLoad V17+.
 - Game requires 0.5Mb chip mem and 0.5Mb other mem 
   (+1.4Mb other memory for preload option)

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 
 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de 
 
 Version 1.0 (17.05.2022) done by JOTD:
 - using fastmemory for much better framerate
 - fixed fastmem data block bug (by NOT using fastmem for data, grrrr)
 - slave using kickemu
 - tons of self-modifying code removed
 - cpu dependent loop removed (sound)
 
 Version 0.9 (2001) done by Codetapper:
 - Full load from HD
 - Loads and saves mission logs
 - Instructions included (typed by Viper!)
 - Icon, RomIcon, NewIcon and GlowIcon (created by me!)
 - Quit option (default key is PrtSc - one of the few spare keys!)
 
 
 Greetings to Jean-François Fabre (aka JOTD) for continually improving OSEmu which
 is (was) used heavily in this game :)

 Note from JOTD:
 
 In 2022, after I succeeded in making Psygnosis Red Zone faster, Angus asked
 me to look into this game. I saw that it only used OSEmu and chipmem so I tought: "easy".
 
 But it was NOT!
 
 First there were tons of self-modifying code that can only be fixed by constantly flushing
 the caches. Then there's this infamous memory bug that triggers sanity checks depending
 on the address of the fast memory block. I didn't find why the bug occurred, which means 
 that data is using only chipmem right now. But framerate seems to be a lot better
 (I'd say 2x more frames). So it could theorically be even better, but it seems too
 complicated to get that...
