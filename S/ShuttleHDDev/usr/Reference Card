                              Proudly Presents
the instructions to SHUTTLE
 ---------------------------
 KEYBOARD CONTROLS:

 To move around the screens, press E to scroll down, X to scroll
 up, S to scroll right, and D to scroll left.
 For those running Space Shuttle without a mouse, the above mouse
 controls can be emulated by the keyboard as follows:  to operate
 the switches, use the Shift and Home keys together to simulate the
 left mouse button, and Shift and Pg Up for the right button.  USing
 Shift together with the keypad cursor keys [2,4,6,&8] emulates
 the pointer movement.  Thus all mouse functions described above
 can be emulated by using these keys.

 MOUSE CONTROL:

 Once in the simulator, you can scroll around your chosen panels
 simply by moving the mouse:  when the pointer comes to the edge of
 the screen, the screen will scroll in that direction.
 To move the switches wither up or down, or from left to right,
 click the left mouse button for up,or left, or the right mouse
 button for down, or to move the mouse to the right.  Where a switch
 has more than 2 settings, continue to click the button in the
 required direction.

 Clicking the left and right mouse buttons simultaneously brings up
 the menu bar, while clicking them again removes it.
 Finally, when in the PANEL OVERVIEW view, clicking the right mouse
 button scrolls you round the different views, while the left button
 selects the one you are currently on.

 GAME RUNNING ICON:

 This appears whenever you are running the simulator, and denotes that
 it is in progress.  Occasionally other symbols will flash inside this
 icon:

 '/' - Time Running
 'M' - Message on Teleprinter from Ground Control - press f7 to read
 'S' - Time Skip facility is in operation
 'T' - Time Advance facility is in operation

 When you pause the game, whichever of these symbols is on the screen at
 the time will flash

 Now select NEXT MISSION from the MISSIONS menu, and you'll see the text
 for the first mission.  Select ACCEPT, if you want to accept it, and
 you'll find yourself already in the air, watching the 747, with the
 Shuttle on top, just before separation.  From here on in, you have to
 guide the Orbiter down to a safe landing.  Once this mission is
 successfully completed, you'll be able to select the next mission,
 TEST LAUNCH KENNEDY, which will allow you to go through the whole
 launch procedure.

 Before starting the mission, go back to the game Set Up option, select
 start position, then select Launch Pad, then click DONE, and you're
 ready to start the mission.  Select NEXT MISSION from the main menu,
 skip past the mission text as before, and you'll find yourself
 looking at the Orbiter sitting on the launch pad.

 Now you have 2 Options:

 1. sit and wait while it goes through proper pre-launch countdown,
    which takes 5 hours!
 2. simply set the SKIP facility(within the Windows Menu Option). This
    can also be done with the Orbiter menu within the Main Menu.  Set it
    to a time just before launch, i.e., T-30 seconds, then select
    Time Skip from the ACTIONS menu.  Next select SKIP within the
    ACTIONS menu, and it will take you to the required point.  This
    will take time, of course, but the view is worth the wait.  The
    Orbiter is now about to launch-the rest is up to you!

 GETTING STARTED

 MAIN MENU:

 Space Shuttle is controlled by 2 menu systems, the MAIN MENU, for all
 applications prior to launch, and the SIMULATOR MENU, for all in-flight
 operations.  Both menu bars appear at the top of the screen.  The MAIN
 MENU contains information that will be useful in familiarizing you with
 the Space Shuttle and its systems, and to help you choose the level of
 customizing you require, as well as Launch and Landing Sites and the
 mission details.

 1. ORBITER
    The first menu option contains 4 further sub-options:

    1. ABOUT SPACE SHUTTLE
       Gives the publishing and development credits for SPACE SHUTTLE

    2. RUNNING DEMO
       This takes you straight to the launch pad, where you're taken
       through a typical mission that demonstrates the many different
       functions and aspects of SPACE SHUTTLE.  In this demo, you'll see
       the Orbiter launch init orbit and deploy a satellite.  This demo
       lasts for about 15 minutes and allows you just to sit back and watch.
       To access this demo, first load up the game as detailed above.  To
       bypass the loading screen, hit the space bar(or click the left mouse
       button).  Now, select RUNNING DEMO from the ORBITER menu at the
      opening screen and sit back and watch the shuttle launch and deploy
       its satellite.  To quit the demo, press ESC to access the
       SIMULATOR MENU, then select MISC, and then QUIT TI MAIN MENU.  This
       will take you back to the main menu.


    3. GAME SET UP
       This feature allows you to customize the various aspects of the
       game.  This has 6 further options within it, which appear in a
       window called "SELECT WINDOW" whenever you select "GAME SETUP".
       From here, by selecting with the mouse and then clicking on the
       OPEN icon, you go to the following:

       This feature brings up another window that allows you to start
       either from VAB [Vehicle Assembly Building] ROLLOUT, i.e., right
       from the beginning, LAUNCH PAD, IN-ORBIT or LANDING.  You click
       on the required button, then remove this second window by
       clicking on the box in the top left hand corner.

       TIMER ADVANCE: Clicking on TIMER ADVANCE first brings another
       window onto the screen, in which are two options:
       ADVANCE BY - This feature allows you to move to any point in
       the simulator you want: just type in the required time.  When
       When the simulator is started, you'll see a letter "T" in the
       GAME RUNNING ICON that denotes that the simulator is now in
       TIME ADVANCE mode.  While in this mode, the simulator pauses
       until it finds the required point.  When it has done so, the
       letter "T" will disappear, and you'll be returned to normal
       real time.  The time advance will stop, however, if a message
       comes up for an in-flight operation to be carried out.

       DISPLAY RATE: This feature allows you to customize the rate at
       which the view is updated.  For instance, if you type in
       10 MINUTES, then every new frame you'll see will be points 10
       minutes apart.  Of course, these views wouldn't change at this
       speed in real time, only within the simulator.
       TIME SKIP SET: This differs form TIMER ADVANCE, above, only in
       that it simply allows you to jump to a designated point in the
       mission. Selecting this option brings up another window, in which
       a box marked 'ADVANCE TO' appears, set out in hours, minutes and
       second. Below this are two icons marked 'T+', meaning time after
       lift off, and 'T-' meaning time before lift off.

     To reach a set point in time within the mission, simply select "t-'
     or 'T+' and type in the required time. The simulator will then time
     advance until it has reached this point, skipping though time at a
     rate of approximately one minute of simulator time to one second of
     real time.

     DETAIL COMPLEXITY: This feature allows you to set the map and/or the
     shape complexities. In each case, a choice of levels is offered. The
     choice of complexities will of course effect the speed of the simulator.
     HELP LEVEL: This sets the level of communications between you and the
     computes, with the following choices:

             FULL-ON AUTO
             FIRST SIMULATION
             FIRST COMMAND
             VETERAN
             FULL MANUAL

     These help levels range from NOVICE to EXPERIENCED VETERAN with the
     most guidance offered at the FULL-ON AUTO level.

     SET TIME OF DAY: This brings up a window of the same title, inside
     which are two main boxes, each with times in hours and minutes,
     entitled 'TIME OF DAY' and 'LENGTH OF DAY'.

       TIME OF DAY allows you to set the time of day, based on Eastern
       Daylight Time, to whatever you required. This can come in useful,
       for example, if you're on the dark side of the planet trying to
       retrieve a satellite - setting the time to daylight hours in this
       instance would be extremely useful!
       LENGTH OF DAY allows you to determine how long a day within the
       simulator takes in real time. For example, setting this to one
       minute, say, means that the Earth then rotates once a minute, i.e.
       you'll see 30 seconds of light and 30 seconds of darkness every
       minute of the mission.

    4. QUIT: Enables you to exit SPACE SHUTTLE. THE SIMULATOR. note:
       pressing ESC while in the MAIN MENU also exits the program.

    2. LOG: This menu provides you with many facilities both before,
       during and after missions. If you go straight into a mission without
       creating your own log, and then use the Log Save option once in flight,
       your log will be saved out as 'Vektor Graphix Ltd"
       "LOG" contains several options which enable you to maintain a
       commander's log:

     1. NEW LOG: Enables you to enter in your name as you're given command
     of a space shuttle orbiter for the first time. After you've entered
     your name, your log is cleared and all subsequent missions will have
     their details logged.

     You can save your log on auto or manual by pressing th appropriate
     button on this panel: auto means that the log is saved automatically,
     and manual allows you to save the log at any time you want, using
     the in-flight simulator menu log save facility.
     Finally, when you insert your name in the box provided, it is always
     done in over-write mode, i.ie, whatever you type in will automatically
     type over anything that is there already.

     2. RELOAD: Enables you to reload a previously saved log from disk.
     Selecting this option brings up a window title 'SELECT LOG FILE', which
     contains a list of all previously saved logs. Beneath this are two icons

     'ABORT', which takes you back to the MAIN MENU and 'LOAD' to load an
     old log, simply select the one required from the list and then
     press 'LOAD'. This will then take you straight into the selected log. If
     a mission was in progress at the time the log was saved, the the
     mission is continued from that point.

     3.INFO: This feature gives you information about the space shuttle itself.

     with a sub-menu containing many of the orbiter's different aspects
     for further on-screen information.

     Click on the required section, and a screen of illustrations and infor-
     mation comes on screen. At the bottom of these screens are three
     icons, in the form of book pages. These allow you scroll forwards,
     backwards, and return to the MAIN MENU.

     4.SITES: This selection gives you two further options:
     LAUNCH SITES: Allows you to see the two launch sites, KENNEDY SPACE
     CENTER, or VANENBURG AIR FORCE BASE, in a short demo that zooms in
     from orbit down to the site in question. To return o the menu screen,
     simply press the ESCAPE key.

     LANDING SITES: This selection shows the two landing sites, KENNEDY SPACE
     CENTER and the primary site, EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, in th same way as
     the launch sites, by way of a short demo, which can be quit in the
     same way.

     5.MISSIONS: This feature allows you to select which mission you wish
     to perform. When you start with a new Commander, the only option
     available at the beginning is NEXT MISSION. Selecting this displays the
     mission objectives of the next full mission on the screen. Press 'ACCEPT'
     to start the mission, or 'ABORT' to cancel. During a full mission,

     Mission Control will expect you to be familiar enough with the shuttle to
     respond to their commands.

     As with all the missions in SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR the first thing
     you see after selecting this mission is a page of mission text. At the
     bottom of the page are two buttons; 'ACCEPT', which you select to
     start the mission and 'ABORT' which take you back to the MAIN MENU.These
     icons don't appear if you're re-playing a mission.
     This first training mission is entitled ALT [747] MISSION and in it
     you'll launch from the back of a 747 transport plane near the
     glideslope for an unpowered landing ad Edwards Air Force Base.
     WARNING: on this first test mission, almost all the controls are set
     for you when on Full-ON Auto. However, the LANDING GEAR isn't
     so don't forget to put it down! You will also be requested to turn on
     the Heads Up Displays.

     After completing this first mission, you'll see a screen entitled MIS-
     SION OBJECTIVES, which tells you how you fared in the mission.
     When you click on OK at this screen, you're returned to the Main menu.
     Selecting missions again either allows you to run the mission again,
     either for fun or because you just failed it, or to continue on to the
     next one.

     Once a full mission has been successfully completed, it objectives
     will be added to the Mission menu so that you can re-attempt a
     similar mission at any time in the future As you become more experi-
     enced as a commander, Mission Control will select you for more
     difficult mission.

     SIMULATOR MENU: This menu is split into six categories:

     1.ACTIONS: This menu allows you access to various primary in-flight
     commands.

     PILOT'S HUD with this feature you can turn the pilot's heads up display
     on or off without having to go to the respective panel.

     COMMANDER'S HUD does the same as the above for the commander's hud.
     TIMER ADVANCE allows you mouse access to this facility, offering two
     further sub-options:

             Advance - activates the facility according to the limits you've
             set Advance, Pause to Next Comms - activates the timer advance,
             but only as fas the next communications from Ground Control, at
             which point it resumes the normal countdown.

     TIME SKIP similar to TIMER ADVANCE, this feature gain offers two sub-     options:


           Skip - sets the pre-determined skip facility running
           (see main menu, game set up, time skip above)

           Skip, Pause - skips to the predetermined time, then pauses until
           you're ready to continue

           Turn Off Comms - does just that. But beware, this is NOT for
           turning off the teleprinter. Using this switch means that you will
           no longer get any communications from Ground Control and therefore
           means that you'll have no idea of what you're supposed to be doing.
           It also means that you cannot switch them back on again.

     REQUEST MISSION COMMS: All missions within SPACE SHUTTLE begin after T+55
     minutes. By this point, you'll have successfully launched the shuttle
     into orbit, and prepared it for the mission. NOw go to the ACTION menu
     select REQUEST MISSION COMMS, and up they'll come, telling you
     everything you need to know about the progress of the mission. If you
     select this before you're at the right point in time, the comms will
     tell you you don't need them just yet.

     REQUEST LANDING COMMS: Once your mission is complete, you'll be ready
     to return home. As with the mission comms above, go to the ACTION menu.
     select REQUEST LANDING COMMS and they will appear. As above if you
     select them before time, you'll be told politely that they're not
     quite necessary yet.

     2.PANELS: This is a quick way for you to get to the panel you want
     quickly [or to locate a particular panel if you're not sure where it is,
     of course] Under this heading is the following list of panels:

             FRONT PANEL
             AFT PANEL
             CENTER PANEL
             LEFT PANEL
             RIGHT PANEL
             OVERHEAD PANEL
             RIGHT AFT PANEL
             LOWER AFT PANEL
             OVERVIEWS PANEL

     The last of these Overviews takes you to a series of diagrammatic
     representations of the orbiter's operating stations. There are five of
     these that may be seen from the pilot's point of view. Move the cursor
     around this and you'll find that the different panels are highlighted
     as you go over them. Click on the required panel with the left mouse
     button and you'll be taken to it straight away. Use the right mouse
     button or space bar to go to the next Overview screen: Once the last on
     has been displayed, it starts again at the beginning.


     3.GO TO: This is similar to 'PANELS' above, except that GOTO offers you
     more detailed lists of the orbiter's available functions. For instance,
     pilot's instrument power, anti-skid light and so on.

     4.WINDOWS: This allows you access to all the various in-game set up
     windows available within the MAIN MENU. These are as follows:

    TIME ADV
    TIME SKIP
    TIME OF DAY

    MET - Short for MISSION ELAPSED TIMER, this brings up a window
            showing the time elapsed so far on the current mission.
            This can be moved to any desired point on the screen
            simply by clicking and holding the mouse pointer onto the
            top of the window and moving it around. To remove the MET
            simply click on the small box in the top left hand corner
            of the window.

    COMPLEXITY

    FIXED VIEWS - Brings up a window with a list of all the different
                      fixed views available - note that these are not
                      available in orbit
                      Once you have chosen a view, pressing F8 will select
                      the chosen view as the default for the F8 key for
                      the rest of your current stay within SPACE SHUTTLE

    HELP LEVEL - Help levels cannot be increased once a simulation has
                     been started. Help levels can only be reduced during
                     an ongoing simulation.

    LOG OPTIONS - Brings up a window of the same name. The 'AUTO' log
                      save time feature will allow you to set the time
                      that the log is saved, i.e. every 5 minutes, every
                      10 minutes and so on. Of course, this only applies
                      if you choose to have th log saved automatically. At
                      the bottom of the window are three buttons.
                      M - MANUAL LOG SAVE
                      A - AUTO LOG SAVE
                      OK - quits the window
                      If you wish to save any new configuration, you must
                      use the OK button - clicking the CLOSE WINDOW button
                      at the top of the box will simply abandon any
                      changes you might have made

    5. VIEWS- Gives a submenu of all the different viewpoints available.
              selecting any one of them will take you to the viewpoint.

                                REFERENCE

 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 This  section gives a description of, and any necessary background to
 each and every part and function of the Space Shuttle.  The reference
 section is split into 3 major activities, LAUNCH, ON ORBIT OPERATIONS,
 AND LANDING, with each aspect of the shuttle being covered under that
 section for which it has the most relevance.  In the case of an item being
 equally as important to more than one stage of the Shuttle's activities,
 we have given the full description and background, where applicable, in
 the first such occurance.

 SUMMARY OF PANELS:

 The controls and instrumentation of the real Space Shuttle are
 understandably complex.  SPACE SHUTTLE accurately reproduces the
 layout and functions of all of the genuine shuttle controls.

 The FLIGHT DECK is split into 2 main stations:

 The FORWARD station, at which are seated the Commander[right] and the
 Pilot[left].

 The AFT Station, from which the RMS is controlled during orbit.

 LAUNCH
 WATER SPRAY BOTTLES:

 These are located in the aft fuselage of the Orbiter, and are used to
 cool down the power unit, lube oil, and hydraulic systems during both
 the ascent and de-orbit phases.  There are 3 boilers in all, and they
 store water in a bellows-type storage tank pressurized by gasseous nitrogen.
 Along with 3 APUs and the hydraulic pumps, the water spray boilers are
 in operation 5 minutes before take-off, although the boilers are
 pre-activated 45 minutes before this.  One of these boilers is also briefly
 opened one day before de-orbit during a flight control system check out.

 BOILER N2 Supply 1/2/3 [PANEL R2] - controls the nitrogen shut off valves,
 which maintain water pressure in the boilers.

 APU Fuel/H2O QTY [PANEL F8] - allows the water quantity of each boiler to
 be displayed on the 1/2/3 METERS on the same panel.

 1/2/3 [PANEL R2] -

 i]  Operates the two boiler controllers.  When the relevant switch is at
     position A, the A Controller for that boiler is powered, and likewise
     for position B.  When at OFF, electrical power is removed from both
     controllers.

 ii] Operates the electrical heaters when in orbit to prevent water freeze
     up in orbit.  The heaters apply to the same boilers as do the power
     switches, and the access method is also the same.

 1/2/3 [PANEL R2] - enables the relevant controller selected by the
 previous switch.  When enabled, the READY signal appears on the
 corresponding APU/HYD READY TO START talkback indicator on PANEL R2, as
 long as the following has been actioned: N2 shut-off valve is opened,
 steam vent nozzle temperature is >130F, and the hydraulic fluid bypass
 valve is in the correct position with regard to the hydraulic fluid
 temperature.

 Problems - As the boilers and heaters are immediately concerned with
 the smooth running of the APU's on ascent, you must check to make
 certain that they are reading and operating correctly at all times.
 Once the pilot has initiated the pre-start sequence, he confirms that
 the water spray boilers are activated before he does anything else.  At
 T - 5 minutes the pilot starts the 3 power units by setting the APU CNTL
 switches to START/RUN and checking the hydraulic pressure gauges for an
 indication of approximately 600 - 1000 psi.  He then pressurizes the main
 pump and looks for about 3000 psi on the gauges.  All 3 hydraulic main
 pump pressures must be greater than 2800 psi by T - 4 minutes or the
 automatic launch sequence will abort the launch!  This is not
 something that the pilot can do anything about, of course, and the
 Shuttle must be returned for a complete check over.

 CRT DISPLAY SYSTEM:

 The MCDS on the Orbiter crew compartment flight deck allows onboard
 monitoring of Orbiter systems, computer software processing, and
 manual control for flight crew data and software manipulation.  The
 system is composed of 3 types of hardware: display electronic units[DEUs],
 display units that include the CRTs, and keyboard units, which together
 communicate with the GPCs over the display/keyboard data bus network.
 The MCDS provides almost immediate response to flight crew inquiries
 through displays, graphs, trajectory plots, and predictions about flight
 progress.  The crew controls the vehicle system operation through the use

 of keyboards in conjunction with the display units.
 Three keyboards are located on the flight deck: two on the left and
 right sides of the flight deck center console [PANEL C2] and one on
 the flight deck at the side aft flight station [PANEL R12].  Depending
 on crew requirements and preferences, each of the front keyboards can
 communicate with any of the front DEUs: the aft keyboard, however, is
 only wired to display on the aft DEU.

 Problems - If the CRTs go, there is little the crew can do about it.
 The likelihood of all of them going at once is extremely remote.  The
 only thing the crew can do to replace a blown CRT with one of the
 others - i.e., if one of the front CRTs went, the crew could replace
 it with the aft one.  This simulator is not, for obvious reasons, able
 to recreate this emergency.

 GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTERS [GPCs]:
 Almost all of the operations carried out by the Space Shuttle are
 controlled or overseen by the main computer system.  The DPS [Data
 Processing System] consists of 5 general purpose computers [GPCs]
 connected to the many hundreds of feedback censors and actuators
 throughout the Shuttle.  These are each made up of a Central
 Processing Unit [CPU] and an input/output processor [IOP], and each
 of the 5 do a different job.  All five are IBM Ap-101 computers, and
 contain a memory area for storing data and software.  They are
 collectively referred to as Shuttle's Main Memory, into which are
 loaded all the flight and operational informational systems.  The
 system software controls the computer systems and monitors
 communication between them.  It also supports the user interface
 modules to provide interaction with the crew.

 The application software consists of specific modules to manage
 navigation and control at various stages of the mission.  Each
 major module of operations or OPS has a number associated with it:

 OPS 1 Ascent
 OPS 2 On Orbit
 OPS 3 Reentry
 OPS 4 Orbit Operations
 OPS 6 RTLS [loaded along with OPS 1]
 OPS 8 On Orbit Checkout
 OPS 9 Computer Utilities

 Each major OPS also has a particular CRT display associated with it.

 GPC POWER ON/OFF [PANEL 06] - First of all you have to turn things on.
 These switches are guarded, as, for one, they control 600 watts of
 power each, and moreover the GPCs should not be able to be turned off
 inadvertantly.

 GPC OUTPUT [PANEL 06] - has three positions: BACKUP, NORMAL & TERMINATE.
 BACKUP is only used for the GPC containing the BFS, which stops it
 being used until needed; All switches for operating GPCs will be set at
 NORMAL, whereas the GPCs controlling systems management [i.e., on-orbit
 operations} will be positioned at TERMINATE, as they shouldn't be
 commanding anything during the flight phases.

 MODE [PANEL 06] - three positions" RUN, STBY & HALT. Normally if these
 switches are put into HALT in the RUN position, the software is precluded
 from operating. However, if the switches are put into STBY, the software
 can still not be executed, but the GPC is in a software controlled state.
 Normal practice is to go from HALT to STBY and then to RUN, and vice
 versa, as this gives the software a chance to ready and clean itself up.
 ORBITER FLIGHT COMPUTER SOFTWARE - refers to all the various software
 commands that are typed in at the relevant moment by the flight crew.
 PROBLEMS - If the main GPC fails, the shuttle has its own backup flight
 system, or BFS, which is loaded into the GPCs and the mass memory unit.
 As it's only concerned with the emergency ascent, insertion into orbit
 or de-orbit of the shuttle, it has a great deal less information stored
 although any of the GPCs could become a BFS if necessary. Remember, GPC 5
 must be switched on at the pre-launch phase, otherwise the shuttle won't
 take off.
 Other than this, however, for the purposes of SPACE SHUTTLE - THE
 SIMULATOR, the BFS won't be operable.
