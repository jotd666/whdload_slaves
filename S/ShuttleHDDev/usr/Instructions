2 HOW TO QUICK START:

THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING QUICK START GUIDE.REFERENCES ARE MADE TO A 
NUMBER OF MENUS AND WINDOWS:THIS GUIDE IS INTENDED FOR THOSE PEOPLE 
WHO WISH TO GET UP INTO SPCE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE,WITHOUT MESSING 
AROUND WITH MANUALS.FULL DOCUMENTATION OF THE VARIOUS MENUS,IN FACT 
THE USER INTERFACE AS A WHOLE,IS GIVEN LATER IN THE MANUAL.

TO GET UP INTO SPACE,IT RECOMMENEDED THAT YOU FIRST FAMILIARIZE 
YOURSELF WITH THE BASIC LAYOUT OF SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR,AND WITH
THE ESSENTIAL CONTROLS OUTLINED IN THE KEY CONTROL SECTION.YOU CAN QUICK
START WITHOUT DOING SO,BUT IT SHOULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE MORE ENJOYABLE.
HOWEVER,TO GO STRAIGHT INTO LAUNCH AND WATCH THE SHUTTLE GO INTO ORBIT:
THE QUICKEST WAY TO DO THIS IS TO USE THE RUNNING DEMO,AVAILABLE UNDER
THE MAIN MENU,ORBITER MENU.FOR MORE DETAILS OF THIS DEMO MODE,SEE
RUNNING DEMO IN THE MAIN MENU SECTION BELOW.

ONCE YOUVE SEEN ENOUGH OF THE DEMO,YOU CAN QUIT BACK TO THE OPENING 
SCREENS BY PRESSING ESC,WHICH WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE MAIN MENU.
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER EVENTS,HOWEVER,YOU HAVE TO GO 
TO THE FIRST MISSION,WHICH IS THE TEST FLIGHT FROM THE 747 [SEE 
MISSIONS,BELOW].

NOW SELECT NEXT MISSION FROM THE MISSIONS MENU,AND YOULL SEE THE TEXT
FOR THE FIRST MISSION.SELECT ACCEPT,IF YOU WANT TO ACCEPT IT,AND YUOLL
FIND YOURSELF ALREADY IN THE AIR,WATCHING THE 747,WITH THE SHUTTLE ON
TOP,JUST BEFORE SEPARATION.FROM HERE ON IN YOU HAVE TO GLIDE THE ORBITER
DOWN TO A SAFE LANDING.ONCE THIS MISSION IS SUCCESSFULLY COMPETED,YOULL
BE ABLE TO SELECT THE NEXT MISSION,TEST LAUNCH KENNEDY,WHICH WILL ALLOW
YOU TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LAUNCH PROCEDURE.

BEFORE STARTING THE MISSION,GO BACK TO THE GAME SETUP OPTION,SELECT 
START POSITION,THEN SELECT LAUNCH PAD,THEN CLICK DONE,AND YOURE READY
TO START THE MISSION.SELECT NEXT MISSION FROM THE MAIN MENU,SKIP PAST
THE MISSION TEXT AS BEFORE,AND YOULL FIND YOURSELF LOOKING AT THE ORBITER
SITTING ON THE LAUNCH PAD.

NOW YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS:

1 SIT AND WAIT WHILE IT GOES THROUGH THE PROPER PRE-LAUNCH COUNTDOWN,
WHICH TAKES FIVE HOURS;

2 SIMPLY SET THE SKIP FACILITY [WITHIN THE WINDOWS MENU OPTION-THIS 
CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH THE ORBITER MENU WITHIN THE MAIN MENU] TO A TIME 
JUST BEFORE LAUNCH,I.E. T-30 SECONDS,THEN SELECT TIME SKIP WITHIN THE
ACTIONS MENU,AND IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE REQUIRED POINT.THIS WILL TAKE
TIME,OF COURSE,BUT THE VIEW IS WORTH THE WAIT.THE ORBITER IS NOW ABOUT
TO LAUNCH - THE REST IS UP TO YOU! FOR MORE DETAILS OF THE TIME SKIP
FEATURE,SEE TIME SKIP BELOW.

KEY CONTROLS:

SEE MISSION GUIDE ALSO DONE BY COBRA OF LSD.

A LETTER T IN THE GAME RUNNING ICON THAT DENOTES THAT THE SIMULATOR 
IS NOW IN TIME ADVANCE MODE.WHILE IN THIS MODE,THE SIMULATOR PAUSES 
UNTIL IT FINDS THE REQUIRED POINT.WHEN IT HAS DONE SO,THE LETTER T 
WILL DISAPPEAR,AND YOULL BE RETURNED TO NORMAL REAL TIME.THE TIME 
AVANCE WILL STOP,HOWEVER,IF A MESSAGE COMES UP FOR AN IN-FLIGHT 
OPEREATION TO BE CARRIED OUT [UNLESS THE HELP LEVEL IS SET TO
COMPLETELY AUTOMATIC OF COURSE-SEE HELP LEVEL,BELOW.]

TIME TO DAYLIGHT HOURS IN THIS INSTANCE WOULD BE EXTREMELY USFUL!

LENGTH OF DAY:

ALLOWS YOU TO DETERMINE HOW LONG A DAY WITHIN THE SIMULATOR TAKES IN
REAL TIME.FOR EXAMPLE,SETTING THIS TO ONE MINUTE,SAY,MEANS THAT THE
EARTH ROTATES ONCE A MINUTE,I.E.,YOULL SEE 30 SECONDS OF LIGHT AND

STOPS THE SIMULATOR AND QUITS TO MSDOS [NOT AMIGA/ST].

CONTROLS AND INSTRUMENTATION:

THIS SECTION IS SPLIT INTO THREE MAIN AREAS LAUNCH,ON-ORBIT OPERATIONS
AND LANDING.SIMILAR TO THE REFERENCE SECTION,ANY FUNCTION THAT OCCURS 
IN MORE THAN ONE MORE THAN ONE STAGE OF THE MISSION WILL BE DESCRIBED
IN DETAIL IN THE SECTION IN THE SECTION IN WHICH IT IS FIRST USED.

MEMORY.

NOTE:

1 IF YOU HAVE A CRT SELECTED,THEN MOVING TO THAT CRT AND PRESSING THE
ALT KEY WILL BRING UP AN OVERLAID WINDOW CONTAINING THE ORBITERS COMPUTER
KEYPAD.

2FOR THE PURPOSES OF SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR,THE AFT CRT AND KEYBOARD
WON`T BE FUNCTIONAL,WITH ONE EXCEPTION:YOU WILL,BY USING THE + AND -
KEYS ON YOUR COMPUTER KEYPAD,AS OPPOSED TO THE KEYPAD ON PANEL C2
WITHIN THE SIMULATOR,BE ABLE TO SCROLL THROUGH AND VIEW,BUT NOT UTILIZE
ALL 29 CRT DISPLAYS USED BY THE REAL SHUTTLE.SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR
WILL ONLY BE USING A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE ACTUAL DISPLAYS,PRIMARILY
THOSE CONCERNED WITH TAKE OFF AND LANDING.WE HOPE TO BRING A MORE 
COMPLETE DISPLAY SYSTEM TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE SIMULATOR.

INSTRUMENT LANDING:

WHEN LANDING THE ORBITER AND ESPECIALLY WHEN ATTEMPTING THE INSTRUMENT
LANDING MISSION IN WHICH YOU MUST BRING THE ORBITER DOWN ON INSTRUMENTS
ALONE,THERE ARE CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS TO KEEP YOUR EYE ON.AS FAR AS SPACE
SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR IS CONCERNED,THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT TO 
MONITOR IS THE SPEC 50 CRT DISPLAY.

THE SPEC 50 DISPLAY SHOWS THE PILOT EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO KNOW WHEN
LANDING BLIND.BASICALLY,THE LARGE CIRCLE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN IS
THE HEADING ALIGNMENT CIRCLE [HAC],IS WHAT YOU MUST AIM FOR WHEN
DECENDING.THE LITTLE SYMBOL NEARBY IS THE POSITION OF THE ORBITER,
AND THE SMALL CIRCLE ATTACHED TO THE LARGE CIRCLE IS THE RUNWAY
TOUCHDOWN POINT,WHICH IS THE OPTIMUM POINT ON THE RUNWAY FOR YOU TO
TOUCHDOWN [THE END NEAREST YOU BASICALLY THE ORBITER NEEDS A LOT OF
SPACE TO LAND].

AS WELL AS THESE GRAPHICS,THERE ARE READOUTS FOR PITCH,ROLL AND YAW,
AS WELL AS ATTITUDE AND SPEEDBRAKE SETTINGS.

TO ACCESS THIS DISPLAY,PRESS SPEC 50 PRO ON THE KEYPAD [PANEL C3].
HOWEVER,WHEN CRT 3 IS TURNED ON,SPEC 50 IS THE DEFAULT DISPLAY.

ASIDE FROM THIS,THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS TO WATCH ARE THE ADI,TO MAKE
SURE YOU ARE COMMING IN STRAIGHT;THE HSI,TO MAKE SURE YOUR NOSE IS 
WHERE IT SHOULD BE ;THE RADAR ALTIMETER,TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR ATTITUDE,
AND THE AVVI,TO MAKE SURE YOU`RE NOT SHEDDING ALTITUDE TOO FAST.THEN
THERE`S THE AMI,TO MAKE SURE YOU`RE NOT COMMING IN TO FAST,AND FINALLY,
OF COURSE,THE SPEEDBRAKE,JUST IN CASE YOU ARE COMMING IN TO FAST.

FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MANUAL INSTRUMENT LANDING PROCEDURES
SEE MISSION PROCEDURES,RE-ENTRY [MM304] AND ONWARDS.IN FACT IT IS A 
GOOD IDEA TO READ THIS BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANY KIND OF LANDING PROCEDURES.

1 TACAN:

ALTHOUGH TACAN IS NORMALLY USED TO GUIDE THE ORBITER IN ON AUTO,IN
SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR YOU`RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO DO WITHOUT
AND LAND ON MANUAL.FOR DETAILS OF THE TACAN SYSTEM,HOWEVER SEE
REFERENCE SECTION.

2 INSTRUMENTS:

AIR DATA SYSTEM:

SEE REFERENCE SECTION.

RADAR ALTIMETER:

SEE REFERENCE SECTION.

ATTITUDE DIRECTION INDICATOR:

THE ATTITUDE SHOWN IS DETERMINED BY THE SETTING OF THE ADI ATTITUDE 
SWITCH ON PANEL F8.THE LOCAL VERTICAL/LOCAL HORIZON [LVLH] SETTING
SHOWS THE ATTITUDE IN RELATION TO THE EARTH.THE INRTL SETTING SHOWS
THE ATTITUDE IN RELATION TO THE INERTAL GUIDENCE SYSTEMS AND IS RELATIVE
TO FIXED ITEMS IN SPACE SUCH AS STARS.THE REF POSITION SHOWS THE ATTITUDE
THE LAST TIME THE ATT REF SWITCH [PANEL F8] WAS DEPRESSED [THIS IS USEFUL
FOR RETURNING TO A PREVIOUS ATTITUDE AFTER A MANEUVER].

EACH ADI HAS THREE RATE POINTERS WHICH SHOW THE ORBITERS ROLL [TOP 
INDICATOR],PITCH [SIDE] AND YAW [BOTTOM] RATES.THE ADI RATE SWITCHES
CONTROL THE RANGE OF THESE INDICATORS [FULL SCALE DEFLECTION AT THE
HIGH SETTING INDICATES 10 DEGREES PER SECOND,MED IS 5 DEG/SEC AND
LOW IS 1 DEG/SEC].THE POINTERS ARE FLY TO WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO 
MOVE THE RHC TOWARDS THE POINTER TO NUL THE EFFECT.DURING MANEUVERS,
THE ERROR BETWEEN THE TARGET ATTITUDE AND THE CURRENT ATTITUDE IS
SHOWN BY THE PITCH,ROLL AND YAW NEEDLES OVER THE ADI BALL.THESE NEEDLES
ARE FLY TO WHICH MEANS THAT THE CORRECT ATTITUDE IS ACHIEVED BY FLYING
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NEEDLES UNTIL THEY CROSS AT THE CENTRE OF THE
BALL.

HORIZONTAL SITUATION INDICATOR:

THE HSI SELECT SWITCHES ON PANELS F6 ANS F8 CONTROL THE MODE OF THE 
ASSOCIATED HSI.

THE MODE SWITCH SELECTS THE FLIGHT PHASE:ENTRY,TAEM AND APPROACH.HOWEVER
FOR THE MOST EFFICIENCY IN SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR ONLY ONE MODE
IS USED FOR ALL PURPOSES.

THE SOURCE SWITCH SELECTS THE SOURCE WHICH DRIVES THE INSTRUMENT:TACAN,
INERTAL NAVIGATION [NAV] OR MICROWAVE SCAN BEAM LANDING SYSTEM [MLS].
THE ORBITER HEADING IS SHOWN AT THE TOP OF THE COMPASS,READ AT THE 
LUBBER LINE.THE COURSE POINTER INDICATES THE DIRECTION OF THE PROGRAMMED
COURSE.THE COURSE DEVIATION INDICATOR IS FLY TO AND SHOWS THE REQUIRD
TRACK RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT ORBITER POSITION.THE CDI FLAG APPEARS 
IF THE INDICATOR DISPLAY IS INVALID.

ANOTHER FLY TO INDICATOR IS THE GLIDE SLOPE INDICATOR WHICH SHOWS THE 
HEIGHT OF THE ORBITER RELATIVE TO THE IDEAL HEIGHT AT THAT POINT ON 
THE GLIDESLOPE.THE GLIDESLOPE INDICATOR IS VALID AFTER RE-ENTRY UNTIL
ABOUT 1500 FEET.IT IS INVALID WHEN THE GS FLAG SHOWS ON THE HSI.THE 
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY BEARING POINTERS SHOW THE RELATIVE POSITION
OF 2 PROGRAMMED BEARINGS AND ARE VALID UNLESS THE BRG FLAG APPEARS.
THE PRIMARY RANGE AND SECONDARY RANGE COUNTERS SHOW THE DISTANCE IN 
NAUTICAL MILES FROM A REFERENCE SOURCE [NORMALLY THE RUNWAY DURING 
THE LATTER STAGES OF THE FLIGHT].THE MAXIMUM TACAN RANGE IS ABOUT 
3999 NAUTICAL MILES.BUT IS NOT NORMALLY SELECTED UNTIL AFTER 
BLACKOUT,AND THE MLS RANGE IS 20 NAUTICAL MILES,USUALLY USED ONCE ON
THE HEADING ALIGNMENT CYLINDER.ON INITIAL ENTRY,NAV IS THE NORMAL
SELECTION.

ALTITUDE AND VERTICAL VELOCITY INDICATOR:

THE ABOVE INDICATORS ARE ONLY VALID AFTER THE DEPLOYMENT OF AN AIR
DATA PROBE USING ONE OF THE AIR DATA SWITCHES BELOW A SPEED OF MACH 3,
USUALLY OCCURRING JUST BEFORE LANDING.ONE OF THE TWO RADAR ALTIMETERS
CAN BE SELECTED USING THE RADAR ALTM SWITCH ON PANEL F6/F8.FOR DETAILS
OF PROBES,SEE AIR DATA PROBES.

ALPHA MACH INDICATOR:

THE ALPHA MACH INDICATORS [AMIs PANELS F6/F8] SHOW FOUR SEPARATE
READINGS:

ALPHA:

SHOWS THE VEHICLE ANGLE OF ATTACK RELATIVE TO THE GROUND.

ACCEL:

SHOWS THE ACCELERATION OR DECELERATION ALONG THE FLIGHT PATH.

M/VEL:

SHOWS THE VELOCITY EITHER IN TERMS OF THOUSANDS OF FEET PER SECOND
UP TO 2000 FPS,OR AS A MACH NUMBER WHERE MACH NUMBER =VREL/1000;

EAS:

SHOWS THE VELOCITY AS AN EQUIVALENT AIRSPEED IN KNOTS.

AS WITH THE AVVI,EACH SCALE SHOWS AN OFF FLAG IF THE INDICATOR
MALFUNCTIONS.

SURFACE POSITION INDICATOR:

SEE REFERENCE SECTION.

RCS COMMAND LIGHTS:

SEE REFERENCE SECTION.

G FORCE METER:

SEE REFERENCE SECTION.

HEAD UP DISPLAY:

THE COMMANDER AND PILOT HUDs ARE ENABLED BY THE HUD POWER SWITCHES ON
PANEL F3.FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE HUDs VARIOUS ELEMENTS,SEE
REFERENCE SECTION.

DIGITAL AUTO PILOT:

BY SWITCHING ON THE ORBITAL DAP MAN SWITCH ON PANEL C3,THE COMMANDER
AND PILOT CAN OVERRIDE THE DAP IF THEY WISH TO HAVE MANUAL CONTROL OR
IN A CONTINGENCY SITUATION.NOTE:THE ORBITER IS FLY BY WIRE SO EVEN 
WHEN UNDER MANUAL CONTROL,THE MANUAL COMMANDS ARE STILL PROCESSED BY 
THE COMPUTER.

1 SELECT:

THESE TWO BUTTONS DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THRUST,AS WELL AS WHICH
COMBINATION OF JETS TO BE FIRED FOR ANY GIVEN OPERATION. A NORMALLY
ALLOWS HIGHER THRUSTS THAN B.IN SPACE SHUTTLE WE ONLY USE A.HOWEVER 
WE DO ALLOW YOU TO TOGGLE BETWEEN THEM EVEN THOUGH IT WONT ALTER
ANYTHING.

2 AUTO/MAN:

ONCE IN MAN YOU CAN TRANSLATE AND ROTATE THE ORBITER USING THE RCS JETS.
WHILE IN AUTO THE ORBITER IS UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL:HOWEVER,FOR GAME
PURPOSES,ALL IN ORBIT MANEUVERS ARE PERFORMED IN MANUAL.

3 NORM/VERN:

VERNIER JETS FIRE WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE QUARTER THE STRENGTH OF THE
NORMAL JETS AND ARE MOSTLY USED FOR FINE POSITIONING.ORDINARILY IF 
YOU ARE TRACKING A SATELLITE OVER A LARGE DISTANCE YOU SHOULD USE
THE NORM JETS AND THEN SWITCH TO THE VERN JETS WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO
GRAB THE SATELLITE WITH THE RMS.

4 TRANSLATION:

THE TERM TRANSLATION MEANS TO PHYSICALLY MOVE THE ORBITER,FOR EXAMPLE
LEFT,RIGHT,UP,AND DOWN ETC.THE ORBITER CAN MOVE ON 3 AXES,X,Y,Z.
SIMPLY X IS EITHER FORWARDS OR BACKWARDS,Y IS LEFT OR RIGHT AND Z IS
UP OR DOWN.

THERE ARE 9 TRANSLATIONAL BUTTONS SPLIT INTO 3 COLUMNS OF 3.YOU WILL
NOTICE THAT EACH COLUMN IS HEADED WITH THE LETTERS X,Y AND Z.HIGH,
NORM AND PULSE.NORM RESULTS IN CONTINUOUS JET FIRINGS,GIVING THE EFFECT
OF CONSTANTLY INCREASING THE REVELANT TRANSLATION RATE.
WHEN PULSE IS SELECTED FOR ANY GIVEN AXIS A SINGLE BURST OF JET FIRE 
IS PRODUCED WITH EACH KEY PRESS.HIGH HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS NORM.

5 ROTATION:

THE TERM ROTATION MEANS TO SPIN THE ORBITER ON ANY AXIS ABOUT ITS CENTRE.
THERE ARE 9 ROTATIONAL BUTTONS SPLIT INTO 3 COLUMNS OF 3.YOU WILL NOTICE
THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL COLUMN IS HEADED WITH THE LETTERS ROLL,PITCH AND
YAW.EACH COLUMN HAS THE BUTTONS DISC RATE,ACCEL,AND PULSE.SIMPLY WHEN
DISC RATE IS SELECTED,JET FIRINGS CONTINUE FOR AS LONG AS THE KEY IS
DEPRESSED AND WILL ROTATE AT NO MORE THAN 4 DEGREES PER SECOND IF
NORM IS SELECTED AND 1 DEGREE PER SECOND IF VERN IS SELECTED.WHEN 
ACCEL IS SELECTED CONTINUOUS JET FIRINGS ARE MADE UNTIL THE KEY IS
RELEASED,THISHAS THE EFFECT OF CONSTANTLY INCREASING THE REVELENT
ROTATIONAL RATE.WHEN PULSE IS SELECTED FOR ANY GIVEN AXIS,A SINGLE 
BURST OF JET FIRE IS PRODUCED WITH EACH KEY PRESS.

WITH BOTH THE ROTATION AND THE TRANSLATION BUTTONS EACH AXIS IS 
INDEPENDANT OF THE OTHER.

AS YOU BECOME MORE EXPERIENCED AT FLYING THE ORBITER YOU WILL FIND
THE DAP VERY USFUL.

FURTHER REFERENCE:

SEE ALSO GPC FOR FLIGHT PHASES.

RORATIONAL HAND CONTROLERS:

WHEN THE CONTROLERS ARE ENABLED BY THE FLT CNTLR SWITCHES ON PANEL F6
[COMMANDER],F8 [PILOT] AND A6 [AFT],USING THE RHC WILL OVERRIDE AUTOMATIC
MODE AND PASS CONTROL TO MANUAL MODE.THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS IS IN
THE ASCENT STAGE WHERE THE STICK MUST BE ENABLED BY PRESSING THE CSS
BUTTONS FOR PITCH AND ROLL/YAW ON PANEL F2 [PILOT] OR PANEL F4 [COMMANDER].
THE AFT SENSE SWITCH ON PANEL A6 IS USED TO SWITCH THE SENSE OF THE
AFT CONTROL STICK SO THAT MOVEMENTS ARE ALONG THE LINE OF SIGHT OF THE
USER,INSTEAD OF WORKING BACKWARDS,AS THEY WOULD NORMALLY APPEAR TO DO.
IF A FAILURE IS DETECTED IN THE PILOTS OR COMMANDERS RHC,THE RED RHC
WARNING LIGHT ON PANEL F7 IS ILLUMINATED.

THE GUARDED BUTTON ON THE RHCs ENGAGE THE BFS AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED
IN CONTINGENCY SITUATIONS:HOWEVER,THIS WONT BE AN OPERATIONAL OPTION
FOR USERS OF SPACE SHTTLE THE SIMULATOR.

SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR CAN ACCEPT RHC CONTROL FROM THE KEYPAD/
CURSOR KEYS.MOVING THE CURSOR UP/DOWN (8/2) CONTROLS MOVEMENT IN
THE PITCH AXIS.MOVING THE CURSOR LEFT/RIGHT (4/6) CONTROLS ROLL
MOVEMENT.UNFORTUNATELY,COMPUTER KEYBOARDS ARNT AS ADVANCED AS
THE SPACE SHUTTLE RHCs,SO YAW MOVEMENT IS CONTROLLEDBY THE ,. KEYS.
THE SIMULATOR TREATS THE KEYPAD AS AN RHC DURING ASCENT,INSERTION,DE-
ORBIT,RE-ENTRY AND LANDING [DURING ORBIT ITS TREATED AS A TRANSLATIONAL
HAND CONTROLLER].

TO SWITCH BETWEEN THE TWO CONTROLLERS,PRESS F TO ACCESS THE FRONT RHC
AND A FOR THE AFT RHC.

HOWEVER,ONLY THE TWO FRONT RHCs WILL BE OPERABLE DURING FLIGHT PHASES:
ONLY DURING ON ORBIT MANEUVERS WILL YOU BE ABLE TO TRANSFER CONTROL 
TO THE AFT RHC.

TRANSLATIONAL HAND CONTROLLERS:

THE CONTROLLERS ARE ENABLED BY THE FLT CNTRL SWITCHES ON PANEL F6
[COMMANDER] AND A6 [AFT],AND FOR THE SAME REASONS AS FOR THE RHCs,
THE AFT SENSE SWITCH ON PANEL A6 IS USED TO SWITCH THE SENSE OF THE 
AFT THC.

USER CONTROL:

SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR CAN ACCEPT THC TYPE CONTROL FROM THE 
KEYPAD/CURSOR KEYS.AS WITH THE RHCs [ABOVE],MOVING THE CURSOR UP/
DOWN (8/2) CONTROLS MOVEMENTIN THE PITCH AXIS,MOVING THE CURSOR
LEFT/RIGHT (4/6) CONTROLS ROLL MOVEMENT,AND YAW MOVEMENT IS
CONTROLLED BY THE , . KEYS.THE SIMULATOR TREATS THE KEYBOARD AS A THC
DURING ORBITAL MANEUVERS [DURING ASSCENT,INSERTION,DE-ORBIT,RE-ENTRY
AND LANDING IT IS TREATED AS AN RHC].AS WITH RHCs,THE AFT THC IS ONLY
AVAILABLE DURING ON-ORBIT OPERATIONS.

RUDDER PEDALS:

THE RUDDER PEDALS ARE ENABLED BY FLT CNTRL SWITCHES ON PANEL F7 [COMMANDER]
AND F8 [PILOT].

SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR ACCEPTS RUDDER CONTROL USING THE SAME , 
AND . KEYS AS FOR IN SPACE [YAW LEFT/RIGHT],BUT WONT BE SIMULATING THE 
BRAKING ABILITIES OF THE RUDDER PEDALS IN THIS VERSION.

THRUST AND BRAKING:

WHEN UNDER CONTROL OF THE GPCs, THE SPD BK/THROT BUTTON LIGHTS ON PANELS
F2 AND F4 INDICATE AUTO.TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE THRUST/BRAKES,THE PILOT
MUST DEPRESS THE TAKEOVER SWITCH ON HIS THRUST CONTROLLER AND MOVE THE
LEVER UNTIL ITS SETTING MATCHES THE LAST COMPUTER THRUST [OR BRAKE] 
SETTING.MANUAL CONTROL IS NOW ATTAINED AND THE SPD BK/THROT LIGHTS INDICATE
MAN.

THE TAKEOVER SWITCH CAN NOW BE RELEASED.CONTROL CAN BE RESTORED TO THE
COMPUTERS BY PRESSING THE SPD BK/THROT BUTTON.
THRUST/SPEED BRAKE CONTROL IS ENABLED BY THE FLT CNTRL SWITCHES ON 
PANEL F7 [COMMANDER] AND F8 [PILOT].

THE SPEED BRAKE/THROTTLE WITHIN SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR DOESNT NEED
TO BE TAKEN OVER,AS IT IS PERMANENTLY AVAILABLE.USE THE -/= KEYS ON THE
KEYPAD TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE THROTTLE OR SPEED BRAKE.

PAYLOAD BAY:

PAYLOAD BAY DOORS:

BEFORE YOU CAN OPEN THE DOORS,YOU HAVE TO ENABLE THE AC MOTORS,WHICH
ARE LABELLED PL BAY DOOR SYS1 AND SYS2.THE PAYLOAD BAY DOOR CONTROL
SWITCHES ARE LOCATED ON PANEL R13L.POWER IS INITIATED TO THE PAYLOAD
BAY DOOR POWER AND CONTROL SYSTEMS BY SWITCHING THE PL BAY DOOR SWITCHES
TO ENABLE AND SETTING THE LATCH CONTROL OPEN/CLOSE SWITCH TO OPEN.THIS
THEN INITIATES THE AUTOMATIC SEQUENCES,AND THE PL BAY DOOR INDICATOR
SHOWS THE DOOR STATUS.PROCEDURE TIME IS 64 SECONDS,DURING WHICH THE 
INDICATORS WILL BE AT BARBERPOLE.THE CLOSING PROCEDURE IS THE SAME IN
REVERSE,SETTING THE SWITCH TO CLOSE INSTEAD OF OPEN.THE STOP POSITION
STOPS THE SEQUENCE IN PROGRESS.

PAYLOAD BAY RADIATORS:

RELEASING THE RADIATORS ALLOWS HEAT TO ESCAPE FROM THE ORBITER.DEPLOYMENT
IS A TWO STAGE OPERATION,AS THE RADIATORS ARE LATCHED DOWN FOR SAFTY
REASONS.BEFORE RELEASING THE LATCHES YOU FIRST HAVE TO ENABLE THE POWER.
TO DO THIS,CLICK THE PL BAY MECH PWR SYS1 AND SYS2 SWITCHES TO ENABLE.
ONLY ENABLING ONE OF THEM WILL HALVE THE SPEED AT WHICH THE LATCHES 
AND THE RADIATORS DEPLOY.

ONCE POWERED,RELEASE THE STBD AND PORT LATCHES BY CLICKING THE LATCH
CONTROL SYSA AND SYSB SWITCHES TO RELEASE.THE INDICATORS ABOVE THE
SWITCHES WILL NOW BE ON BARBERPOLE.WHEN THE LATCHES ARE RELEASED THESE
INDICATORS WILL SHOW REL.

TO DEPLOY THE RADIATORS CLICK THE RADIATOR CONTROL SYS A AND SYS B 
SWITCHES TO DEPLOY.ONCE DEPLOYED,THE INDICATORS WILL SHOW DPY.

MANNED MANEUVERING UNIT:

SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE FULL CONTROL OVER THE 
MMU WHEN ONE IS BEING CARRIED BY THE ORBITER.ONCE YOU ARE IN ORBIT,
AND YOU HAVE ACCESSED THE MISSION COMMS,THE MMU IS UTILIZED BY SIMPLY
SELECTING MMU FROM THE VIEWS OPTION,OR BY PRESSING F6.YOU WILL NOW BE 
TRANSFERED INSIDE THE UNIT,WITHOUT ANY WORRIES ABOUT ANY 3 HOUR PRE-
BREATHING OPERATION.OBVIOUSLY,IT CANT BE USED AT ANT TIME OTHER THAN 
IN ORBIT.

NEXT PRESS SHIFT F6,AND THE UNIT WILL UNLATCH FROM THE CARGO BAY WALL
[ALT F6 RE-LATCHES IT ON RETURNING TO THE BAY].WE HAVE ASSIGNED UNIQUE
KEYS THAT CONTROL THE ROTATION AND TRANSLATION OF THE MMU.THIS WAY YOU
CAN CONTROL THE MMU WHILE VIEWING IT FROM ANY OTHER ANGLE,FOR EXAMPLE,
OUT OF THE AFT PAYLOAD BAY WINDOWS.

PAYLOAD DEPLOYMENT AND RESCUE:

SEE MISSIONS,QUICK REFERENCE.

REMOTE MANIPULATOR SYSTEM:

IN SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR ONLY THE PORT RMS ARM IS USED,ALTHOUGH 
YOU STILL HAVE TO SELECT IT.TO DO THIS,USE THE RMS SELECT SWITCH ON 
PANEL A8L.NEXT ENERGISE THE RMS BY USING THE RMS POWER SWITCH.FOR PLAYER
CONTROLS SEE KEYBOARD CONTROLS.

DURING LAUNCH THE ARM IS LATCHED AT THE SHOULDER,BUT DOES NOT NEED TO 
BE RE-LATCHED FOR RE-ENTRY AND LANDING.THE SHOULDER BRACE LATCH IS RELEASED
ONCE IN ORBIT USING THE SWITCH ON PANEL A8 TO RELEASE THE ARM.THIS SWITCH
MUST BE HELD OVER UNTIL THE ASSOCIATED INDICATOR TURNS GRAY [ABOUT 6-9
SECONDS].

THE ARM IS DEPLOYED TO ITS OPERATIONAL REST POSITION AFTER THE PAYLOAD 
DOORS ARE OPENED AND STOWED AGAIN BEFORE THEY ARE CLOSED USING THE 
APPROPRIATE DEPLOY/STOW SWITCH ON A8L.DEPLOYMENT AND STOWAGE TAKE ABOUT
34 SECONDS.THE STATUS OF THE ARM IS SHOWN BY THE INDICATOR ABOVE THE 
RELEVANT DEPLOY/STOW SWITCH.

WHEN DEPLOYED THE ARM MUST BE LATCHED UNTIL IT IS NEEDED FOR USE,USING
THE APPROPRIATE LATCH/RELEASE SWITCH.THE AFT MID AND FWD READY FOR LATCH
INDICATORS TURN GRAY WHEN THE ARM IS DEPLOYED AND IN POSITION FOR LATCHING
AND THE LATCH/RELEASE SWITCH IS THEN ACTIVATED.

THE INDICATOR ABOVE THE SWITCH CHANGES TO LAT WHEN THE ARM IS LATCHED.

RMS CAMERAS:

THE RMS RELATED CCTV SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR CAMERAS IN THE PAYLOAD BAY
ALL OF WHICH CAN BE PANNED AND TILTED.HOWEVER,SINCE SPACE SHUTTLE THE 
SIMULATOR ONLY USES THE PORT RMS ARM,IT ONLY USES THE TWO PORT CAMERAS.
TO SELECT,USE THE RMS PORT SWITCH ON THE VIDEO INPUT SECTION OF THE 
AFT PANEL,THEN SET THE RMS CAMERA SWITCH BELOW THE AFT RHC TO EITHER
WRIST OR ELBOW.

STANDARD END EFFECTOR:

SEE REFERENCE SECTION.

JETTISONING THE ARM:

SEE REFERENCE SECTION.

COMMUNICATIONS:

KU BAND ANTENNA:

DEPLOY [PANEL R13] DEPLOYS THE KU ANTENNA,ENSURING THAT THE PAYLOAD BAYS
ARE OPEN FIRST.THE INDICATOR ABOVE THE SWITCH SHOWS THE CURRENT STATUS OF
THE ANTENNA.STOWAGE IS THE REVERSAL OF DEPLOYMENT BOTH OPERATIONS TAKE
ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

DIRECT STOW [PANEL R13] IN CONTINGENCY SITUATIONS THE ANTENNA CAN BE 
STOWED USING THIS OVERRIDE SWITCH.IF THIS STILL FAILS,THE ANTENNA CAN
BE JETTISONED,USING THE SAME ROUTINE AS FOR THE RMS JETTISON,EXCEPT 
THAT THE ANTENNA IS NOT JETTISONED,BUT MERELY RELEASED.THE ORBITER
THEN MUST MANEUVER AWAY FROM IT.

CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION SYSTEM [CCTV]:

ALL CAMERAS ARE LINKED INTO MONITORS ON PANEL A3,FROM WHICH YOU CAN
SELECT THE DESIRED CAMERAS,AS WELL AS PAN AND TILT THEM.

THE VIEW ON PANEL A3 IS IN MONO.

3 LANDING:

LANDING GEAR:

THE LANDING GEAR IS DEPLOYED BY THE COMMANDER OR PILOT PRESSING GUARDED
SWITCHES ARM AND DN ON PANEL F6 OR F8.THE LANDING GEAR STATUS IS SHOWN
ON INDICATORS ABOVE THESE SWITCHES.THE LANDING GEAR DEPLOY AND NOSE WHEEL
STEERING IS POWERED BY HYDRAULIC SYSTEM 1.IF THERE IS A HYDRAULIC [OR
OTHER] FAILURE AND THE GAER FAILS TO START TO DEPLOY,WITHIN ONE SECOND
PYROTECHNIC JETS FIRE TO DEPLOY THE GEAR.IF HYDRAULIC SYSTEM1 FAILS,THE
ORBITER IS STEERED AFTER LANDING BY DIFFERENTIAL BRAKING ON THE MAIN
GEAR [POWERED BY HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS 2 AND 3].LOSS OF HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS
1 AND 3,OR 2 AND 3,WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF HALF THE BRAKING PRESSURE
ON EACH WHEEL,AND WOULD REQUIRE AN INCREASED BRAKING DISTANCE ON LANDING.
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT EXCEPT BRAKE HARDER AND EARLIER!

THE NOSE WHEEL IS STEERED EITHER BY THE GPCs OR,IN CONTINGENCY SITUATIONS,
BY THE CONTROL STICK OR RUDDER PEDELS.THE MODE IS SELECTED BY SETTING
THE NWS SWITCH ON PANEL L2 TO DIRECT.HOWEVER,THE NOSE WHEEL STEERING
IS STILL EFFECTED BY FAILURES TO THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS.

3 REFERENCE SECTION:

THIS SECTION GIVES A DESCRIPTION OF,AND ANY NECCESSARY BACKGROUND TO
EACH AND EVERY PART AND FUNCTION OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE,AS USED IN SPACE
SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR.

THE REFERENCE SECTION IS SPLIT INTO THREE MAJOR ACTIVITIES,LAUNCH,
ON ORBIT OPERATIONS AND LANDING,WITH EACH ASPECT OF THE SHUTTLE BEING
COVERED UNDER THAT SECTION FOR WHICH IT HAS THE MOST RELEVANCE.IN THE
CASE OF AN ITEM BEING EQUALLY ASS IMPORTANT TO MORE THAN ONE STAGE OF 
THE SHUTTLES ACTIVITIES,WE HAVE GIVEN THE FULL DESCRIPTION AND BACKGROUND
WHERE APPLICABLE,IN THE FIRST SUCH OCCURRENCE.

SUMMARY OF PANELS:

THE CONTROLS AND INSTRUMENTATION OF THE REAL SPACE SHUTTLE ARE UNDERSTANDABLY
COMPLEX.SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR ACCURATELY REPRODUCES THE LAYOUT
AND FUNCTIONS OF ALL THE GENUINE PRIMARY SHUTTLE CONTROLS.

1 LAUNCH:

WATER SPRAY BOILERS:

THESE ARE LOCATED IN THE AFT FUSELAGE OF THE ORBITER,AND ARE USED TO
COOL DOWN THE POWER UNIT,LUBE OIL AND HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS DURING BOTH 
ASCENT AND DE-ORBIT PHASES.THERE ARE THREE BOILERS IN ALL,AND THEY 
STORE WATER IN A BELLOWS-TYPE STORAGE TANK PRESSURIZED BY GASEOUS
NITROGEN.

ALONG WITH THE THREE APUs AND THE HYDRAULIC PUMPS,THE WATER SPRAY 
BOILERS ARE IN OPERATION FIVE MINUTES BEFORE TAKE OFF,ALTHOUGH THE 
BOILERS ARE PRE ACTIVATED FORTY-FIVE MINUTES BEFORE THIS.ONE OF THESE
BOILERS IS ALSO OPENED BRIEFLY ONE DAY BEFORE DE-ORBIT DURING A FLIGHT
CONTROL SYSTEM CHECKOUT.

BOILER N2 SUPPLY 1/2/3 [PANEL R2]:

CONTROLS THE NITROGEN SHUT-OFF VALVES,WHICH MAINTAIN WATER PRESSURE 
IN THE BIOLERS.

APU FUEL/H2O QTY [PANEL F8]:

ALLOWS THE WATER QUANTITY OF EACH BOILER TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE 1/2/3
METERS ON THE SAME PANEL.

1/2/3 [PANEL R2]:

i] OPERATES THE TWO BOILER CONTROLERS.WHEN THE RELEVANT SWITCH IS AT
POSITION A,THE A CONTROLLER FOR THAT BOILER IS POWERED,AND LIKEWISE 
FOR POSITION B.WHEN AT OFF,ELECTRICAL POWER IS REMOVED FROM BOTH
CONTROLLERS.

ii] OPERATES THE ELECTRICAL HEATERS WHEN IN ORBIT TO PREVENT WATER 
FREEZE UP IN ORBIT.THE HEATERS APPLY TO THE SAME BOILERS AS DO THE 
POWER SWITCHES,AND THE ACCESS METHOD IS ALSO THE SAME.

1/2/3 [PANEL R2]:

ENABLES [i.e.,PROVIDES THE AUTOMATIC CONTROL FUNCTIONS FOR ] THE 
RELEVANT CONTROLLER SELECTED BY THE PREVIOUS SWITCH [ABOVE].

WHEN ENABLED,THE READY SIGNAL APPEARS ON THE CORRESPONDING APU/HYD 
READY TO START TALKBACK INDICATOR ON PANEL R2,AS LONG AS THE FOLLOWING
HAS BEEN ACTIONED: N2 SHUT-OFF VALVE IS OPEN,STEAM VENT NOZZLE TEMPERATURE
IS > 130 F,AND THE HYDRAULIC FLUID BY-PASS VALVE IS IN THE CORRECT 
POSITION WITH REGARD TO THE HYDRAULIC FLUID TEMPERATURE.

FURTHER REFERENCE:

SEE LANDING GEAR.

PROBLEMS:

AS THE BOILERS AND HAETERS ARE IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED WITH THE SMOOTH
RUNNING OF THE APUs ON ASCENT,YOU MUST CHECK TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY
ARE READING AND OPERATING CORRECTLY AT ALL TIMES.ONCE THE PILOT HAS 
INITIATED THE APU PRE-START SEQUENCE,HE CONFIRMS THAT THE WATER SPRAY
BOILERS ARE ACTIVATED BEFORE HE DOES ANYTHING ELSE.AT T-5 MINUTES THE
PILOT STARTS THE THREE POWER UNITS BY SETTING THE APU/CNTL SWITCHES 
TO START/RUN AND CHECKING THE HYDRAULIC PRESSURE GAUGES FOR AN INDICATION
OF APPROXIMATELY 600-1000 psi.HE THEN PRESSURIZES THE MAIN PUMP AND 
LOOKS FOR APPROXIMATELY 3000 psi ON THE GAUGES.ALL THREE HYDRAULIC 
MAIN PUMP PRESSURES MUST BE GREATER THAN 2800 psi BY T-4 MINUTES OR
THE AUTOMATIC LAUNCH SEQUENCER WILL ABORT THE LAUNCH.THIS IS NOT 
SOMETHING THAT THE PILOT CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT,OF COURSE,AND THE 
SHUTTLE MUST THEN BE RETURNED FOR A COMPLETE CHECK OVER.

CRT DISPLAY SYSTEM:

THE MCDS ON THE ORBITER CREW COMPARTMENT FLIGHT DECK ALLOWS ONBOARD 
MONITORING OF ORBITER SYSTEMS,COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROCESSING AND MANUAL
CONTROL FOR FLIGHT CREW DATA AND SOFTWARE MANIPULATION.THE SYSTEM IS
COMPOSED OF THREE TYPES HARDWARE: DISPLAY ELECTRONIC UNITS [DEUs],
DISPLAY UNITS THAT INCLUDE THE CRTs,AND KEYBOARD UNITS,WHICH TOGETHER
COMMUNICATE WITH THE GPCs OVER THE DISPLAY/KEYBOARD DATA BUS NETWORK
[SEE GPCs BELOW].THE MCDS PROVIDES ALMOST IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO FLIGHT
CREW ENQUIRIES THROUGH DISPLAYS,GRAPHS,TRAJECTORY PLOTS AND PREDICTIONS
ABOUT FLIGHT PROGRESS.THE CREW CONTROLS THE VEHICLE SYSTEM OPERATION
THROUGH THE USE OF KEYBOARDS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DISPLAY UNITS.

THREE KEYBOARDS ARE LOCATED ON THE FLIGHT DECK:TWO ON THE LEFT AND 
RIGHT SIDES OF THE FLIGHT DECK CENTRE CONSOLE [PANEL C2] AND ONE ON 
THE FILGHT DECK AT THE SIDE AFT FLIGHT STATION [PANEL R12].DEPENDING
ON CREW REQUIREMENTS AND PREFERENCES,EACH OF THE FRONT KEYBOARDS CAN
COMMUNICATE WITH ANY OF THE FRONT DEUs: THE AFT KEYBOARD,HOWEVER,IS 
ONLY WIRED TO DISPLAY ON THE AFT DEU.

PROBLEMS:

IF THE CRTs GO,THERE IS LITTLE THE CREW CAN DO ABOUT IT.THE LIKELIHOOD
OF ALL OF THEM GOING AT ONCE IS EXTREMELY REMOTE,HOWEVER,THE ONLY THING
THE CREW CAN DO IS TO REPLACE A BLOWN CRT WITH ONE OF THE OTHERS I.E.,
IF ONE OF THE FRONT CRTs WENT,THE CREW COULD REPLACE IT WITH THE AFT
ONE.THIS SIMULATOR IS NOT,FOR OBVIOUS REASONS,ABLE TO RECREATE THIS
EMERGENCY.

GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTERS [GPCs]:

ALMOST ALL OF THE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE SPACE SHUTTLE ARE 
CONTROLLED OR OVERSEEN BY THE MAIN COMPUTER SYSTEM.THE DPS [DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM] CONSISTS OF FIVE GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTERS [GPCs]
CONNECTED TO THE MANY HUNDREDS OF FEEDBACK SENSORS AND ACTUATORS 
THROUGHTOUT THE SHUTTLE.THESE ARE EACH MADE UP OF A CENTRAL PROCESSING
UNIT [CPU] AND AN INPUT/OUTPUT PROCESSOR [IOP],AND EACH OF THE FIVE
DO A DIFFERENT JOB.ALL FIVE ARE IBM AP-101 COMPUTERS,AND CONTAIN A MEMORY
AREA FOR STORING DATA AND SOFTWARE.THEY ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO
AS THE SHUTTLES MAIN MEMORY,INTO WHICH ARE LOADED ALL THE FLIGHT AND
OPERATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE [OR EXECUTIVE] CONTROLS THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND
MONITORS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM.IT ALSO SUPPORTS THE USER INTERFACE
MODULES TO PROVIDE INTERACTION WITH THE CREW.

THE APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE CONSISTS OF SPECIFIC MODULES TO MANAGE
NAVIGATION AND CONTROL ETC.,AT VARIOUS STAGES OF THE MISSION.EACH MAJOR
MODULE OF OPERATIONS OR OPS HAS A NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH IT:

OPS 1 ASCENT
OPS 2 ON ORBIT
OPS 3 REENTRY
OPS 4 ORBIT OPERATIONS
OPS 6 RTLS [LOADED ALONG WITH OPS 1]
OPS 8 ON ORBIT CHECKOUT
OPS 9 COMPUTER UTILITIES

EACH MAJOR OPS ALSO HAS A PARTICULAR CRT DISPLAY ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

GPC POWER ON/OFF [PANEL O6]:

FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO TURN THE THINGS ON.THESE SWITCHES ARE GUARDED,
AS,FOR ONE,THEY CONTROL 600 WATTS OF POWER EACH,AND MOREOVER THE GPCs
SHOULD NOT BE TURNED OFF INADVERTENTLY.

GPC OUTPUT [PANEL O6]:

HAS THREE POSITIONS: BACKUP,NORMAL AND TERMINATE BACKUP IS ONLY USED 
FOR THE GPC CONTAINING THE BFS,WHICH STOPS IT BEING USED UNTIL NEEDED;
ALL SWITCHES FOR OPERATING GPCs WILL BE SET AT NORMAL,WHEREAS THE GPCs
CONTROLLING SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT [IE ON ORBIT OPERATIONS] WILL BE POSITIONED
AT TERMINATE,AS THEY SHOULDNT BE COMMANDING ANYTHING DURING THE FLIGHT
PHASES.

MODE [PANEL O6]:

THREE POSITIONS- RUN,STBY AND HALT.NORMALLY IF THESE SWITCHES ARE 
PUT INTO HALT IN THE RUN POSITION,THE SOFTWARE IS PRECLUDED FROM 
OPERATING.HOWEVER,IF THE SWITCHES ARE PUT INTO STBY,THE SOFTWARE CAN
STILL NOT BE EXECUTED,BUT THE GPC IS IN A SOFTWARE CONTROLLED STATE.
NORMAL PRACTICE IS TO GO FROM HALT TO STBY AND THEN TO RUN,AND VICE 
VERSA,AS THIS GIVES THE SOFTWARE A CHANCE TO READY AND CLEAN ITSELF 
UP.

ORBITER FLIGHT COMPUTER SOFTWARE:

REFERS TO ALL THE VARIOUS SOFTWARE COMMANDS THAT ARE TYPED IN AT THE
REVELANT MOMENT BY THE FLIGHT CREW.

PROBLEMS:

IF THE MAIN GPC FAILS,THE SHUTTLE HAS ITS OWN BACKUP FLIGHT SYSTEM,OR
BFS,WHICH IS LOAEDED INTO THE GPCs AND THE MASS MEMORY UNIT.AS ITS ONLY
CONCERNED WIHT THE EMERGENCY ASCENT,INSERTION INTO ORBIT OR DE-ORBIT
OF THE SHUTTLE,IT HAS A GREAT DEAL LESS INFORMATION STORED WITHIN IT.

THUS IT TAKES UP ONLY ONE OF THE GPCs (ORDINARILY No 5),ALTHOUGH ANY
OF THE GPCs COULD BECOME A BFS IF NECESSARY.REMEMBER GPC 5 MUST BE 
SWITCHED ON AT THE PRE-LAUNCH PHASE,OTHERWISE THE SHUTTLE WONT TAKE
OFF.

OTHER THAN THIS,HOWEVER,FOR THE PURPOSES OF SPACE SHUTTLE THE SIMULATOR,
THE BFS WONT BE OPERABLE.

ORBITAL MANEUVERING SYSTEM:

THE ORBITAL MANEUVERING SYSTEM [OMS] IS HOUSED IN TWO PODS,ONE ON EACH
SIDE OF THE AFT FUSELAGE.THE OMS CONTAINS 23,878 POUNDS OF PROPELLANT
AND IS ABLE TO DELIVER 6000 POUNDS THRUST FROM NOZZLES WHICH CAN BE 
GIMBALLED BY UP TO 6 DEGREES.THE OMS IS FIRST USED JUST AFTER MAIN 
ENGINE CUT OFF [MECO] AND EXTERNAL TANK [ET] SEPARATION TO BOOST THE
SHUTTLE INTO AN ELLIPTICAL ORBIT.THIS IS CALLED OMS 1.DEPENDANT ON 
THE MISSION,A SECOND BURN MIGHT BE NEEDED AT THE ORBITS APOGEE [FURTHEST
POINT] TO MAKE IT MORE CIIRCULAR.THIS IS CALLED OMS 2.IF ONLY ONE OMS
BURN IS USED,THIS IS KNOWN AS DIRECT INSERTION [INTO ORBIT].

THE PODS ALSO HOUSE THE AFT REACTION CONTROL SYSTEM [RCS].THERE IS ALSO
A FORWARD REACTION CONTROL SYSTEM IN THE NOSE OF THE CRAFT IN FRONT
OF THE CREW COMPARTMENT.ALL TOGETHER,THE RCS COMPRISES 38 PRIMARY 
THRUSTERS EACH DELIVERING 870 POUNDS THRUST AND SIX VERNIER ENGINES 
FOR FINE ADJUSTMENTS,EACH DELIVERING 24 POUNDS.

THE RCS IS USED JUST AFTER ET SEPARATION TO MANEUVER THE ORBITER CLEAR
OF THE TANK.THE RCS IS ALSO USED THROUGHOUT THE FLIGHT TO AJUST THE 
PITCH,ROLL AND YAW OF THE SPACE CRAFT,AND TO COUNTER MOVEMENTS OUTSIDE
THE RANGE OF THE OMS GIMBALLING SYSTEM.

THE OMS IS USED IN RE-ENTRY UNTIL THE AIR PRESSURE IS SUCH THAT THE 
ELEVONS AND RUDDER CAN TAKE OVER.
THE HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN PROPELLANTS ARE HELIUM PRESSURIZED THROUGH THE
PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.THE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS COMPLEX
AND USUALLY CONTROLLED BY COMPUTER.IN CONTINGENCY SITUATIONS,THE CREW
CAN CARRY OUT MANY OPERATIONS USING MANUAL SWITCHES.
THE RCS IS NORMALLY CONTROLLED BY THE DIGITAL AUTOPILOT [DAP] OR MANUALLY
USING THE ROTATIONAL HAND CONTROLLER [RCS] OR THE TRANSLATIONAL HAND
CONTROLLER [THC] VIA THE GPCs.

THE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS COMPLEX AND NORMALLY COMPUTER 
CONTROLLED,AS LONG AS THE SWITCHES ON PANEL O8 ARE SET TO GPC.ALL THE 
PILOT WILL NORMALLY BE CONCERNED WITH ARE THE PROPELLANT AND PRESSURIZATION
SYSTEM PRESSURES,WHICH ARE SHOWN ON THE OMS PRESS GAUGES ON PANEL F7,
AND THE FUEL LEVELS,SHOWN ON THE RCS/OMS PRESS GAUGES ON PANEL O3.

FOR FULL BRAKEDOWN OF THE OPERATION OF THE OMS ENGINES,SEE THE OMS 
BURN SEQUENCES UNDER LAUNCH SEQUENCE WITHIN THE MISSION PROCEDURES SECTION
AT THE END OF THE MANUAL.

FURTHER REFERENCE:

SEE ALSO MAIN PROPULSION SYSTEM AND AUXILIARY POWER UNITS.

LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM:

THE CREW COMPARTMENT IS PRESSURIZED TO 14.7 psi BY AN 80/20 NITROGEN/
OXYGEN AIR MIX.THE SYSTEM HAS TWO SEPARATE OXYGEN SUPPLIES,TWO NITROGEN 
SUPPLIES PLUS AN EMERGENCY OXYGEN SUPPLY.

THE AIR SUPPLIES ARE CONTROLLED BY SWITCHES ON PANEL L2.THE CABIN 
PRESSURE AND FLOW RATES ARE SHOWN AN GAUGES ON PANEL O1.IF THE CABIN 
PRESSURE FALLS [OR RISES] TOO FAR,OR IF AN INCREASED NITROGEN OR OXYGEN
FLOW IS DETECTED [INDICATING A POSSIBLE LEAK],THE MASTER ALARMS GO OFF,
THE CABIN ATM LIGHT ON PANEL F7 ILLUNINATES AND A KLAXON SOUNDS IN THE
CREW CABIN.

THE CABIN VENT SWITCHES ON PANEL L2 ARE USED TO VENT THE CABIN TO EQUALIZE
THE INTERNAL PRESSURE WITH THE EXTERNAL PRESSURE.TO DO SO,SET VENT ISOL
TO CLOSE AND VENT TO OPEN.

DURING THE COUNTDOWN [T-1hr 30 mins] THE CREW COMPARTMENT IS PRESSURIZED
TO ABOUT 16.7 psi TO CHECK FOR LEAKS.

FURTHER REFERENCE:

SEE EMERGENCY EGRESS.

AUXILLARY POWER UNITS:

THE AUXILLARY POWER UNIT IS A HYDRAZINE FUELLED,TURBINE DRIVEN POWER
UNIT THAT GENERATES MACHANICAL SHAFT POWER TO DRIVE A HYDRAULIC PUMP
THAT PRODUCES PRESSURE FOR THE ORBITERS HYDRAULIC SYSTEM.THERE ARE 
THREE AUXILLARY POWER UNITS [APUs],FOR THE THREE HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS,
ALL HOUSED IN THE AFT FUSELAGE,PROVIDING THE HYDRAULIC POWER TO CONTROL
ENGINE GIMBAL ACTUATORS,PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT CONTROL VALVES,ELEVONS,
RUDDER,LANDING AND STEERING GEAR AND SO ON.

THE APUs ARE READIED AT ABOUT T-SIX MINUTES AND STARTED ABOUT FIVE 
MINUTES BEFORE LAUNCH AND REMAIN ACTIVE UNTIL AFTER THE FIRST OMS
BURN.THEY ARE NOT OPERATED AFTER THIS FIRST OMS THRUSTING PERIOD 
BECAUSE HYDRAULIC POWER IS NO LONGER REQUIRED.ONE OF THE UNITS IS RE-
ACTIVATED AGAIN ABOUT A DAY BEFORE DE-ORBIT TO SUPPORT CHECKOUT OF THE
ORBITER FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM ELEVONS,RUDDER/SPEED BRAKE,BODY FLAP,AND
ALL OTHER ORBITER AEROSURFACES.

EACH APU HAS ITS OWN CONTROLLER.BEFORE STARTING UP THE APUs,ALL THE 
BOILER,HYDRAULICS AND FUEL VALVES AND SWITCHES HAVE TO BE SET TO THEIR
CORRECT POSITIONS.ONCE THIS HAS ALL BEEN DONE,THE APUs CAN THEN BE  
STARTED UP.TO DO SO,FIRST SET THE APU CNTRL PWR SWITCHES TO ON ON PANEL
R2.WHEN THE APUs ARE READY TO START,THE READY TO START INDICATORS SIGNAL
GRAY.NOW START THE APUs BY SWITCHING THE APU OPERATE SWITCHES TO START/
RUN.FOR FULL DETAILS OF APU START UP,SEE MISSION PROFILES AT THE END
OF THIS MANUAL.

THE APUs CAN BE RUN AT THREE SPEEDS:LOW,NORMAL AND HIGH.THESE CNA BE
SET USING THE APU SPEED SELECT SWITCHES.WHEN THE APU AUTO SHUTDOWN
SWITCHES ARE AT ENABLE,THE CONTROLLERS WILL AUTOMATICALLY SHUTDOWN 
THE APUs IF AN OVERSPEED [>92880 rpm] OR UNDERSPEED [<57600 rpm]
CONDITION OCCURS,LIGHTING THE APPROPRIATE LIGHT ON PANEL F7.LOSS OF
AN APU WILL CAUSE THE CORRESPONDING HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS TO BECOME
INOPERATIVE LIGHTING THE HYD PRESS LIGHT ON PANEL F7.

THE APUs CAN BE RUN IN CONTINGENCY SITUATIONS OUTSIDE THEIR TOLERANCES
BY SETTING THE AUTO SHUTDOWN TO INHIBIT [PANEL R2] AND SETTING THE APU
OPERATE SWITCHES TO START ORIDE/RUN.IF THE APU OIL TEMPRATURE EXCEEDS
290F THE APU TEMP LIGHT APPEARS ON PANEL F7.THE GENERAL APU STATUS CAN
BE MONITORED ON THE GAUGES ON PANEL F8.

MAIN PROPULSION SYSTEM:

THE MAIN PROPULSION SYSTEM [MPS] CONSISTS OF THE THREE MAIN ENGINES 
[SSMEs],THE EXTERNAL TANK [ET] AND THE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
THE SSMEs CAN BE GIMBALLED UP TO 10.5 DEGREES UNDER THE CONTROL OF 
HYDRAULIC ACTUATORS.

DURING THE LAUNCH PHASE,THE MPS IS ALSO ASSISTED BY THE TWO SOLID
ROCKET BOOSTERS,OR SRBs [SEE BELOW].

THE SSMEs CAN BE CONTROLLED FROM 65% TO 100% OF THEIR RATED POWER LEVEL
[100% REPRESENTS 375,000 POUNDS OF THRUST AT LAUNCH] BY USE OF THE 
SPEED BRAKE/THROTTLE.THE ENGINES ARE CONTROLLED BY THEIR OWN INDIBIDUAL
COMPUTERS [CALLED CONTROLLERS] RECEIVING COMMANDS FROM THE MAIN SHUTTLE
GENERAL PURPOSE COMPUTERS [GPCs].

CONTROLLERS AND SUPPORT CIRCUITS ARE ENABLED BY THE SWITCHES ON PANEL
R2.

THE HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN PROPELLANTS ARE HELIUM PRESSURIZED THROUGH THE 
PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.THE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS COMPLEX
AND USUALLY CONTROLLED BY COMPUTER,THE CONTROL SWITCHES BEING SET TO
GPC.IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS,USUALLY ABORTS,THE CREW CAN CARRY OUT MANY
OPERATIONS USING MANUAL SWITCHES ON PANEL R2.THE PROPELLANT MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM PRESSURES ARE SHOWN ON GAUGES ON PANEL F7.

THE ORBITER HAS THREE HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS FOR PROVIDING THRUST VECTOR 
CONTROL AND ACTUATING ENGINE VALVES.THE MAIN DISTRIBUTION VALVES ARE
CONTROLLED BY THE HYDRAULICS MPS/TVC 1/2 AND 3 SWITCHES ON PANEL R4.
THE TALKBACK INDICATORS SHOW OP OR CL ACCORDINGLY.

IN EMERGENCIES,[AND AFTER GPC CONTROL HAS FAILED] FUEL CAN BE DUMPED
BY SETTING THE MPS PRPLT DUMP SWITCH ON PANEL R2 TO SEQUENCE START.

THE HYDRAULIC MPS/TVC ISOL VALVE SWITCHES ON PANEL R4 ARE CLOSED ON 
ORBIT TO PROTECT AGAINST HYDRAULIC LEAKS.

FURTHER REFERENCE:

FOR CONTROLS REQUIRED FOR PRESSURIZATION SYSTEM,SEE APPROPRIATE
SECTION OF MISSION PROCEDURES.

SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS [SRBs]:

THE TWO SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS [SRBs] ARE ATTACHED ON EACH SIDE OF THE
EXTERNAL TANK [ET].THEY ARE EACH 149.16 FEET LONG AND 12.17 FEET IN
DIAMETER AND WEIGH ABOUT 1,300,000 POUNDS AT LAUNCH INCLUDING THEIR
LOAD OF ABOUT 1,100,000 POUNDS OF PROPELLANT.EACH SRB DEVELOPS 
APPROXIMETELY 3,300,000 POUNDS THRUST AT LAUNCH,PROVIDINNG NEARLY   
THREE QUARTERS OF THE SHUTTLES INITIAL THRUST.THE PRECISE DIRECTION 
OF THRUST CAN BE ADJUSTED BY GIBALLING THE ROCKET NOZZLE USING
ACTUATORS POWERED BY TWO HYDRAULIC POWER UNITS [HPUs].

SRB IGNITION TAKES PLACE A FRACTION OF A SECOND BEFORE LAUNCH AFTER 
THE SUCCESSFUL STARTING OF THE MAIN ENGINES.

ABOUT 2 MINUTES AFTER LAUNCH 4 SEPERATION MOTERS FIRE TO SEPARATE THE
SRBs FROM THE ET.THE SRBs CONTINUE TO RISE AFTER SEPARATION TO NEARLY
220,000 FEET BEFORE FALLING TO AROUND 15,700 FEET WHEN PARACHUTES ARE
DEPLOYED.THE SRBs ARE RECOVERED FROM THE OCEAN APPROXIMATELY 122 NAUTICAL
MILES FROM THE LAUNCH SITE.

SEPARATION IS CONTROLLED BY THE SRB SEPARATION AUTO/MAN SWITCH ON PANEL
C3 AND THE SEP PUSH BUTTON.IN THE AUTO POSITION THE GPCs DO THE SEPARATION.
TO MANUALLY JETTISON THE SRBs,SELECT MAN AND PRESS THE SEP BUTTON.

EXTERNAL TANK:

THE EXTERNAL TANK [ET] CONTAINS THE LIQUID HYDROGEN AND LIQUID OXYGEN
PROPELLANT TO FUEL THE MAIN ENGINES DURING ASCENT.THE ET IS 153.8 FEET
LONG AND 27.6 FEET IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHS AROUND 1,655,600 POUNDS AT
LAUNCH INCLUDING ABOUT 1,589,600 POUNDS OF PROPELLANT.

THE CONNECTIONS GO FROM ET TO ORBITER THROUGH THE ET UMBILICAL DISCONNECT
CAVITIES,AREAS OF THE ORBITERS SURFACE THAT HOUSE ALL THE FUEL LINES
AND MECHANICAL DISCONNECT SYSTEMS THAT MAINTAIN THE ET/ORBITER 
CONNECTIONS.

THE ET IS JETTISONED IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAIN ENGINE CUTOFF [MECO] AND
BREAKS UP IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE BEFORE FALLING INTO THE OCEAN.IT IS
SEPARATED FROM THE ORBITER AT THREE STRUCTURAL ATTACH POINTS,SEPARATION
OCCURING BEFORE ORBIT INSERTION,NORMALLY UNDER AUTOMATIC CONTROL.

SEPARATION IS CONTROLLED BY THE ET SEPARATON AUTO/MAN SWITCH ON PANEL C3
AND THE SEP PUSH BUTTON.IN THE AUTO POSITION THE GPCs DO THE SEPARATION.
TO MANUALLY JETTISON THE ET,SELECT MAN AND PRESS THE SEP BUTTON.

NOTE:

THE UMBILICAL DOORS MUST BE CLOSED AFTER ET SEP.THIS IS NORMALLY DONE
AUTOMATICALLY BY GPC.OPTIONALLY,OR IN CONTINGENCY CONDITIONS,THIS CAN
BE DONE BY THE CREW,THIS IS DONE BY ENSURING THAT THE ET UMBILICAL 
DOOR CENTRELINE LATCH SWITCH ON PANEL R2 IS IN THE STOW POSITION,
SETTING THE ET UMBILICAL DOOR LEFT AND RIGHT LATCH SWITCHES TO RELEASE
[TAKES ABOUT 6 SECONDS TO UNLATCH] AND SETTING THE ET UMBILICAL DOOR
LEFT AND RIGHT DOOR OPEN/OFF/CLOSE SWITCHES TO CLOSE [TAKES ABOUT 24
SECONDS].THE LATCH TALKBACK INDICATORS SHOW LAT OR REL AND THE DOOR 
INDICATORS SHOW OP OF CL,BOTH SHOWING BARBERPOLE WHEN THE DOORS/
LATCHES ARE IN TRANSIT.

THE UMBILICAL DOORS ARE NORMALLY CLOSED AUTOMATICALLY IN RTLS 
ABORTS [DEFAULT POSITION IS GPC].

GUIDENCE,NAVIGATION AND CONTROL:

GUIDENCE,NAVIGATION AND CONTROL [GNC,OR SOMETIMES GN&C] OF THE SPACE
SHUTTLE IS CARRIED OUT WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE FOUR MAIN GPCs OR THE
BFS IN CONTINGENCY SITUATIONS.GNC HAS TWO OPERATING MODES: AUTOMATIC
MODE IN WHICH THE GPCs EFFECTIVELY FLY THE COMPUTER WITH THE FLIGHT
CREW SELECTING THE OPERATING SEQUENCES VIA THE COMPUTER KEYPADS,AND
MANUAL MODE,IN WHICH THE CREW FLIES THE ORBITER USING THE ROTATIONAL
CONTROLLER,TRANSLATIONAL CONTROLLER,THRUST CONTROLLER AND RUDDER
PEDALS,ETC.

THE ORBITER HAS SEVERAL NAVIGATION AIDS WHICH HELP COMPUTE ITS POSITION.
THERE ARE THREE INERTIAL MEASUREMENT UNITS [IMUs] WHICH MEASURE CHANGES
IN THE ORBITERS ATTITUDE AND VELOCITY.THE IMUs ARE NORMALLY POWERED UP 
AND IN OPERATION BY THE TIME THE CREW ENTER THE ORBITER BEFORE LAUNCH.
THE IMUs DRIFT WITH TIME AND ARE REGULARLY RECALIBRATED USING THE STAR
TRACKERS WHICH CAD FIX THE ORBITERS POSITION BY ANGULAR COMPARISONS 
TO KNOWN REFERENCE STARS.IN ADDITION THE STAR TRACKERS CAN BE USED TO
GIVE ANGULAR INFORMATION FROM THE ORBITER TO A TARGET IN ORBIT.THE
CREWMAN OPTICAL ALIGNMENT SIGHT IS A BACKUP TO THE STAR TRACKERS.

INFORMATION FROM THE IMUs IS USED TO FEED THE ACCELERATION AND RATE
INDICATORS ON PANELS F6 AND F8.

TACAN:

APPROACH AND LANDING SYSTEMS USE THE GROUND BASED TACTICAL AIR NAVIGATION
SYSTEM [TACAN],USED THE WORLD OVER BY COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT.
THIS SYSTEM FEEDS TRACK INFORMATION TO THE DIRECTION INDICATORS ON 
PANEL F8 AND F6,AND IS ACTIVATED BY THE OPS PROGRAMS FED INTO THE COMPUTER
BY THE CREW THROUGH THE KEYPAD ON PANEL C2 WHEN ON GPC.THE SPACE SHUTTLE
USES THREE TACAN SYSTEMS FOR THE SAKE OF REDUNDANCY,IE,IN CASE ONE OR
MORE BREAKS DOWN.TACANs MAXIMUM RANGE IS 400 NAUTICAL MILES [460 STATUTORY
MILES].

WITH SO MUCH COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AT THEIR DISPOSAL ITS RARE
FOR THE FLIGHT CREW OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE TO EVER NEED TO TOUCH ANY MANUAL
GUIDANCE CONTROLS,AS THE SHUTTLE CAN LAUNCH,ORBIT,RE-ENTER AND LAND 
ENTIRELY UNDER COMPUTER CONTROL.REGARDLESS,MANY OF THE SHUTTLE FLIGHT
CREWS HAVE STILL CHOSEN TO GUIDE THE ORBITER BY HAND,MOST OFTEN WHEN 
LANDING,AT WHICH TIME THE GUIDENCE COMPUTERS AND DISPLAYS ACT MUCH AS
TRADITIONAL NAVIGATION AIDS TO THE PILOT OR COMMANDER.

IN CONTINGENCY,NAVIGATION SYSTEMS CAN BE SWITCHED ON MANUALLY USING THE
HSI SELECT SWITCHES ON PANELS F6 AND F8.

TACAN MANUAL PROCEDURE:

TACAN 1,2 OR 3 ANT SEL TO AUTO [PANEL O7]
TACAN MODE TO GPC [PANEL O7
HSI SELECT SOURCE TO TACAN [PANEL F6/F8]
HSI SELECT MODE TO TAEM [PANEL F6/F8]

WHEN THE ORBITER HAS TURNED ONTO ITS FINAL LEG FOR LANDING,IT CAN BE
GUIDED BY A MICROWAVE SCAN BEAM LANDING SYSTEM [MSBLS].THIS SYSTEM 
FEEDS THE TRACK AND GLIDESLOPE INDICATORS ON PANELS F6 AND F8.THE 
ORBITER ALSO HAS TWO RADAR ALTIMETERS ON BOARD WHICH FEED INFORMATION
TO THE ALTITUDE INDICATOR ON PANELS F6 AND F8.

FURTHER REFERENCE:

FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF LANDING PROCEDURES,SEE ALSO MISSION PROCEDURES,
RE-ENTRY [MM304] ONWARDS.

2.INSTRUMENTS:

THE MAIN GUIDENCE AND NAVIGATION INSTRUMENTS,DETAILED BELOW,ARE ALL 
LOCATED ON THE COMMANDERS AND PILOTS MAIN PANELS [F6 AND F8].THE
COMMANDER AND PILOT ALSO EACH HAVE A HEAD UP DISPLAY [HUD].

AIR DATA SYSTEM:

THE AIR DATA SYSTEM PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE MOVEMENT AND POSITION
OF THE ORBITER IN RELATION TO THE AIR MASSES AROUND IT,AND RELATES
THIS INFORMATION TO THE AMIs,THE AVVIs AND THE CRTs.FOR INFORMATION
ON THESE DISPLAYS,SEE THE REVELANT SECTIONS.

THIS DATA IS COLLECTED BY THE AIR DATA PROBES,POSITIONED ON THE LEFT
AND RIGHT OF THE ORBITERS NOSE SECTION.THE AIR DATA PROBES ARE DEPLOYED
ONLY DURING THE FINAL DESCENT STAGES WHEN THE ORBITERS VELOCITY DROPS
BELOW MACH 3.

EACH PROBE IS INDEPENDENTLY DEPLOYED BY TWO AC MOTORS,AND IS CONTROLLED
BY ITS AIR DATA PROBE SWITCH [PANEL C3].TO DEPLOY THE PROBES,THE LEFT
AND RIGHT SWITCHES ARE POSITIONED TO DEPLOY.IF THE AIR DATA PROBE 
HEATERS ARE REQUIRED,THE SWITCH IS SET TO DEPLOY/HEAT.WHEN THE PROBE 
IS DEPLOYED,TAKING 15 SECONDS WITH BOTH MOTERS 30 WITH ONE.

TO STOW THE HEATERS,NORMALLY ONLY DONE WHEN THE ORBITER IS ON THE GROUND,
THE AIR DATA PROBE STOW LEFT AND RIGHT SWITCHES [PANEL C3] ARE SWITCHED
TO ENABLE,THEN THE AIR DATA PROBE SWITCHES ARE SWITCHED TO STOW,STOWING
THE PROBES.IF THE AIR DATA PROBE STOW SWITCH IS SET AT INHIBIT,THE PROBES
CANNOT BE STOWED AS THE AC MOTOR CIRCUITS ARE DISABLED,THUS SAVING THE
MICROSWITCHES.

PROBLEMS:

THE ONLY PROBLEM COMES WHEN NEITHER OF THE PROBES WORK,THIS MEANS THAT
NONE OF THE DESCENT RELATED SWITCHES MENTIONED ABOVE,AND DETAILED BELOW,
WILL WORK EITHER,SHOWING A RED FLAG ACROSS THEM.IF THIS OCCURS,WHICH 
IT HAS NEVER DONE SO FAR,THEN THE PILOT NO CHOICE BUT TO GUIDE THE 
ORBITER INTO LAND AS BEST HE CAN.

RADAR ALTIMETER:

THE SPACE SHUTTLES TWO RADAR ALTIMETERS MEASURE THE ABSOLUTE DISTANCE
FROM THE ORBITER TO THE GROUND,AND ENABLE THE INSTRUMENTS TO SHOW NOT
ONLY THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY BELOW,BUT ANY FEATURES,CLIFS,MOUNTAINS ETC,
TO THE FRONT OR AFT,OR TO EITHER SIDE OF THE CRAFT.THE TWO SYSTEMS CAN
OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER,BUT IF THEY ARE USED TOGETHER,THEY
PRESENT TO THE INSTRUMENTS AN AVERAGED READING OF THE TERRAIN BELOW.

THIS FACILITY IS AVAILABLE AT ANY ALTITUDE FROM ZERO TO 5000 ft.,
BUT HAS A TENDENCY NOT TO WORK IF THE ORBITER IS PITCHING OR ROLLING
TO GREATLY.

THE RADAR ALTIMETER CAN BE ACCESSED BY EITHER THE COMMANDER OR THE 
PILOT,FOR DISPLAY ON THEIR RESPECTIVE AVVI.THE COMMANDER USES RADAR
ALTM 1/2 SWITCH [PANEL F7],AND THE PILOTS BEING ON [PANEL F8].HOWEVER
BEFORE THE ALTIMETER CAN BE USED,THE POWER TO THE SWITCHES MUST BE  
SWITCHED ON,USING THE RADAR ALTIMETER ON/OFF 1/2 SWITCH [PANEL O8].

PROBLEMS:

THE RADAR ALTIMETER GAUGE WILL SHOW A RED OFF FLAG IF THERE IS A LOSS
OF POWER,LOSS OF LOCK,BAD DATA OR THREE COMMUNICATIONS FAULTS.IN THIS
CASE,THE RADAR ALTIMETER WONT WORK,AND THE CREW HAVE TO RELY UPON THEIR
REMAINING INSTRUMENTS,AND IN A WORST CASE SCENARIO,ON THEIR JUDGEMENT.

ATTITUDE DIRECTION INDICATOR:

THE ATTIDUDE DIRECTION INDICATORS [ADIs],THE UPPERMOST OF THE TWO
INDICATORS ON PANELS F6 AND F8,ARE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE MISSION.
THERE IS AN AFT ADI ON PANEL A1 ACTIVE DURING THE ORBIT PHASE.THE 
INSTRUMENT IS SIMILAR TO THE ARTIFICIAL HORIZON FOUND IN A CONVENTIONAL
AIRCRAFT,AND SHOWS THE ORBITERS ATTITUDE.

HORIZONTAL SITUATION INDICATOR:

THE HORIZONTAL SITUATION INDICATORS [HSIs],BENEATH THE ADIs,ARE ACTIVE
DURING RE-ENTRY AND LANDING [AND RTLS].THE HSIs SHOW THE ORBITERS DIRECTION
AND POSITION RELATIVE TO THE REQUIRED TRACK AND GLIDESLOPE.

ALTITUDE AND VERTICAL VELOCITY INDICATOR:

THE ALTITUDE AND VERTICAL VELOCITY INDICATORS [AVVIs PANELS F6/F8],SHOW
THE VERTICAL ACCELERATION [ALT ACCEL],THE VERTICAL VELOCITY [ALT RATE],
THE ALTITUDE AS GIVEN BY A BAROMETRIC ALTIMETER [ALT],AND THE ALTITUDE
AS GIVEN BY A RADAR ALTIMETER [RDR ALT].

PROBLEMS:

AN RA OFF FLAG COMES ACROSS THE RDR ALT GAUGE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

1] RA ON/OFF SWITCH ON PANEL O8 IS TURNED OFF.

2] LOSS OF POWER DUE TO TOO MUCH PITCH AND/OR ROLL.

3] LOSS OF POWER DUE TO BAD DATA.

TO RECTIFY,CORRECT WHICHEVER CONTINGENCY HAS GONE WRONG.

THE SOURCE OF INFORMAATION FOR THE AMI IS EITHER FROM THE NAVIGATION
SOFTWARE OR FROM LEFT OR RIGHT AIR DATA PROBES,AS DETERMINED BY THE 
SETTING OF THE AIR DATA SWITCHES ON PANEL F6.THE TWO UNITS ARE DRIVEN
INDEPENDENTLY,BUT CAN HAVE THE SAME INFORMATION DISPLAYED ON BOTH,OR
NOT,AS THE CASE MAY BE.

SURFACE POSITION INDICATORS:

THE SURFACE POSITION INDICATORS [SPIs PANEL F7],ACTIVE DURING ENTRY 
[AND RTLS] SHOW THE ACTUAL AND COMMANDED SETTINGS OF THE ORBITER AIR
SURFACES: RUDDER,AILERON,ELEVONS AND BODY FLAPS.

RCS COMMAND LIGHTS:

THESE INDICATORS [PANEL F6],ACTIVE DURING ENTRY AND RTLS,ILLUMINATE 
TO SHOW WHEN THE RCS JETS FOR PITCH,ROLL AND YAW ARE BEING USED OR 
WHEN THE AIR SURFACES ARE IMPARTING SIMILAR EFFECTS TO THE ORBITER. 
ONCE THE RESPECTIVE DYNAMIC PRESSURES ARE ACHIEVED [10 psf FOR ROLL 
JETS,20 FOR PITCH:YAW LIGHTS CONTINUE TO FUNCTION UNTIL MACH 1],THE
LIGHTS ARE NOT USED AGAIN UNTIL DYNAMIC PRESSURE REACHES 50 pfs.AT 
THIS POINT,BOTH PITCH AND ROLL LIGHTS ASSUME A NEW FUNCTION,ILLUMINATING
WHENEVER THE ELEVON SURFACE DRIVE RATE EXCEEDS 20 DEGREES PER SECOND
[OR 10 IF ONLY ONE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM IS LEFT].

G FORCE METER:

THIS GAUGE,LOCATED ON PANEL F7,SHOWS THE G FORCES ACTING ON THE SHUTTLE
AND CREW.

HEAD UP DISPLAY:

THE HEADS UP DISPLAYS [HUDs] WORK IN A SIMILAR WAY TO THOSE ON MODERN
JET PLANES,CONVAYING CRUCIAL INSTRUMENT READINGS TO THE PILOT SO THAT
HE DOES NOT HAVE TO LOOK DOWN AT THE INSTRUMENT PANELS DURING THE FINAL
APPROACH.

DIGITAL AUTO PILOT:

THE SHUTTLE IS NORMALLY CONTROLLED ALMOST ENTIRELY BY THE FOUR MAIN 
GPCs FROM A COMBINATION OF PRE-PROGRAMMED SEQUENCES.SOME OF THESE 
SEQUENCES ARE ACTIVATED AUTOMATICALLY,WHILE SOME ARE CONTROLLED BY
THE CREW VIA THE KEYPADS.THE HEART OF THE FLIGHT CONTROL SOFTWARE IS
THE DIGITAL AUTOPILOT [DAP].DURING THE ASCENT PHASE [OPS 1] THE DAP 
WILL NORMALLY CONTROL ENGINE THROTTLE AND VECTOR TRANSITIONS,SRB AND
ET SEPARATION,MECO AND ORBIT INSERTION.RTLS CONTROL [OPS 6] IS AVAILABLE
AS AN OVERLAY TO OPS 1 AS THERE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TIME TO LOAD OPS 6
SEPARATELY.DURING THE MAIN MISSION [ORBIT] PHASE [OPS 2],THE DAP CONTROLS
THE RCS ENGINES AS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ORBIT REGULARITY AND SHUTTLE
ATTITUDE AND TO ADJUST THE ORBIT TO RENDEZVOUS WITH TARGETS.DURING THE RE-
ENTRY PHASE [OPS 3],THE DAP CONTROLS THE DE-ORBIT BURN,RE-ENTRY ATTITUDE
AND SPEED CONTROL,AND LANDING.

BY SWITCHING ON THE ORBITAL DAP MAN SWITCH ON PANEL C3,THE COMMANDER
AND PILOT CAN OVERRIDE THE DAP IF THEY WISH TO HAVE MANUAL CONTROL OR
IN A CONTINGENCY SITUATION.NOTE THAT THE ORBITER IS FLY BY WIRE SO 
EVEN WHEN UNDER MANUAL CONTROL,THE MANUAL COMMANDS ARE STILL PROCESSED
BY THE COMPUTER.

ROTATIONAL HAND CONTROLLERS:

THERE ARE THREE ROTATIONAL HAND CONTROLLERS [RHCs],ONE EACH AT THE 
COMMANDERS AND PILOTS STATIONS,AND ONE AT THE AFT STATION.THE ACTION
OF THE CONTROLLERS DEPENDS ON THE PHASE OF THE MISSION.DURING THE ASCENT
STAGE,THE RHCs GIMBALL THE AAMEs AND SRB ENGINES.FOR ORBIT INSERTION
AND DE-ORBIT THEY GIMBALL THE OMS ENGINES AND CONTROL THRUSTING OF THE
RCS ENGINES.WHILE IN ORBIT THEY CONTROL THE RCS ENGINE THRUSTING.DURING
THE FIRST PART OF RE-ENTRY THEY CONTROL RCS THRUSTING AND,LATER ON,THE
ELEVON POSITIONS.DURING ORBIT,THE CONTROL IS 3 AXIS [PITCH,ROLL AND 
YAW].DURING ASCENT,RE-ENTRY AND LANDING THE CONTROL IS ONLY 2 AXIS 
[PITCH AND ROLL].

RHC/PANEL ENABLE/INHIBIT:

IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MANUALLY CONTROL THE MOVEMENTS OF THE SHUTTLE
WHILE UNDER NOMINAL GPC CONTROL,THE CREW MUST FIRST SWITCH ON THEIR
RHCs.

SWITCH THE RHC/PANEL SWITCH FROM INHIBIT,WHEREIN NO RHC COMMANDS WILL
EFFECT THE SHUTTLE,TO ENABLE,WHERE THEY WILL.BOTH THE COMMANDER AND 
PILOT CAN ENABLE THEIR RHCs,AND AS A FAILSAFE,IF THEY PULL IN OPPOSITE
DIRECTIONS,ANY SUCH CONTRARY INSTRUCTIONS WILL CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

TRANSLATIONAL HAND CONTRLLERS:

THERE ARE TWO TRANSLATIONAL HAND CONTROLLERS [THCs].ONE IS AT THE 
COMMANDERS STATION AND THE OTHER IS AT THE AFT STATION.THE COMMANDERS
THC IS ACTIVE DURING ORBIT INSETION,ORBIT AND DE-ORBIT.THE AFT THC IS
ONLY ACTIVE DURING ORBIT.THE THCs ARE USED TO CONTROL THE RCS ENGINES
[THIS IS INDEPENDENT OF THE PUSH BUTTON CONTROLS ON PANELS C3 AND A6].

RUDDER PEDALS:

THE COMMANDER AND PILOT HAVE AIRCRAFT-STYLE RUDDER PEDALS WHICH CONTROL
THE ORBITER IN THE YAW AXIS DURING FLIGHT WITHIN THE ATMOSPHERE FURTHER-
MORE,THE PEDALS ALSO OPERATE THE NOSE WHEEL STEERING,WHILE DEPRESSING
THE TOP OF THE PEDALS PROVIDES BRAKING TO BOTH THE MAIN AND THE NOSE
WHEELS.

THRUST AND BRAKING:

THE COMMANDER AND PILOT EACH HAVE SPEED BRAKE AND THRUST CONTROLLERS
WHICH ALLOW THEM TO CONTROL THRUST DURING THE ASCENT STAGE [BY VARYING
THE THRUST FROM THE MAIN ENGINES] AND AIRSPEED DURING LANDING [BY OPENING
THE TAIL SPEED BRAKE].

BODY FLAP:

THERE ARE TWO BODY FLAP SWITCHES,ONE FOR THE COMMANDER ON PANEL L2, 
AND ONE FOR THE PILOT ON PANEL C3.THE SWITCHES ALLOW THE CREW TO    
MOVE THE BODY FLAPS MANUALLY EITHER FOR SSME THERAML PROTECTION OR 
REDUCING ELEVON DEFLECTIONS DURING ENTRY PHASE.EACH SWITCH IS SPRING
LOADED TO RETURN TO THE CENTRE POSITION,AND THE OTHER POSITIONS ARE
MOMENTARY ONES.FOR EXAMPLE,THE CREW HAVE TO HOLD THE SWITCH IN POSITION
TO MOVE THE BODY FLAPS UP OR DOWN.

TO RELEASE THE SWITCH FROM AUTOMATIC,SIMPLY MOVE IT TO EITHER UP OR 
DOWN POSITIONS,WHILE IN MANUAL,THE WHITE LIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
BODY FLAP MAN/AUTO SWITCH ON PANEL F2/F4 WILL BE ILLUMINATED.TO RETURN
IT TO AUTO,PRESS THIS BODY FLAP SWITCH AND THE AUTO LIGHT WILL 
ILLUMINATE.

2 ON ORBIT MANEUVERS:

ALL OF THE MAJOR GNC TASKS ARE CARRIED OUT ONCE IN ORBIT UNDER THE OPS2
SOFTWARE.THIS IS SUBDIVIDED INTO THE ORBIT COAST,MM201,IN WHICH THE 
MAJORITY OF ORBITAL TASKS ARE CARRIED OUT INCLUDING ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENTS,
AND THE MANEUVER/EXECUTE IN WHICH OMS TRANSLATIONS ARE MADE.

BEFORE DE-ORBIT,OPS 8 [MM801] CAN BE USED TO CHECK OUT ALL SYSTEMS,
INCLUDING THE GIMBALLING OF THE ENGINE NOZZLES,MOVEMENT OF AERO SURFACES,
CHECKING OF VALVES AND HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS,AND INSTRUMENTATION.

ORBITER:

THE SPACE SHUTTLE ORBITERS,OF WHICH THERE HAVE BEEN 5 [ENTERPRISE,
COLUMBIA,CHALLENGER,ATLANTIS AND DISCOVERY] HAVE A TYPICAL LENGTH OF
122.2 FEET AND A WINGSPAN OF 78.06 FEET.

THE PRESSURIZED CREW COMPARTMENT IS IN THE FORWARD FUSELAGE JUST BEHIND
FORWARD REACTION CONTROL SYSTEM [RCS].THE MAIN BODY OF THE ORBITER IS
TAKEN UP BY THE PAYLOAD BAY,WHICH IS 60 FEET LONG.

THE REAR OF THE ORBITER HOUSES THE SPACE SHUTTLE MAIN ENGINES [SSMEs],
AND THE ORBITAL MANEUVERING SYSTEM [OMS],AS WELL AS THE AFT RCS PODS.

THE ORBITER STRUCTURE IS BUILT MAINLY OF ALUMINIUM ALLOY COVERED WITH
THE NOW LEGENDARY RE-USABLE INSULATION TILES.

FURTHER REFERENCE:

FOR MORE DETAILS,SEE INDIVIDUAL SECTIONS.

CREW COMPARTMENT:

THE CREW COMPARTMENT IS A SEALED PRESSURE TIGHT THREE LEVEL CABIN OF
ABOUT 2325 CUBIC FEET.IT IS MOUNTED INSIDE THE FORWARD FUSELAGE AT THE
FRONT OF THE ORBITER.ENTRY TO THE ORBITER IS THROUGH THE SIDE HATCH 
TO THE MID DECK,OR THE AIRLOCK TO THE PAYLOAD BAY.THE SIDE HATCH CAN
BE JETTISONED IN EMERGENCIES.

THE COMPARTMENT WOULD NORMALLY ACCOMMODATE FOUR CREW MEMBERS ON THE FLIGHT
DECK AND UP TO FOUR ON THE MID DECK.A FURTHER TWO CREW MEMBERS COULD
BE CARRIED IN EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.THE LOWER TIER OF THE COMPARTMENT
SERVES AS AN EQUIPMENT BAY.

THE FLIGHT DECK CONTAINS ALL OF THE CRAFTS FLIGHT AND PAYLOAD CONTOLS
AND INSTRUMENTATION.

AIRLOCK:

THE AIRLOCK IS LOCATED IN THE MID DECK OF THE CREW COMPARTMENT LEADING
TO THE PAYLOAD BAY.IT WILL ACCOMMODATE TWO ASTRONAUTS SUITED IN EXTRA
VEHICULAR MOBILITY UNITS [EMUs].AIRLOCK PRESSURIZATION CAN BE CONTROLLED
FROM THE MID DECK OR FROM INSIDE THE AIRLOCK ITSELF.EMUs PROVIDE LIFE 
SUPPORT FOR UP TO 7 HOURS WITH A 30 MINUTE EMERGENCY BACKUP.

PAYLOAD BAY:

THE PAYLOAD BAY IS APPROXIMATELY 60 FEET LONG.THE DOORS PROVIDE A FAIRLY
AIRTIGHT SEAL AND PROTECTION TO PAYLOADS DURING ASCENT AND RETURN.ONCE
IN ORBIT,THE PAYLOAD BAY DOORS ARE OPENED TO ALLOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL
CONTROL RADIATORS TO BE DEPLOYED TO DISPERSE HEAT.

NORMALLY THE CONTROL SEQUENCE FOR OPENING AND CLOSING THE PAYLOAD BAY
DOOR BULKHEAD LATCHES,CENTRELINE LATCHES AND PAYLOAD BAY DOORS IS THROUGH
THE ORBITERS KEYPAD,USING PRE-DETERMINED PROGRAMS TO OPEN AND/OR CLOSE
THE DOORS IN SEQUENCE.

REMOTE MANIPULATOR SYSTEM:

THE REMOTE MANIPULATOR SYSTEM [RMS] MAIN COMPONANT IS THE MANIPULATOR
ARM WHICH CAN EITHER MANEUVER A PAYLOAD FROM THE PAYLOAD BAY FOR DEPLOYMENT
OR CAPTURE AND RETRIEVE A FREE FLYING OBJECT:NOT ALL PAYLOADS NEED THE
RMS FOR DEPLOYMENT OR RETRIEVAL,HOWEVER.

THE ARM IS INSTALLED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PAYLOAD BAY AND IS CONNECTED
TO A CONTROL PANEL AND ROTATIONAL AND TRANSLATIONAL CONTROLLERS AT THE
FLIGHT DECK AFT STATION.NORMALLY,THE ARM IS CONTROLLED BY ONE CREW MEMBER
LOOKING THROUGH THE AFT WINDOWS ASSISTED BY A SECOND CREW MEMBER CONTROLLING
THE CLOSED CIRCUIT MONITORS.

THE MANIPULATOR ARM IS 50.25 FEET LONG AND 15 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND 
WEIGHS 905 POUNDS.IT HAS SIX JOINTS,GIVING IT SIX DEGREES OF FREEDOM.
ITS JOINTS ARE ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO HUMAN JOINTS WITH A SHOULDER,
[YAW AND PITCH],ELBOW [PITCH],AND WRIST [ROLL YAW AND PITCH].AT THE
END OF THE ARM IS THE END EFFECTOR,USED TO GRAB THE PAYLOADS.

THE ARM IS NORMALLY INSTALLED ON THE LEFT [PORT] OF THE PAYLOAD BAY 
BUT CAN BE INSTALLED ON THE RIGHT [STARBOARD],2 ARMS CAN BE INSTALLED
IF NECCESSARY BUT ONLY ONE CAN BE CONTROLLED AT A TIME.

STANDARD END EFFECTOR:

THE STANDARD END EFFECTOR IS THE RMSs EQUIVALENT OF A HAND.IT IS A HOLLOW
CANISTER CONTAINING THREE CABLES WHICH ACT AS A SNARE TO PAYLOADS WHICH
HAVE SPECIAL GRAPPLE FITTINGS.

THE END EFFECTOR SNARE MECHANISM CAN BE EXTENDED TO THE OPEN END OF THE
CANISTER,ROTATED AND CLOSED TO CAPTURE THE PAYLOAD AND/OR WITHDRAWN 
TO RIGIDIZE THE PAYLOAD.THE INDICATORS ON PANEL A8U SHOW THE STATE OF
THE END EFFECTOR.THE SNARE MECHANISM IS OPENED OR CLOSED BY THE CAPTURE/
RELEASE BUTTON ON THE AFT ROTATIONAL CONTROLLER.DEPENDANT ON THE MODE
SWITCH,THE SNARE CAN BE MADE RIGID AUTOMATICALLY ONCE THE SNARE HAS 
BEEN CLOSED OR MANUALLY BY USE OF THE MAN/CONTR SWITCH.

THE ARM CAN BE CONTROLLED WITH PRE-PROGRAMMED COMPUTER INSTRUCTIONS 
BY SETTING THE ROTARY MODE SWITCH ON PANEL A8U TO AUTO 1,2,3,4 OR OPR
CMD,AND PRESSING ENTER.THE PRE-PROGRAMMED OPERATIONS ARE THEN CARRIED
OUT.

PRE-PROGRAMMED OPERATIONS CAN BE STARTED,INTERRUPTED AND RESTARTED BY
MOMENTARY USE OF THE USE OF THE AUTOSEQ PROCEED/STOP SWITCH,OR MANAUALLY
BY USING THE [AND] KEYS ON YOUR KEYBOARB.USING THESE IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH THE ALT KEY MOVES IT IN FINE STEPS.

ALTERNATIVELY,THE ARM CAN BE CONTROLLED BY SETTING THE ROTARY CONTROL
TO SINGLE,PRESSING ENTER,AND THEN CONTROLLING THE JIONT INDICATED ON
THE JOINT ROTARY SWITCH USING THE SINGLE/DIRECT DRIVE +/- SWITCH.THE 
DIRECT SETTING IS A CONTINGENCY MODE WHICH BY PASSES THE COMPUTER
INTERVENTION WHICH NORMALLY ENSURES WITHIN LIMIT CONTROL OF THE ARM.
THE RMS STATUS IS SHOWN ON THE CRT AND THE ILLUMINATED INDICATORS ON
PANEL A8U.

THE BACKUP PANEL IS A DOWNGRADED CONTROL SYSTEM TO USE IF THE PRIMARY
CIRCUITS HAVE FAILED.IT IS ACTIVATED BY SETTING THE RMS POWER SWITCH
ONPANEL A8L TO BACKUP.THE PAYLOAD CAN BE RELEASED IN EMERGENCY BY USE
OF THE BACKUP PAYLOAD RELEASE SWITCH ON PANEL A8U.IN THE EVENT OF AN 
EMERGENCY,IN WHICH THE RMS ARM CANNOT BE STOWED,AND THUS THE PAYLOAD 
BAY DOORS CANNOT BE CLOSED,THE RMS ARM CAN BE JETTISONED.THERE ARE  
FOUR SEPARATE POINTS ON THE ARM,AND ALL OF THEM ARE JETTISONED 
INDIVIDUALLY,USING THE SWITCHES ON PANEL A14.

JETTISONING THE ARM:

TO RELEASE THE ARM,FIRST POSITION THE RMS JETT DEADFACE SWITCH TO DEADFACE
IN ORDER TO KILL THE ELECTRONICS IN THE RETENSION LATCHES,THEN POSITION
THE REVEVANT PYRO RMS ARM SWITCH TO GUILLOTINE,ARMING THE JETTISON  
CIRCUITS.POSITIONING THE RMS JETT SWITCH TO GUILLOTINE CUTS THROUGH 
THE WIRE BUNDLES IN THE ARM.THEN POSITION THE TWO SWITCHES TO JETT,
AND THE CORRESPONDING ARM SHOULDER JOINT IS JETTISONED.

FINALLY,POSITION THE PYRO RETENSION LATCHES AFT,MID,FWD SWITCHES TO 
GUILLOTINE AND THEN TO JETT,AND THE RESPECTIVE RETENSION LATCHES ARE
ALSO JETTISONED.

EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THOSE USING THE PAYLOAD ASSIST MODULE [PAM], 
PAYLOADS ARE NORMALLY LATCHED INTO THE PAYLOAD BAY ITSELF.THE PAYLOADS
ARE UNLATCHED BY USING THE PL SELECT ROTARY SWITCH ON PANEL A6 [NUMBERED
1-5,EACH NUMBER RELATING TO A PAYLOAD],AND RELEASING THE LATCHES USING
THE WELL NAMED LATCH RELEASE SWITCH.THE INDICATOR [ONE OF THREE] ABOVE
THE SWITCH SHOWS LAT WHEN THE PAYLOAD IS LATCHED AND REL WHEN THE LATCHES
ARE FULLY RELEASED.LATCHING OR UNLATCHING A PAYLOAD TAKES ABOUT 30 SECONDS.
A CAPTURED PAYLOAD CAN BE LATCHED WHEN THE ABC INDICATORS SHOW GRAY.

MANNED MANEUVERING UNIT:

THE MMU [MANNED MANEUVERING UNIT] IS USED FOR OCCASIONS WHEN OBJECTS
TO BE RETRIEVED ARE OUT OF REACH OF THE NORMAL TETHER AND THE ASTRONAUT
HAS TO LEAVE THE SAFTY OF THE ORBITER TO FLOAT FREE IN SPACE.

FIRST OF ALL,THE ASTRONAUTS MUST DON THEIR SPACE SUITS.THIS LONG AND
LABORIOUS AFFAIR INVOLVES A 3 HOUR PRE-BREATHING PERIOD IN WHICH THE
NITROGEN IN THE ASTONAUTS BLOOD STREAMS IS PURGED BY BREATHING PURE 
OXYGEN FROM THE SPACE SUITS LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

THIS COUNTERACTS THE EFFECTS OF DYSBARISM,OR THE BENDS,WHEN THE ASTRONAUT
GOES INTO THE PRESSURELESS ENVIRONMENT OF SPACE.

ONCE IN THEIR SIUTS,THE ASTRONAUTS GO THROUGH THE AIRLOCK INTO THE 
PAYLOAD BAY,AND ATTACH THEMSELVES TO THE MMU STOWED THERE.IT IS A SORT
OF BACKPACK WITH ARM RESTS,AS SEEN IN ALL THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES.
THE ASTRONAUT LATCHES THE HARD MAIN MENU BACK OF HIS SPACE SUIT TO THE
MMU,DISCONNECTS THE TETHER,UNCLAMPS THE MMU FROM ITS LOCATION ON THE 
BAY WALL,AND THEN PROPELS HIMSELF OUT INTO SPACE BY USING THE HAND 
CONTROLS AT THE END OF EACH ARM REST.THESE CONTROL ANY OR ALL OF THE 
24 THRUSTERS AROUND THE MMU THAT FIRE BURSTS OF NITROGEN IN THE REQUIRED
DIRECTION,GIVING THE ASTRONAUT FULL ROTATIONAL OR TRANSLATIONAL MOVEMENT.

IT IS THEN SIMPLY A QUESTION OF MANEUVERING THE MMU TO THE SATELLITE
OR WHATEVER THAT HAS TO BE RECOVERED,GRABBING HOLD OF IT AND PULLING
IT BACK TO THE CARGO BAY.

IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT OF THE MMUs THRUSTERS FAILING,THE ORBITER CAN 
BE MANEUVERED TO WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE ASTRONAUT,WHO IS THEN
RETIEVED BY USE OF THE RMS ARM.

PAYLOAD DEPLOYMENT:

THE PAYLOAD ASSIST MODULE [PAM],FORMERLY CALLED THE SPINNING SOLID 
UPPER STAGE,IS DESIGNED AS A HIGHER ALTITUDE BOOSTER OF SATELLITES 
DEPLOYED IN NEAR EARTH ORBIT BUT OPERATIONALLY DESIGNED FOR HIGHER
ALTITUDES.

IT IS USED TO BOOST SATELLITES TO A GEOSYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER ORBIT   
[22,300 MILES],OR OTHER HIGHER ENERGY ORBITS AFTER DEPLOYMENT FROM  
THE SHUTTLE.THERE ARE THREE VERSIONS OF THE PAM USED ON THE SHUTTLE:

PAM D  SATELLITES OF UP TO 2,750 lbs

PAM DII 4,150 lbs

PAM A  4,400 lbs

THE PAMs ARE ALSO USED FOR NON-GEOSYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER ORBITS.

THE PAMs DEPLOYABLE STAGE CONSISTS OF A SPIN STABILIZED,SOLID FUELLED
ROCKET MOTOR,A PAYLOAD ATTACH FITTING [PAF] TO MATE WITH THE UNMANNED
SPACECRAFT AND THE NECESSARY TIMING,SEQUENCING,POWER AND CONTROL
ASSEMBLIES.

THE PAM STAGES ARE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE SPIN TABLE AT THE BASE OF THE
MOTOR AND THROUGH RESTRAINTS AT THE PAF.THE FORWARD RESTRAINTS ARE
RETRACTED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT.

PAYLOAD RESCUE:

SEE MISSIONS QUICK REFERENCE.

COMMUNICATIONS:

AUDIO SYSTEM:

THE AUDIO SYSTEM INTERFACES WITH THE CAUTION AND WARNING FOR RECEPTION
OF C/W [TONER] SIGNALS;WITH UHF,S BAND AND KU BAND SYSTEMS FOR TRANSMISSION
AND RECEPTION OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS,BOTH AIR TO AIR AND AIR TO GROUND;AND
WITH THE THREE TACAN SETS FOR RECEIVER SELECTION AND MONITORING.WITH
THESE SYSTEMS THE CREW CAN TALK TO THEMSELVES,TO GROUND CONTROL AND TO
ANYONE ELSE FLOATING AROUND IN SPACE [ SPACE LABS ETC].DURING LAUNCH
AND DESCENT THE CREW COMMUNICATE THROUGH THE HEADSET BUILT IN TO THEIR
HELMETS,WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN PUSH TO TALK BUTTONS,AS DO THE TWO RHCs,
AND FOR THE REST OF THE TIME THROUGH THE SMALLER SNOOPY CAPS WITH THEIR
MICROPHONES AND SWITCHES.

AS YOU WONT BE ABLE TO TALK TO THE SPACE SHUTTLE,VERY FEW OF THE 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN SIMULATED,ALTHOUGH YOU ARE ASKED TO 
GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF DOING VOICE CHECKS SHORTLY BEFORE TAKEOFF,
A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES THE SETTING OF SWITCHES ON PANELS O5 AND O9.

KU BAND ANTENNA:

THE SHUTTLE USES A KU BAND ANTENNA TO COMMUNICATE WITH BOTH THE GROUND
AND WITH PAYLOADS THAT IT IS TRACKING,THE KU ANTENNA IS STOWED IN THE 
PAYLOAD BAY AND DEPLOYED SHORTLY AFTER THE PAYLOAD BAY DOORS ARE OPENED.

CAUTION AND WARNING SYSTEM:

THE CAUTION AND WARNING SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO ALERT THE CREW WHEN
CONDITIONS EXIST THAT EXCEED PREDEFINED OPERATING LIMITS.THE SYSTEM
IS SPLIT INTO THREE CATEGORIES: CLASS 1,EMERGENCY; CLASS 2 CAUTION
AND WARNING; AND CLASS 3,ALERT.

THE EMERGENCY SYSTEM RECOGNIZES FIRE,INDICATED BY A SIREN,OR CABIN
DEPRESSURIZATION,INDICATED BY A KLAXON.THE CAUTION AND WARNING SYSTEM
GENERATES AN ALTERNATING ALARM TONE WHEN AN OUT OF LIMIT CONDITION IS
DETECTED BY DIRECT HARDEWARE OR THE GPCs ON ANY ONE OF 120 DIFFERENT
PARAMETERS.LESS CRITICAL CONDITIONS ARE NOTIFIED BY A STEADY ALERT
TONE.

SMOKE DETECTION AND FIRE SUPPRESSION:

THESE FACILITES ARE TO BE FOUND IN THE CREW CABIN AVIONICS BAYS,CREW
CABIN AND WHEN REVELANT,THE SPACELAB PRESSURIZED MODULE.IONIZATION 
DETECTION SENSE SMOKE UNUSUAL CONCENTRATIONS,TRIGGERING ALARMS AND
RELAYING INFORMATION TO THE CRTs AND TO THE WARNING LIGHTS ON PANEL
L1.

SMOKE ALARMS ARE SEPARATED INTO GROUP A,IN THE LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEM 
BENEATH THE CABIN FLOOR,AND GROUP B,IN THE RIGHT HAND AIR DUCT ON 
THE FLIGHT DECK,AND IN THE AVIONICS BAYS 1,2, AND 3A.

IF THE SYSTEM DETECTS A CONCENTRATION OF 2,200 +/- 200 MICROGRAMS PER
m2,OR AN INCREASE OF 22 Mg/m2 IN 20 SECONDS,THE SMOKE DETECTION A OR
B LIGHT ON THE C/W MASTER ALARM LIGHT,AND SOUNDS THE SIREN IN THE CREW
CABIN.

CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION SYSTEM [CCTV]:

THE ON BOARD CAMERAS ARE USED PRIMARILY FOR VISUAL FEEDBACK TO THE 
CREW OF IN ORBIT OPERATIONS AND FOR THE RECORDING OF THESE OPERATIONS
FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS BY FLIGHT AND GROUND CREWS.

THE CAMERAS,CONTROLLED BY THE ASTRONAUTS AND BY GROUND CONTROL,ARE 
NORMALLY MONOCHROME,BUT HAVE AN OPTIONAL COLOUR CAPABILITY.ON BOARD
MONITORS ARE MONOCHROME ONLY,COLOUR VISUAL IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO GROUND
CONTROL DUE TO HARDWARE RESTRICTIONS.

LOCATIONS:

CAMERAS CAN BE MOUNTED AT A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS WITHIN THE PAYLOAD BAY
INCLUDING TWO ON THE RMS ARM.THEY ARE ALSO USED IN THE MID DECK AND 
FLIGHT DECK.CAMERAS ARE OFTEN MOUNTED ON AN EVA UNIT DEPLOYED FROM THE
PAYLOAD BAY ALLOWING VIEWS OF VIRTUALLY ANY EXTERNAL PART OF THE ORBITER.
ONCE THE DOORS ARE OPEN,IT IS OFTEN FROM THIS UNIT THAT THE VIEWS OF
THE ORBITER OR SATELLITES SET AGAINST THE EARTH ARE SEEN.

MISSION ELAPSED TIME:

THE MISSION ELAPSED TIME [MET] IS SHOWN ON PANELS O3 AND A4.GMT CAN BE
SHOWN INSTEAD USING THE MISSION TIMER SWITCH ON PANEL A4.

THE EVENT TIMER IS SHOWN ON PANEL F7 WITH CONTROL SWITCHES ON PANEL C2.
THE AFT EVENT TIMER IS SHOWN ON PANEL A4 WITH CONTROL SWITCHES ON PANEL
A6.

FOOD:

EVEN ASTRONAUTS HAVE TO EAT.THE FACILITIES FOR STORAGE,PREPARATION AND
CONSUMPTION OF THE THREE DAILY MEALS ARE LOCATED ON THE MIDDECK OF THE
ORBITER.GONE ARE THE DAYS OF SPACE RATIONS,WHEN EACH MEAL CONSISTED 
OF A REHYDRATED POWER THAT WAS ALMOST BUT NOT QUITE UNLIKE FOOD.TODAY
SHUTTLE CREWS HAVE A CHOICE OF FRESH AND PRESERVED FOODS THAT ARE AS 
CLOSE TO THE REAL THING AS YOU CAN SAFELY GET 200 MILES UP.NO LONGER
DO THE PILOTS HAVE TO SMUGGLE THEIR OWN FOOD ON BOARD,AS JOHN YOUNG
DID ON HIS SPACE FLIGHT IN 1965.HE OFFERED HIS COMMANDER A CORN BEEF
SANDWICH.

MEDICINE:

THE SHUTTLE IS VERY WELL EQUIPPED IN THIS DEPARTMENT,CARRYING EVERYTHING
FROM CODEINE TO CRICOTHYROTOMY SETS.THEY MUST BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH EVERY
EMERGENCY FROM A NOSE BLEED TO A HEART ATTACK.ITS A LONG WAY TO THE 
NEAREST HOSPITAL.

BOTH SHUTTLE ORBITER MEDICAL SYSTEMS [SOMS] AND THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL
KIT [EMK] ARE LOCATED IN A MIDDECK FORWARD LOCKER,AND CONSIST OF PALLETS
CONTAINING VARIOUS MEDICAL SUPPLIES,IE. ONE HAS PILLS,ANOTHER BANDAGES
ETC.

ELECTRICAL POWER DISTRIBUTION:

THE SHUTTLE IS SUPPLIED WITH POWER FROM THE GROUND UNTIL T-3 MINUTES
30 SECONDS.THEREAFTER,THE ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM [EPS] SUPPLIES THE
SHUTTLE SYSTEMS WITH ELECTRICAL POWER [28 VOLTS DC].THE POWER IS 
PRODUCED BY REACTING HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY.AS A
BY-PRODUCT,WATER AND HEAT FOR LIFE SUPPORT IS PRODUCED.THE MAIN CONTROLS
ARE ON PANEL R1,AND WHILE THIS PANEL IS INCLUDED IN SPACE SHUTTLE THE 
SIMULATOR,THE ELECTRICAL POWER DISTRIBUTION SWITCHES WONT BE ACTIVE.

2 LANDING:

THE PROCEDURES FOR LANDING THE SHUTTLE ARE LAID OUT IN SECTION 4 MISSION
PROCEDURES,BUT THE MAIN COMPONANTS,[SSMEs,TACAN,GNC,ETC] ARE ALSO DETAILED
EARLIER IN THE LAUNCH SECTION.

LANDING GEAR:

THE LANDING GEAR CONSISTS OF STEERABLE NOSE GEAR AND LEFT AND RIGHT 
MAIN GEAR LOCATE UNDER THE WINGS ADJACENT TO THE MAIN FUSELAGE.THE
MAIN GEAR HAS BRAKE ASSEMBLIES WITH ANTI SKID PROTECTION.THE LANDING
GEAR IS NORMALLY DEPLOYED AT ABOUT 250 FEET,AROUND 15 SECONDS BEFORE
TOUCHDOWN AT NA AIRSPEED OF LESS THAN 300 KNOTS.

4 MISSION PROCEDURES:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  SHUTTLE MISSION GUIDE


GENERAL PROCEDURES

ROLLOUT (KENNEDY ONLY)


The rollout procedure is done automatically as soon as the simulation is started. By going to an external view, you will see the shuttle riding on the crawler moving toward the launch pad at Kennedy. This is a very long process and will take some tim
 to view as the crawler travels very slowly. Once the shuttle has been deposited at the launch pad, the crawler will simply start traveling back toward its parked position next to the hanger at Kennedy Space Centre. If you would rather just jump dire
tly into the game,return to the main menu and select a starting position farther into the mission than rollout, However,if you are a "die hard" simulator fanatic, you are just going to have to wait 7 hours for the crawler to reach the launch pad (and
no time skipping!)


LAUNCHING

Launching Simulation Procedures Start at T- 5 hours.

The external tank will begin automatically filling with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen at T- 000:04:30:00.00 and T- 000:02:50:00.00 respectively. These two components will provide the fuel for the three primary shuttle engines. It is not necessary
to issue any commands during these procedures.

A T-000:01:50:00.00, The shuttle astronauts actually enter the space shuttle through a side hatch and climb into their respective seats, Then at T-1:35 the shuttle crew will un-stow the check list, or cue cards and begin manually preparing the shuttl
 for the launching procedure. Again this process requires no commands from you.

At T-000:01:30:00.00, you are instructed to begin communication checks. You will test all channels including air to ground,intercom,and air to air communication devices. You will have to set each of the five switches for the right audio from the off 
osition to the T/R or transmit and receive position.

At T-000:01:00:00.00, you are instructed to power up the three front CRT screens. To do this, simply place each power switch to the uppermost or on position. NOTE: each of these sreens will require 45 seconds to power up and you will be notified when
each screen is ready for use.

At T-000:00:50:00.00, you should begin pre-activating the water boiler. To do this, you must turn on the three boiler power switches and turn on the three N2 supply switches.

At T-000:00:30:00.00, the ground crew will fall back away from the Shuttle and secure the white room.

At T-000:00:26:00.00, you are instructed to open the cabin vents. It is mentioned in the ground communications that a klaxon alarm will sound; however, there is no representation of this in the simulator.
To open the cabin vents, place both vent isolation and vent position switches in the open position. You will be closing these vents prior to lift off




At T-000:00:24:00.00, the commander does communication voice checks with ground control. To do this, set the xmit/icom mode knob to vox/vox, then turn on communication (air to air,air to ground and intercom) system switches on the left audio panel.

At T-000:00:21:00.00, you are requested to close both cabin vent switches, Just place both cabin vent control switches in the closed position.

At T-000:00:20:00.00, you will begin a planned ten minute hold. This is the first of such holds that will allow you to make up time if you are falling behind a bit in the opeerations.

Immediately after the ten minute hold at T-000:00:19:59.00, you will load the flight plan into the computer. Enter SPEC 99 PRO on the left keypad. This will now display the current flight trajectory on CRT#2.

At T-000:00:19:00.00, you will enter the following codes on the left keypad, OPS 101 PRO and then SPEC 104 PRO. Doing this will load the circularize orbit code and display this on CRT#1.

At T-000:00:16:00.00,, Ground control will inform you to pressurise the main propulsion system with helium. To accomplish this you must switch open the six MPS Helium ISOL valves and place the Pneumatic Helium Isolation Valve to open.

At T-000:00:09:00.00, you will begin the second of the two ten minute holds. If you are still on track with the instructions from ground control, you will be soon burning your way into space.

At T-000:00:08:59.00, if all systems are still go, you will resume the countdown and go for the launch. At this time, check to see that the event timer is set to 0900 and place the event timer switch to the start position.

At T-000:00:07:00.00, the crew access arm retracts from the launching tower. This is an automatic sequence and will require no commands from you;however, you have reached the point where you are dedicated to launch the shuttle as your only exit is by
emergency procedures.

At T-000:00:06:00.00, ground control will give the command to pre-start the Auxiliary Power Units. The boilers should already have the N2 supply on so set the Boiler Control switches to position A. Next, set the APU Fuel Tank Valves to closed. Now pr
ceed to set the APU Fuel Pump Valve to off and the APU Auto Shut Down switches to enable, and finally set the APU Speed Selection switches to Normal.

At T-000:00:05:00.00, the APU,s should be pre-started and it is now time to fully start the APU,s. To do this, turn the APU Control switches to off. Place the three Hyraulic Main Pump Pressure to low, open the APU Fuel Tank Valves and set the APU Ope
ate switch to start/run. Next set the Main Pump Pressure to low, and set the three Hydraulic Circulating Pumps to off.

At T-000:00:04:30.00, all external power is shutdown and the shuttle will change over to complete internal power. ground Control will inform you when all external power links have been shutdown. All internal systems are now handled by the General Pur
ose Computers.

At T-000:00:03:45.00, all aero surfaces are placed in the take off positions and a hydraulic system check is run. This all happens automatically and you will be informed by Ground Control when these actions are compleated.



At T-000:00:03:00.00, the three main SSME,s hydraulically gimbal to the launch position.

At T-000:00:02:55.00, the External Tank oxygen vents automatically close. This begins the liquid oxygen tank pressurisation.

At T-000:00:02:00.00, Ground Control instructs you to set all three APU,s auto shutdown abilities to Inhibit. This will not allow any of the main APU,s to shut down during the actual launch.

A T-000:00:01:57.00, the External Tank hydrogen vents automatically close. This begins the pressurisation of the liquid hydrogen tank. This is the last command you will give the Shuttle before the actual take off. There are a number of actions that w
ll still need to be performed, but these will all happen automatically and you will not need to perform any vital commands util you are well into the liftoff stage.

At T-000:00:00:03.00, the general purpose computers command the three main engins to start.

At T-000:00:00:00.00, if the main engine pressure reads higher than 90% the Solid Rocket Boosters are ignited.

At T+000:00:00:03.00, the Solid Rocket Boosters ignite and you should read liftoff.

At T+000:00:00:06.00, you should clear the launch tower and Ground Control will inform you if all engines appear to be working properly.

At T+000:00:00:11.00, after clearing the tower, you will notice the Shuttle begining to roll into the heads down position that is common in all launch procedures. Basically, the Shuttle will roll over with the External Tank above the Shuttle during t
e ascent. This procedure is completely controlled by the on-board computers.

At T+000:00:00:30.00, the heads down roll should have completed and Ground Control will check again to make sure everything is looking good.

At T+000:00:02:00.00, Ground Control will instruct you to set the Attitude Direction Indication to give information relative to local vertical and local horizontal positions. To do this, set the ADI ATT switches on both the commander and pilots panel
 to LVLH. at the same time as this happens, the Solid Rocket Boosters will empty and be separated from the External Tank. The Shuttle will continue on with the primary thrust coming from the main engines.

At T+000:00:04:20.00, you reach the point where you can no longer safely return to the landing site if an emergency occurs. If something were to go wrong now, you would either have to eject from the Shuttle or return to an emergency landing site.

At T+000:00:06:30.00, the Shuttle will automatically begin a shallow dive to prepare for the seperation of the External Tank.

At T+000:00:08:30.00, at this time the main engine will shut down and the External Tank will separate from the Shuttle and fall back towards earth, burning up in the atmosphere.

This completes the actual launching procedures, from this point onwards you will be preparing the Shuttle for its actual mission and doing orbital insertion maneuvers.



INITIAL ORBIT MANEUVERS

During the Orbital Insertion Maneuvers you will basically circularise your low orbit, and then set up the Shuttle Orbiter for the mission you will be performing. There are a number of miscellaneous procedures that must be carried out each time the Sh
ttle first enters orbit. Once the Shuttle is in orbit, you are ready to begin mission communications.

Provided below are generic mission procedures which can be utilised for each mission.

At T+000:00:09:00.00, the orbit insertion burn will prepare and occur. This takes a bit of time and is mostly handled by the on-board computers.

At T+000:00:10:30.00, you will be required to set both ADIs to the INTRL setting. Similar to the launching procedure, simply place the ADI switch to the INTRL setting.

At T+000:00:11:00.00, you are instructed to circulrise your orbit.On the left keypad enter SPEC 104 PRO, and then enter ITEM 27 EXEC. This will adjust the OMS burn to a circularised orbit.

At T+000:00:12:24.00, the OMS-1 Burn will be completed. Ground Control will inform you of this action.

At T+000:00:14:30.00, you will begin post OMS burn APU shutdown. You are instructed to turn to enable the three APU auto shut down switches. Next turn the three Boiler Controlers to the off position and finally, set the APU controls to the off positi
n.

At T+000:00:15:40.00, Ground Control will now request that you change the program on the third CRT. You are requested to enter the following command OPS 105 PRO.

At T+000:00:16:50.00, Ground Control will now request that you close the external tank umbilical doors in preparation of opening the payload bay doors.

At T+000:00:19:00.00, after the ubilical doors have been closed you must latch them shut. On the same panel as the door close switches,select to latch both doors.

At T+000:0046:34.00, you must do another small CRT program change. Enter the following command OPS 106 PRO on the keypad.

A T+000:0047:00.00, Ground Control will request that you open the payload bay doors. To do this, enable both system 1 and system 2 power systems and click on the open switch to start the opening sequence. Once the doors are fully opened, Ground Contr
l will inform you that the doors show fully open.

At T+000:00:48:50.00, because of the large amount of heat that was built up during the launch procedure, you will now begin preparing to open the bay radiators. Start by releasing the radiator latches, found on the same panel as the payload door cont
ols. Now turn on both left and right System Mechanical Power switches, then select deploy for both starboard and port latches.

At T+000:00:52:00.00, the latches should now be opened you may deploy both of the cooling radiators. Make sure that both system power switches are on and then select deploy for both starboard and port radiators. Once both radiators are open, Ground C
ntrol will confirm their position.

At T+000:00:53:30.00, to finalise the orbital procedure, you must now deploy the KU Band Antenna. On the same panel, position the KU Antenna switch to the deploy position. Once the Antenna has been fully deployed, Ground Control will also confirm its
position.

At T+000:00:55:00.00, with all of the orbital preparations complete, Ground Control will now inform you to start the Mission Comms when you are ready. To do this, use the menu system to pull down the request mission comms under the actions title. Whe
 Ground Control has confirmed that orbital preparations are complete, they will inform you to get the job done.

LANDING

The landing phase is rarly exactly the same each time. Omce you have requested "Landing Comms", you will go through the same procedures you went through when preparing the Shuttle for mission comms, but in reverse. The process of stowing the KU band 
ntenna, closing and latching the radiators, stowing the RMS arm ( if used ), and closing and latching the payload doors, occurs in almost exactly the reverse order.

After the Orbiter is prepared for the orbital re-entry, you will just float around the earth until you reach the de-orbit oms burn. When this happens, the Shuttle will automatically turn and face heads down toward the earth and the opposite direction
it is travelling and perform the "slow down" burn. After the burn is complete, the orbiter will again, in automatic, turn around facing the direction it is travelling in a slightly nose up attitude for the re-entry. You may want to gently adjust the 
itch and roll so that it is perfectly centered on the earth.

Soon you will notice an orange glow appearing on the bottom of the Shuttle and the dark black of space beginning to transform into the familiar blue sky again. At this time, the accelerated speed is generating immense heat in the Shuttle. it is vital
that you maintain the slightly nose up attitude through this stage, or you will burn up during re-entry.

When you finally completely re-enter the atmosphere, you will notice that your controls have switched from the Reaction Control Jets to standard aerodynamic controls. Now, locate the landing area with the aids of the HSL, the HUD, and the SPEC 50 cir
le down screen found on CRT#3. If the Horizontal Situation Screen is not loaded on CRT#3, hold down the ALT key and the keyboard should appear over the screen. Now click on clear and then on SPEC 50 PRO. This will show the flight track you want to fo
low down until you are at a safe distance to start your final approach.

Around the 20,000 foot mark, start your final approach. Use the F2 HUD screen to follow in on final approach. If you,re a bit high, use the air brake to slow you down while you descend. As you approach the runway, make sure you arm your landing gear 
nd keep your speed up over 300 knots. Now at about 1000 feet, start your pre-flare maneuver to slow the Shuttles speed down. Shortly after, deploy your landing gear and then at about 100-200 feet, perform the final flare maneuver. You should touch do
n on the rear wheels first and then let the nose gently come down to touch the ground as well.

If you need to straighten out the Shuttle as you coast down the runway, use the "," and "." keys for seering control. Now to slow down, press the W key for the wheel brakes and use the "=" key to apply full air brakes.



Once you have stopped, the game will pause for a moment allowing you to view your recent sucess, and then bring you to the mission debriefing/evaluation screen. Cross your fingers and hope that you,ve done well.

TEST FLIGHTS

Since you are only out in space to test the Space Shuttle, you will not receive any mission commands during either test flight from Ground Control. Thus, by requesting mission comms, you will only start the landing procedures.

MISSION PROCEDURES

ALT 747

This is a simple unpowered test landing for the new Shuttle Commander. The mission will start with the Shuttle piggy-backed on the 747 at 000:00:00:45.00 to 747 seperation. Approximately ten seconds later, you will be notified to turn on the HUD disp
ays. Once this is complete, you are on your own. You must manually guide the Shuttle down to a safe landing. Caution: a stall at this low height would almost certainly spell disaster so keep your speed up! Also be sure to arm and deploy your landing 
ear with the ALT-G commands as Ground Control will not inform you of this action.

MMU TEST FLIGHT

When the Orbiter is prepared for this mission, all you have to do is release the MMU, move it a short distance away from the Shuttle and then return it to the Shuttle and finally re-attach the MMU. This all sounds rather simple. However, space is a v
ry big place and maneuvering in 3 dimensions is something humans do not often do. Like the Shuttle, the MMU can both rotate and translate on three separate axis. If you manage to get the MMU moving and rotating on more than one axis, you will soon un
erstand just how difficult it can be to move about in space. It is strongly recommended that you spend some time getting used to moving around in space before continuing onto more advanced missions. it is also advised that you make all of your adjust
ents precise, and on a single axis only.

SATELLITE LAUNCH

This is the first mission in which the Shutle crew will perform a function that is a non test based maneuver. After the Shuttle is prepared for the mission, request "Mission Comms" to start the countdown to the satellite launch.

At 000:00:24:00.00, you are instructed to activate the PAM power system and check the system status. Simply place the PAM system 2 power switch into the norm position and wait for the system to power up and for the system status check to run.

At 000:00:20:00.00, the system will have completed the status check.

At 000:00:17:30.00, you are instructed to take manual control of the Orbiter. To do this, go to the DAP panel and click on the manual button.

At 000:00:15:00.00, you are instructed to maneuver the Shuttle into the correct position for the satellite deployment. This operation is a bit tricky. you will need to set the ADI instrument to the REF position and align the three error needles on th
 nearby ADI instrument. Although accuracy here is important, Ground Control does have the ability to maneuver the satellite after deployment if the Shuttle is not in the optimum position.

At 000:00:14:00.00, the spin table is automatically unlocked and the satellite lifts into the deployment position where it will begin to spin up to the correct deployment speed.

At 000:00:06:50.00, the spin table and satellite will have achieved the correct rotational speed.

At 000:00:00:00.00, Ground Control will instruct you to select and deploy the satellite. This operation consists of placing the Payload Select switch to position 2, and then switching the payload latches switch to the release position. As soon as tha
 is done, the satellite will begin to move away from the Shuttle and provide you with a very nice external view of the operation,s completion. After approximately a minute, the satellite will have achieved a safe distance from the Shuttle and you may
begin the landing procedure.

LAUNCH HUBBLE TELESCOPE

This is the first mission in which you will use the RMS, or robot arm. The overall procedure is to place the Shuttle into orbit. First, lift the telescope out of the payload bay with the RMS. Next, move the telescope away from the Shuttle, release th
 telescope and then move the Shuttle away from the deployed telescope.

Hubble Release starts at 000:00:25:00.00.

At 000:00:24:55.00, you are requested to select the port rms and turn on the power. After this has been done, release the RMS from its stowed position. It will take approximately 8 seconds for the RMS to be released and then approximately 30 seconds 
or the RMS to be deployed into the ready state.

At 000:00:21:00.00, now that the RMS is ready to perform either automatic or manual operations, it is time to grab the Hubble Telescope. Ground Control will instruct you to move the RMS into the GRAB position and start the auto grab sequence. This is
accomplished by placing the RMS MODE knob to auto selection number 3, and then placing the Auto Sequence switch to proceed.

The onboard computers will automatically move the RMS to a position exactly over the grapple point of the Hubble Telescope.

At 000:00:17:00.00, the auto sequence will have completed and you will be instructed to grab the Hubble with the RMS,s standard end effector. To do this, simply press the ENTER key on the keyboard.

At 000:00:14:00.00, Ground Control will instruct you to move the Hubble out of the main payload bay and into a safe position. This automatic sequence is initiated by setting the RMS MODE knob to auto selection number 2 and placing the auto sequence s
itch to proceed.

This sequence will lift the Hubble up and out of the Shuttle bay and leave it resting parallel with the Shuttle bay, a few feet outside the bay itself.

At 000:00:10:00.00, the third and final sequence will be requested from Ground Control. In this sequence, you will maneuver the Hubble Telescope to its release position, initiated by placing the RMS MODE knob to auto selection number 4 and again plac
ng the auto sequence switch to proceed. This is a sequence that provides a nice view of the Hubble Telescope solar panels being deployed as the telescope nears its release point.



At 000:00:07:00.00, the telescope will have completed its movement to the release position and you simply have to give the Remote Manipulation System - Standard End Effector the command to release the grapple point by pressing BACKSPACE.

At 000:00:04:00.00, Ground Control will give instructions to place the Orbiter in manual control and move a safe distance away from the Hubble Telescope. To do this, go to the Orbital DAP panel and highlight the manual control selection. Take an exte
nal view and very carefully move the Shuttle away from the telescope using the translation key commands. If you collide with the telescope you run a chance of tearing off the RMS completely so caution here is vital.

After Ground Control has informed you that you have reached a safe distance from the telescope, you may request "Landing Comms".

SPACE STATION SOLAR PANEL

This mission is very similar to the one described on the previous page. You will be deploying a large solar panel that will in future missions supply power to a space station. The same procedures will be followed as in the Hubble Telescope mission wi
h few variances. it is suggested that you follow the commands from the previous mission to become more familiar with Shuttle operations as the next two missions will become exceptionally more difficult.

SPACE STATION CREW MODULE

In this mission, you will be performing another series of actions to further the space station program. Using the RMS, you will be required to attach a crew module to the solar panel that was deployed in the previous mission.

At 000:00:01:00.00, you are instructed to select the port RMS, supply power to the RMS, release the RMS latches and deploy the RMS. This operation is the same as in the two previous missions.

At 000:00:08:00.00, the Auto Grab sequence should be initiated. Similar to the previous mission, you will select RMS auto mode 3 and PROCEED with the sequence. Finally, you will grab the module when the sequence has completed.

At 000:00:14:00.00, begin the Auto Safe Position sequence. Select RMS AUTO MODE 2 and PROCEED with the sequence.

At 000:00:18:00.00, you are informed that you will be rendezvousing wiht the solar panel and that you can find the IMU TRACKING data on CRT #2: If that data is not on screen, use the following command to bring that CRT onscreen: while holding the ALT
key click on OPS 104, then on EXEC.

At 000:00:19:00.00, you will place the DAP in manual moded. This will allow you to manually track and translate the Shuttle to the orbiting Solar Panel. This operation is very difficult. The following is the quickest way to locate and translate to an
already orbiting satellite.

First off, you have to find that floating metal monster. When you take over manual control, you are at such a great distance from the Solar Panel that you will not be able to discern the difference between a star and the panel itself. The best way to
locate the satellite is to go to an external view and zoom away from the Space Shuttle. While you are zooming, you will notice one of the simulated stars is not moving as much as all of the others. That odd-looking star happens to be the Solar Panel.
Now, align the external view so that the Solar Panel is in a direct line between you and the Shuttle. Next zoom back in toward the Shuttle, making sure you pass by the Solar Panel during this zoom. If you do not pass by the Solar Panel, you have plac
d the Shuttle in between the external view and the Solar Panel rather than placing the Solar Panel between the external view and the Shuttle. Simple isnt it?

Now that you have these all lined up in a straight line, continue to zoom right up next to the Space Shuttle, which will be facing in some random direction. Rotate the Shuttle so that the front windows are facing directly in the zoom view. You should
now be facing directly towards the orbiting Space Station Solar Panel. Now is a exceptionally good time to save a log file.

To begin translating toward the Solar Panel, make sure that you are operating the Forward Rotational Hand Controller by pressing F on the keyboard. Now, set up the time advance window to advance in ten second intervals, displaying every ten seconds. 
egin the translation by pressing ALT and = a number of times. Now, you are moving toward the satellite. Time advance a minute and go back to your external view, which should still be facing straight into the nose of the Shuttle, and zoom back out to 
he Solar Panel. Watch the Solar Panel for a few seconds to be sure that it is definately moving toward the Shuttle. You may need to re-adjust the view slightly. Zoom back into the Shuttle and adjust it also if you have adjusted the external view. Now
go to the HUD display and you should see the Solar Panel somewhere in  that display. Time advance a few more times and, if neccessary increase your translation speed a few more times. In a short amount of time, you will begin to notice that the Panel
is getting bigger in the HUD view. You will have to make a few minor up,down,left and right adjustments to keep on the correct track towards the Solar Panel. Continue doing this until you begin to get close to the Solar Panel. Remember, space is a ve
y big place.

When you have decided that you are getting close to the Solar Panel, you should start slowing down. Begin to fire the translational jets in the opposite direction ALT and -. When you are slowly moving toward the panel, go to the orbital DAP and selec
 VERN. This will give you finer control of the Shuttles movements now that you are close to the Solar Panel.

By examining the Crew Module head closely you will find that one of the circles has a darker ring around it. This is the connection joint. If you also examine the Solar Panel, you will find a very similar joint on one end of the Panel.

At this point, you are completely free to move the RMS by manual contol using the keys [ and ]. This will move or rotate whichever joint has been selected. If you need to select a different joint on the RMS, use the CNTL J command to view and select 
rom the list of avaible joints ( Shoulder, Wrist, Elbow). When finer movements are required while using the RMS, hold down the ALT key while pressing the [ ] keys for slow, very fine movements.

Using the manual mode of the RMS, position that dark circle so it can be easily attached to the Solar Panel without allowing the Solar PAnel to get close to the Shuttle. Now using your Vernia jets, translate slowing around until you can line up the t
o joints at which time they will automatically attach themselves together. Once the two pieces are attached, release the Crew Module and move the Shuttle a safe distance away from the nearly finished space station. Once the Shuttle is at a safe dista
ce you have completed the mission. A job well done. Request Landing Comms and all that is left to do now is land again.


REPAIR HUBBLE TELESCOPE

Soon after the Hubble Telescope was placed in orbit, it was learned that there was a few technical problems with its ability to focus. it was a priority to find a solution to this problem or the company that developed it would suffer extreme embarras
ment. A plan was created in which a space walking astronaut would be sent out to the Hubble Telescope to place a small upgraded electronics box on the rear section of the telescope. With this piece attached, the Hubble, although still not fully meeti
g its design spec, would be able to give the scientific community an imprved view of the universe. You will now be faced with the challenge of placing this box on the back of the Hubble. good luck!

After the Shuttle has gone through the orbital insertion mameuvers and has readied its system for the mission, the MET will start counting up to T+ Hubble Repair. As in the previous mission you will be required to locate an orbiting satellite and the
 manually maneuver the Shuttle close to it. Once you are close again, switch to the Vernia jets and maneuver the Shuttle right up next to the Hubble. Now be very careful that the Shuttle is moving as close as possible to the Telescopes speed as you d
 not want the two to collide or move away from each other when you are using the MMU.

When you are satisfied with the positioning of the Shuttle, release the MMu. You will notice that the MMU has a small triangular electronics box on the front of it. You must place this box on the back (large end) of the Hubble Telescope. Patience is 
equired here, so take your time moving in toward the Hubble. Use gentle movements as the MMU can react rather abruptly to rapid input and you can easily overshoot the position you want to be in. The electronics box the MMU is carrying will automatica
ly attach when you have the MMU close enough and at the correct angle relative to the Telescope.

Once you have placed the box on the back of the Telescope, return the MMU to the Shuttle and re-attach it to its mouting area in the Shuttles payloaad bay. With that finished, request Landing Comms and have a safe return flight.

SATELLITE RECOVERY

In this mission, you will be recovering a satellite by using the RMS robot arm rather than using the MMU. When the mission starts, you should quickly locate the orbiting satellite on an external view. Now, be prepared to begin the rotational and tran
lational movements toward the satellite.

At 000:00:00:05.00, Ground Control will tell you to locate the satellite and then operate the RMS to recover it. However, you will need to deploy the RMS first.

At 000:00:02:00.00, select the PORT RMS, and the power ON

At 000:00:04:00.00, release the port RMS latches.

At 000:00:08:00.00, Deploy the RMS.

At 000:00:10:00.00, place the DAP in MANUAL and begin the translation to the satellite.

Once you are close enough to the satellite, place the DAP in Vernia jet mode and maneuver the Shuttle directly below the satellite. Place the satellite right above the open bay doors and use the RMS controls to grapple the satellite. If after hours o
 trying this you cannot grapple the satellite, maneuver the Shuttle so that the satellite is actually in  the payload bay and then close the Orbiter doors. Be sure that the RMS is not in the way of the doors or they ill get stuck.

With that quick solution to this mission, request Landing Comms and return home.

SECRET MILITARY MISSION

This mission details the operation necessary for deploying a Military Spy Satellite. Once the Shuttle is prepared for this mission, you will need to manually grab and deploy the satellite with the RMS arm.

Releasing Simulation Procedures start at 000:00:25:00.00.

At 000:00:24:55:00.00, you are again requested to select the port RMS, activate the power system, release the RMS latches and deploy the satellite. This process takes a total of approximately 36 seconds to complete.

Now you may manually move the RMS to the satellites grapple point and grab it with the SEE. It is a bit tricky to move the RMS to the exact location relying on external views only so use the cameras in the Shuttle bay to gain a more accurate view of 
he positions of the RMS arm. Once you have positioned the Standard End Effector at the satellites grapple point, press the ENTER key to actually grapple it. Be patient as it may take a number of tries before you can do this with ease.

With the satellite in hand, move up and away from the Shuttle and press the BACKSPACE key to release the satellite. Now, be sure the SHuttle is in manual DAP operation and translate the Shuttle a safe distance away from the satellite. During this pro
ess you may want to move the RMS arm back down inside the Shuttles main cargo bay. Once you are done with this, request Landing Comms and continue through the normal landing sequence.

INSTRUMENT LANDING

Very briefly, you will be attempting a simulated landing in heavy cloud cover. All external views will be black until you are 35 feet above the ground. Use the HSI to find the runway. Follow the glide down circle around once, enter final approach and
finally, use the HUD to view the highlighted runway. Easy.
