ATTRIBUTES:
A PLAYERS ATTRIBUTES DETERMINE HIS/HER INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS DURING A MATCH.
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU MIGHT THINK SPEED IS ESSENTIAL TO ATTACKERS AND ATTACK
CAPABILITIES VITAL TO DEFENDERS. THE ATTRIBUTE BUTTONS ALLOW YOU TO CUSTOMISE
YOUR TEAM ACCORDING TO YOUR NEEDS.

AGR-AGGRESSION......DEFINES WETHER PLAYER WILL ATTACK OPPONENT IN HIS
                    AREA.AGGRESSIVE PLAYERS GO OFF AND FIGHT THEIR OPPONENTS
                    RATHER THAN ACTUALLY PLAYING THE GAME.

ATT-ATTACK..........THIS DETERMINES HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE WHEN TRYING TO TAKE
                    THE BALL FROM AN OPPONENT.

DEF-DEFENSE.........THE STRONGER THIS IS,THE HARDER IT IS FOR ANYONE TO TAKE
                    THE BALL FROM YOU.

SPD-SPEED...........DETERMINES YOUR SPEED,SLIDE AND JUMPING DISTANCE.

THR-THROWING........PLAYERS WHO CAN THROW FURTHER ARE A GREAT ASSET.

POW-POWER...........A PLAYER WITH MORE POWER TACKLES HARDER AND INJURES HIS
                    OPPONENT SEVERELY.

STA-STAMINA.........THIS IS DEFENCE AGAINST `POWER`. A PLAYER WITH A HIGH
                    STAMINA WILL BE INJURED LESS SEVERELY WHEN TACKLED.

INT-INTELLIGENCE....CONTROLS PREDICTION OF PLAYER POSITION OR BALL,REACTION
                    TIME,AND HOW FAR THE PLAYER CAN LOOK AROUND HIM,A SMART
                    SQUAD HAS QUICKER REACTIONS AND MOVES INTO INTELLIGENT
                    ATTACKING POSITIONS MORE FREQUENTLY.

SPEEDBALL 2 IS PLAYED OVER 2 HALF`S LASTING 90 SECONDS EACH. TEAMS SWAP ENDS
AT HALF TIME. THE ACTION STARTS WHEN THE BALL IS LAUNCHED INTO PLAY IN THE
CENTRE OF THE PITCH. THIS HAPPENS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PERIOD, OR AFTER
A GOAL, OR AFTER A GOAL HAS BEEN SCORED. OR A PLAYER SUBSTITUTED. THE OBJECT
OF THE GAME IS TO SCORE MORE POINTS THAN YOUR OPPONENT-BUT HOW YOU DO IS UP
TO YOU (SEE SCORING POINTS)

CONTROLLING YOUR TEAM:
YOU CONTROL THE PLAYER ON YOUR TEAM WHO IS NEAREST THE BALL,THIS IS YOUR
CONTROL PLAYER(CP). HE/SHE WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED WITH AN ARC IN YOUR TEAMS
COLOUR ABOVE HIS/HER HEAD. WHEN THE PLAYER HAS THE BALL HE WILL HAVE A
LETTER ABOVE HIS HEAD DENOTING HIS GROUPS POSITION.

A.....CENTRE FORWARD
M.....MIDFIELD
D.....DEFENCE
W.....WINGER
G.....GOALKEEPER

EACH MEMBER OF THE TEAM CAN MOVE AND THROW THE BALL IN 8 DIRECTIONS.TO THROW
THE BALL,PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON. A SHORT PRESS RELEASES IT AT WAIST HEIGHT, A
LONGER PRESS MEANS THE BALL IS THROWN UP HIGH IN THE AIR.
IN ADDITION,A SUBTLE AMOUNT OF `AFTER-TOUCH` CAN BE APPLIED TO THE BALL AFTER
IT HAS BEEN THROWN BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK UP OR DOWN,LEFT OR RIGHT,THIS MEANS
THAT YOU CAN DIRECT THE BALL ANYWHERE YOU WANT TO.
IF YOUR TEAM IS NOT IN POSSESSION,PRESSING THE FIRE BUTTON CAN HAVE ONE OF
THREE EFFECTS. IF THE BALL IS IN THE AIR NEAR YOUR (CP),HE/SHE WILL JUMP TO
CATCH IT. IF THE BALL IS ON THE GROUND OR AT WAIST HEIGHT,YOUR PLAYER WILL
SLIDE TO INTERCEPT IT. IF A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSING TEAM HAS THE BALL, PRESSING
FIRE WILL ATTEMPT A TACKLE.

THE GOALKEEPER:
THE GOALKEEPER IS CONTROLLED WHEN HE IS THE (CP) WHEN ROVING AWAY FROM THE GOAL
HE CAN JUMPO UP AND CATCH THE BALL,THROW IT AND TACKLE AS
NORMAL,ADDITIONALLY,WHEN THE BALL IS MOVING,PRESSING FIRE WITH THE JOYSTICK
LEFT OR RIGHT CAUSES HIM TO DIVE FOR THE BALL.HOWEVER,HE CAN`T TRAVEL OUTSIDE
HIS OWN GOAL AREA-ABOUT A SCREENS DISTANCE FROM GOAL.

TACKLING:
SUCCESSFUL TACKLES DEPEND ON THE RELATIVE ATTACK/DEFENSE ATTRIBUTES OF THE TWO
PLAYERS INVOLVED,IF YOU WIN THE TACKLE,YOUR OOPONENT LOSES ENERGY,AND VICE
VERSA.
TACKLING A PLAYER ALSO REDUCES HIS/HER ATTRIBUTES,YOU CAN TACKLE ANY PLAYER AT
ANY TIME-EVEN OFF THE BALL.PLAYERS ARE MOST VULNERABLE WHEN JUMPING AND FACING
AWAY FROM YOU.

INJURIES/SUBSTITUTIONS:
WHEN THEIR ENERGY LEVEL IS REDUCED TO ZERO,PLAYERS ARE UNABLE TO MOVE AND HAVE
TO BE STRETCHERED OFF BY THE ROBODOC`S,A SUBSTITUTE IS BROUGHT ON AS A
REPLACEMENT.FOR EVERY PLAYER YOU INJURE-YOU SCORE 10 POINTS,SUNSTITUTED
PLAYERS ATTRIBUTES DO NOT RESET TO THEIR STARTING LEVELS AFTER A MATCH.

SCORE MULTI-PLIERS:
THIS IS A SIMPLE WAY TO INCREASE EVERY SCORE YOU MAKE BY 100%.TO ACTIVATE THE
SCORE MULTI-PLIER,THROW THE BALL UP THE RAMP.YOUR OPPONENTS CAN GAIN CONTROL
