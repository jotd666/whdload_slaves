  On the early levels, try jumping underneath toadstools and clouds to
  find lots of hidden coins.


Well after a long delay, this patch is finished!  I personally think this
is the best platform game ever made, certainly better than Zool and Sonic
the Hedgehog!  Everything about the game oozes class and I have tried to
make this patch perfect!

Please note that pressing Escape during the game has been modified to
return you to the title screen rather than quitting the CD32 version.
Press the fire button or the quit key to quit the intro sequence.

I coded the trainer as the final space level is *very* difficult!

If you use any cheat your high scores will not be saved!

Be aware if you are installing the disk version, the Story disk is disk 3!

Greetings to Jean-Francois Fabre (JOTD) for the original JST install and the
Project F fix, all Action members, Galahad for technical assistance, Frank
for superb icons, Chris, Carlo and Xavier for supplying this great game and
the entire WHDLoad team!


Codetapper/Action (28-Aug-2005)


After 14 years, resuming work on that excellent patch (thanks to Codetapper making
source code public for whdload developpers as always, and such a clean code, so easy to change),
mainly adding CD32 joypad support for floppy and CD32 versions.
