Thanks to John Regent for disk image.

EXTRA NOTES:
Because some games operate on interrupts slightly differently than others,
I had to extend the base memory from 512k to nearly 772k.  This means that
the intro music will play properly without cutting out all the time.
Seeing as most people have a hell of a lot more memory than this install
requires, I hardly think its extravagant!

The secret game has been REMOVED!  For those that are aware, on the
original you would type 'Chrome' on the titlescreen.  This has been removed
for two reasons:

1) Codetapper of Action has already fixed this game seperately
2) It takes up over 100k of drive space

Hardly seems the point to duplicate the work of others!

The disk format was originally SS-MFM (Shaun Southern), I have ripped the
custom disk format to install the game as REAL files instead.

This install was done on a Amiga 68o6o, so I'm quite confident it will
work!!  :)

The Imager is written to take care of the GBH budget release, and whilst I
am sure Gremlin did not change it from the original release, you attempt to
install this game AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Have a merry christmas and a happy new year........ :)



NOTES V1.3 (StingRay)
---------------------
When I saw an updated version of the Switchblade 2 patch on the WHDLoad site
some days ago I checked it and first thing I noticed was the custom imager
used to read the disk. So I quickly made a RawDIC imager and when testing
it I started updating the patch code as well. The high score saving didn't
work properly in the previous versions (try it!) and has been redone, your
scores are saved correctly now! The name of the high score file has been
changed to "Switchblade2.high", it is NOT compatible with the old high score
file! I have also added a lot of trainers which can be selected in the
WHDLoad splash screen, the available in-game keys can be displayed by pressing
"Help" during the game. High score saving will be disabled if any trainer
options are used.

The pictures in the intro are shown for 5 seconds or until fire or either
mouse button is pressed.
