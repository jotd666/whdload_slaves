Version 1.4 (22.06.2022) done by JOTD:
- support for SPS version (SPSID 200). It was supported but crashed
  with an access fault when unpacking with MMU on because of RN unpack bug
- fixed install script (issue #0005704)

Version 1.3 (19.06.2022) done by JOTD:
- using fast memory for better speed, and 512k chipmem only
- fixes crash in options menu (issue #0003369)
- faster depack of main program (uses a modified RNC unpacker, file is seen
  as corrupt by standard RNC unpackers)
- quitkey on 68000 machines
- snoop bugs removed
- must register restriction removed
- source code included

Version 1.2 (2003) done by Galahad:
- MMU Snoop Bug fixed
- Old Debug code removed!
- Memory requirements reduced

Version 1.0:
- Full load from Hard drive (REAL Files)
- Load/Save/Delete Tournaments/Seasons to Hard drive
- Now you can save Options to Hard drive
- Depack routine relocated to Fast Ram
- Manual + Hints included
- You must be registered to play this install
- Quit option is 'F10'

Thanks to Codetapper and Toaks for mentioning that Sensible Golf utterly 
refused to work on their MMU equipped machines.  One piece of code was still 
accessing a disk routine that triggered a fault on MMU equipped machines, and 
the other piece of code was a piece of old debug code that I hadn't fully 
removed!  Everything now works as  it should on all Amigas! ;)  It's a little 
dissapointing  though when over 1200 people download the game, and only now 
does anyone say anything!

If you have already installed the game, just copy the slave file over instead
of reinstalling all over again.

EXTRA NOTES (Galahad):

Arghhhhhh!!!!! I had to totally recode the slave as I managed to overwrite
the original source code with something else!! :(

Still, its all redone, and another version supported, and you get some nice
icons from Frank ;)

You can only save your options (Menu Music, Ambience, Difficulty etc) when
you save a game.  The slave will then save out your chosen options.

45 Separate saves are allowed.

All files needed by the slave are generated on first runtime by the slave.

MORE NOTES (JOTD):

When saving a tournament, you have to quit whdload to be able to reload it the
first time you give it a name. Not a big deal, and Galahad did a great job on this
already this saving system is not so trivial to adapt to whdload.

This game uses Rob Northen compression (RNC) which has a lot of bugs, reading either too
far after unpacked data (preventing to create a proper 512k chip slave for a while) or
before start of unpacked program (for SPS "GOLF" packed version). The non-SPS version
has a "GOLF" packed version that no windows or Amiga unpacker (propack, xfddecrunch) can
unpack properly. The SPS version unpacks fine with those tools. Go figure...

Regards, Galahad, JOTD, John, Karpow and Frank.
