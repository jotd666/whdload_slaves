Amiga
-----

Firstly,  set up your Amiga according to the manufacturers instructions.
You  should  be  pretty adept at this by now.  I mean, they haven't sold
any  Amigas  for  about  a  year  now,  so  the  odds  are that you're a
long-standing owner.  Not that I'm getting at you or anything.  You have
a  perfect and inalienable right to be an Amiga owner.  Where was I?  Oh
yes.

Insert  Disk 1 into your Amiga's internal disk drive - and disk two into
your  external  drive, if you have one that is.  Let's face it, you'd be
hard pushed to insert a disk into a drive you haven't got.

Now for the tough bit. Switch on your Amiga.

Wait a short while.

Groove on down to the funky music.

Golf - A Quick Explanation For Aliens
-------------------------------------

The  game  of  golf  is  played  over a series of 18 "holes".  Each hole
consists  of  a tee area (from which the first shot is taken), a fairway
(a  long  stretch  of  grass) and a putting green (a very smooth area of
grass where the hole is).

The  idea  of  the game is to get around the 18 holes in as few shots as
possible.  Shots are taken by hitting a dimpled ball towards a hole with
a flag in it.

The  game  is  played  with  a  selection of large hitting sticks called
"clubs".    There  are  three  sorts of club: the iron, the wood and the
putter.   A wood is a powerful club traditionally used for the tee shot.
An iron is a mid range club used out on the fairway.  A putter is a flat
headed hitting stick which is used on the putting green.

Each  hole is graded according to the number of shots you can reasonably
expect  to sink the ball in - this is called Par.  Thus on a Par 4 hole,
you should expect to sink the ball in four shots or less.

Sensible Golf is Sensible Software's homage to the game of golf.

Some  25  golf  courses are at your disposal, none of which are based on
real  courses,  although  one of them looks a bit like Basingstoke Pitch

The  are  no  secret  moves,  hidden  levels  or power-ups in this game.
Similarly, you cannot 'be' Chun Li.

Playing  this  game  will not make you a better golfer in real life.  It
might, however convince you to take up a more stimulating hobby.

As you play Sensible Golf, you will not feel the-urge to say things like
Never  before has golf been so accurately simulated'.  Those have got to
be the most impressve SVGA graphics I've ever seen.   Finally a computer
golf  game  that takes you beyond the boundaries of your desktop or Golf

........................................................................


Quickstart - For Impatient Punters
----------------------------------

If  you're  itching to have a go of Sensible Golf right away, you should
choose  the  Play  Round  option from the main menu.  Click the joystick
button  to  bypass  the  Player Select screen and pick a course (Romes a
good place to start).

Once you're out on the course use up and down to choose a club, left and
right  to  choose  a  direction  and  the  fire  button  to  call up the
Welly-o-meter.    Now  press  the  fire  button again to start your back
swing.    When the indicator is at the appropriate strength setting, hit
the  fire  button again to start the down-swing.  Finally press the fire
button a third time in the middle of the red area to hit a shot straight
down the fairway.


Some Buttons That Do Things
---------------------------

Hitting  the  ball:  Press the fire button once to start the back swing.
When  the appropriate strength is reached press the fire button again to
start  the  down  swing.  Finally, press the fire button a third time in
the red zone at the bottom of the Welly-o-meter.

Changing your Club: To change club, move the joystick up or down.

Changing  shot  direction:  To change the direction of your shot, simply
move  the  joystick  left  and  right.   Note: if you heart after you've
called  up  the  Welly-o-meter,  simply  move  the  joystick   down   to
reposition.

Looking  at  the map: To view the map, hold down the fire button for one
second.  Pretty isn't it

To  quit  a  round:  Hit  the escape button and select Yes by moving the
joystick right.  Kind of obvious that one.


Some Options
------------

Menu  Music:  Toggle  this  on  and off if you want plinky new age music
playing whilst you navigate the menus.

In-Game Speech: Toggles the sampled speech on and off.

Background Ambience: If the birds are getting to you, switch them off.

Auto-Concede:  If  there's no way you can win a game, this function will
automatically concede the match for you.

Computer Difficulty: Toggle between Easy, Medium, Hard and Wicked.


Some More Options
-----------------

Save: If you're right in the middle of an amazing round and you suddenly
realise  that the pubs shut in half an hour save your game and come back
to it later.

Load: Fresh from the pub, load up your game again.

Format Save Disk: Click on this option, insert a blank disk and click on
continue to format a save game disk.

Delete  File:  Use  this  to  trash old games from your save game disk -
avoid accessing this option when you're just back from the pub.


Slightly  Slower  Start  -  For  the Sort of Punter Who Reads The Manual
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before Playing
--------------

Welcome  to  Sensible Golf, a Sensible Software game which simulates the
joys, trials, tribulations, and ups and downs of golf.  Where other golf
games go to extraordinary lengths to try and bring you the experience of
'being there' we realise that if you wanted to 'be there' then you'd 'go
there'.

So  instead  of offering you pixel perfect golf simulations of real golf
courses,  we  bring  you  the  real  joy of golf.  This game isn't about
chucking  bits  of grass into the air to check for wind speed.  It isn't
about resting your putter down on the grass to check out that green.  It
is'nt about minute alterations in foot stance.  This is about real golf.

Real  golf  involves hacking a ball about a tricky course that's riddled
with  hazards.   It's about aiming the ball way off to the left and then
violently slicing it around a tree clump.  It's about fun - not lawns.

The Game Screen
---------------

As you can see, the Sensible Golf in-game screen is a perfect example of
uncluttered  game design.  Notice the clever use of shades of green, the
dappled effect on the trees and those little clumps of flowers.

This  is  the  scoreboard.  You'll always find it in the upper left hand
portion  of  the  screen (assuming that you've got your TV the right way
up).  It tells you (from the top down):

Where you're playing
Which hole you're on
What the par for the present hole is
Whose turn it is
What their score is (so far for the round)
How many shots they've taken so far on this hole


........................................................................

Useless Golf Fact

Robert  Mitera  holds  the  record  for  the  longest ever recorded hole
in-one.    Thanks to a 50mph gust which carried his shot over a 290 yard
drop-off, he managed to hole out in one shot over 447 yards.

........................................................................


It's  always  worth keeping an eye on this ball indicator.  The position
of  the  ball  indicates  what sort of 'lie' you've got.  If the ball is
sitting  proud  of  the  grass then you'll be able to make clean contact
with  the  ball and hit a solid straight shot.  If, however, the ball is
recessed in the grass then you won't be able to hit it as far.

Beneath  the ball lie indicator you can see the distance left to play to
the  hole  (in yards) the club or iron that's currently selected and the
maximum distance that the club can send the ball (again, in yards).

And  here's  the  most  important  meter of them all, the Welly o-meter.
This  enables  you  to  hit  the  ball  with  the  appropriate amount of
strength.  By hitting the ball in the power zone (at the top of the semi
circle) you hit the ball at that club's maximum power.  So for instance,
if  you're  using  a one wood then hitting the ball in the red zone will
send it 240 yards.

The  area  at  the  bottonm  of the arc enables you to select draw (also
known  as  hook) and fade (also known as slice).  Hitting the ball right
in the middle of the red zone at the very bottom will send the ball on a
straight  line down the fairway.  Hitting it to the left of the red zone
will  send  it to the left and (surprisingly) hitting it to the right of
the red zone will send it to the right.

No  matter  how  crap you are at golf you'll be hard pushed to match the
record  set by a lady player in the 1912, Shawnee Invitational.  Her tee
shot  wound  up  in  the Binniekill River and the ball floated.  Being a
practical  sort of chap, her husband they put to sea and carry on.  They
eventually caught up with the ball one and a half miles downstream.  She
eventually  putted down in a very reasonable 166 - not bad on a 130 yard
hole.

........................................................................


Hitting The Ball In The Right Direction
---------------------------------------

Basically,  this  is'nt  as easy as it sounds.  Making the ball go where
you  want  it  to  takes  timing,  skill, concentration, precision and a
teensy  bit  of  luck.    However,  as  you've  probably figured out for
yourself, it's imperative that you learn how to position the ball in the
right place.

Dont  trust  the CPU : The computer will automatically point your player
in  the  direction of the hole.  However, there might be a large expanse
of  water  in  between you and the hole and if you simply take your shot
you'll end up in the drink.  Therefore, check the lie of the land before
you play and if necessary aim the ball in a different direction.

Master  the  red zone: The most important skill in this game is learning
how  to  stop  the down swing on the Welly-o-meter in the red zone.  The
important  thing  to  know here is that the harder you hit the ball, the
less time you'll have in the red zone.

Learn  to  swerve:  Learn  to  swerve the ball around nasty obstacles by
pointing the cursor in one direction and drawing or fading in the other.

To  putt  it  another way: The arrows that adorn the putting green arent
there  for decoration.  Learn to point the ball into slopes and remember
that  balls  roll  faster downhill than up.  Note: The previous sentence
was taken from an a GCSE physics text book.

The Map - Use It Or Lose It.
---------------------------

It  doesnt  take  much time and effort to call up the map (hold down the
joystick  button) but you can save yourself untold grief if you do.  All
the  nasty  hazards,  obstacles  and out of bounds areas are depicted in
full  colour  for  your viewing pleasure.  Remember you can also aim the
ball from the map screen.


Play Ball - Some Things You Should Know
---------------------------------------

In  order  to  get  a  good  score at Sensible Golf you should learn the
dynamics  of  the  clubs  you  use and the surfaces from which you play.
Whilst the CPU will automatically select a club for you, this may not be
appropriate for the lie of your ball or the obstructions in front of it.

Club Choice: For instance, let's say that you've played a lousy tee shot
that's  fired off to the right and the ball has come to rest in front of
some trees.  You've still got 28O yards to play and so the CPU picks out
a  1 Wood for you - not a good choice.  The wood is a heavy hitting club
which sends the ball far and low.  What you need (to get out of trouble)
is  a  club  which  will  pitch the ball up over the trees - such as a 7
iron.

Strength  Choices:  If  you're  anything  like  me then you'll a1ways be
tempted  to wang the ball as hard as you can.  This is not always a good
idea.   For starters, the Sensible tean have designed these golf courses
especially  for  heavy hitters.  This means that if you simply welly the
ball  down  the course you'll undoubtedly end up in either a) water b) a
bunker or c) some trees.  In golf, size really isnt important.

Draw  and  Fade:  When  you  first  start playing Sensible Golf you will
undoubtedly hit a fair munber of balls in completely the wrong direction
because  you misjudged when to hit the fire button.  Now whilst this can
be  very annoying under normal circumstances, drawing or fading the ball
is a very useful skill.

When you draw or fade a ball you effectively swerve it.  This means that
you  can  (with a bit of practice) project the ball around nasty looking
obstacles.   To see what I mean, try aiming the ball way off to the left
and  then  hitting it with loads of fade (to the right of the bottom red
zone).  Excellent, isn't it.

Hit  and  hope:  Regular  golfers  may be familiar with this phrase.  It
refers  to  those  shots  which you take without paying any attention to
club choice, shot strength, ball lie or direction.  This usually happens
after  you've  fluffed a shot five times in a four player match and your
mates  are  taking  the mickey out of you.  The hit and hope shot either
ends in complete disaster (in the water) or flukey victory (an obscenely
lucky hole down).  Either way if you find that most of your shots are of
the hit and hope variety, you should probably have a bit of lie down and
start a new round.

Reading  the  Greens:  Once  you  make  it  onto  the putting green your
troubles  are just beginning.  You see, putting the ball is a completely
different  skill  to  whacking  it  about  with  a club.  This is mainly
because  the  ball is always in contact with the grass and therefore any
dips,  rises  or dimples will affect where the ball goes and how fast it
gets there.  So spend a bit of time looking at those funny little arrows
-  they  tell  you  which way the green slopes.  Learn to curve the ball
around  the  lips  of slopes and you'll soon be putting like a pro.  Pro
golfer that is, not a lady of il repute.

Competition - Round, Tournament or Matchplay
--------------------------------------------

Once  you've learnt the ropes you might like to try and beat a friend or
the computer.  Here are your options.

Round

This is a good choice if you want to play a round yourself or against up
to  three  friends.  The advantage of this option is that you can choose
which golf course you'd like to play on.

From  the  main  options  screen  choose Play Round screen and you'll be
presented  with the player choice screen.  This is initially set to just
one  player  to  add others, click on the Type box and cycle through the
control methods (joystick 1, joystick 2, joystich 1/2) or the CPU player
mode (Easy, Medium, Hard, Wicked).

Once  you've  chosen  the  appropriate number of players, you can change
their  names  by  hitting  RETURN (surprisingly enough) on the Name box.
Enter a new name from the keyboard and hit return to store it.

Finally,  you  can  modify  each  player's appearance by clicking on the
little  man icon at the right of the screen.  Click on Hair, Skin, Shirt
and Trousers to cycle through all the possible options.

Once  you've  entered  all  the  players  you can choose whether to play
Strokeplay,  Matchplay,  (two players only) or Skins (two, three or four
players) tournaments.

Now  decide  which  course  you'd like to play on and you can start your
game.

At  any time you can hit the Esc key to return to the main menu and save
or quit your game.


Tournament

The  tournament  option  is perfect if you'd like to play a game against
friends in a tense knock-out style game.

First  of  all, decide how many players you'd like to be involved in the
tournament  -  remember  you  don't  determine  which  of  them  are CPU
controlled.

Now  move  the cursor up to the I hold down the fire button and move the
joystick left or right to select the number of players.

Modify  each  player's  characteristics  as  described in the Play Round
section.

You'll now see the main tournament options screen.

Decide  how many rounds (series of 18 holes) you'd like to play - either
1,2 or 4.

Toggle  Cut  on  or  off.   If the cuts turned off then all players will
qualify for every round.

Choose  the  number  of competitors - hold down the fire button and move
the joystick left or right to select the number of players.

Decide on the order of play - Seeded, Human Parties or Arcade.

Determine  the  maximum  number  of  players you'd like included in each
party - between one and four.

Finally  decide  whether  on  not you'd like to watch the CPU controlled
competitors  -  it  might get a bit boring if you're playing on your own
against 71 CPU controlled players, so choose wisely Luke.

Now you can pick a course to play the tournament at and tee off.


Season
------

If  you  fancy  playing  at  each  of  the  courses in Sensible Golf and
clocking up some prize money then have a crack at the tournament season.

From  the main menu choose season and then decide how many players you'd
like  to  be involved.  At this point you should decide how many of them
you'd  like  to  be  human  controlled and how many you'd like to be CPU
controlled.

You  should  now select the season options as detailed in the Tournament
section above

The  computer  will then take you to the first tournament of the season,
the Madeira Championship which has a total prize purse of $375.000


Some Golfing Words
------------------

Birdie: When you sink the ball in one shot fewer than par you're said to
have  got  a  birdie.    Not  to be confused with Bizet who was a French
composer.

Bogey: When you sink the ball in one shot over par.

Bunker: Sand pit for grown ups.

Draw: To swerve the ball to the left.

Eagle: When you sink the ball in two shots fewer than par.

Fade: To swerve the ball to the right.

Fairway:  The  long smooth stretch of grass that connects the tee to the
green.    Also,  what comes out of a lisper's mouth when they attempt to
say the word fairy.

Fore:  What  you're meant to shout when it looks like your ball is going
to land on someones head.

Green: The very smooth area of grass immediately surrounding the hole.

Gulf: Essex slang for the game of golf.

Hole:  The  crevice where the ball is supposed to end up.  Also the name
of Courtney Loves tedious band.

Lie:  The ball's position in terms of terrain.  For instance, a good lie
is on the Fairway - a bad lie is up a tree.

Matchplay:  Competition  in  which  players try to win individual holes,
irrelevant  of the number of shots it takes them to do it in.  If player
one  has  won three holes and player two has won none then player one is
said to be three up.

Obstacle:  Once  upon  a  time this referred to trees, bunkers and water
hazards that might get in the way of a shot.  These days its more likely
to refer to the 'travellers' who are camped out on the 14th.

Par:  The  number  of shots you can realistically expect to get the ball
down in.  Also, what Americans called their fathers.

Skins:  Competition  in  which  each individual hole on the course has a
prize  attached  to  it.  The player who wins the hole, takes the prize.
If  there  is  a  draw  then the prize money is carried over to the next
hole.

Stroke: A shot.

Strokeplay:  Competition  in  which the deciding factor is the number of
shots over or under par that you've played the course in.  For instance,
a  good strokeplay score would be -2 (two under par for the round) a bad
score  would  be  +4 (4 over par for the course).  Most competitions are
based around strokeplay.

Tee:  The area from which the first shot of a hole is played.  Also, the
surname of a famous American rapper whose first name is Ice.

Yard:  Pre-decimal  unit  of  distance.   One yard (pronounced yar'd) is
equivalent to 0.9144 metres.
