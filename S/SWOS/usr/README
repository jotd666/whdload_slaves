EXTRA NOTES:
These currently supported versions of SWOS have been tested on 68o3o
and 68o6o and now operate as they should.

45 Seperate saves are still allowed.

KNOWN BUGS:
SWOS still has one bug in the game which is present in the original.

If you want to view a HIGHLIGHT, you MUST have already loaded a game and
played!  It does not matter if you only play on the pitch for 2 seconds or
2 hours, the HIGHLIGHTS option expects you to have already loaded a game,
otherwise it will hang.

For purists of SWOS, you know this already ;)

NOTE FROM MAINTAINER:

 Version 2.0 has been adapted to use fastmem to overcome the most annoying
 slowdown bug on accelerated amigas. I didn't take the time to test all features
 (load/save) on all versions. That should work exactly as before. Please report bugs
 when found and specify your version if you can / attach the "SWOS2" file
