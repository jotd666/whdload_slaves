 version 2.3 (19.05.2024) done by JOTD:
 - fixed bug that crashed the game when tactic is changed/loaded (issue #0006185). The bug
   is there since the first version of the slave, but somehow hidden below
   another bug which also made tactics not useable.
 - england teams are now selectable again
 - game now looks in "data" directory for files, just like the installer copies them.
   so you can move back the files into a "data" folder, if you didn't fix that with
   a "data" tooltype already.

 - reworked file load/save completely (which fixed load/save tactic bug)

 - allows to load big team.xxx files (requires 256k more memory)
 - fixed install script
 - workaround for random access fault when selecting teams (not systematic)

 - german version supported (issue #0002640)
 
 version 2.0 (06.05.2021) done by JOTD:

 - quit key on 68000 machines (except for 1994 v0.9 version)

Their testing and patience have enabled SWOS WHDLoad to become a reality!

Thanks also to the MANY people that have sent email thanking me for
this install.

EXTRA NOTES:
These currently supported versions of SWOS have been tested on 68o3o
and 68o6o and now operate as they should.

45 Seperate saves are still allowed.

KNOWN BUGS:
SWOS still has one bug in the game which is present in the original.

If you want to view a HIGHLIGHT, you MUST have already loaded a game and
played!  It does not matter if you only play on the pitch for 2 seconds or
2 hours, the HIGHLIGHTS option expects you to have already loaded a game,
otherwise it will hang.

For purists of SWOS, you know this already ;)

NOTE FROM MAINTAINER:

 Version 2.0 has been adapted to use fastmem to overcome the most annoying
 slowdown bug on accelerated amigas. I didn't take the time to test all features
 (load/save) on all versions. That should work exactly as before. Please report bugs
 when found and specify your version if you can / attach the "SWOS2" file

 Version 2.2 has been improved by removing the complex (and probably cornercase buggy)
 Galahad cached dir version. Now teams can be edited, saved, and loaded back.
 While testing, I noticed a random bug. Game tends to crash with access fault when
 selecting a team. It's not that frequent, but it happens. I've tried to limit the impact
 of the bug, but if you see that the game is not behaving properly, just quit and restart.
 
 On this version, all user data (career, diy, tactics, ...) is saved in "SAVE" directory.
 When loading a tactic, other file types are shown (same as when operating from floppy).
 Just ignore them.
 
 This version also allows to load bigger uncompressed teams files without having to RNC-pack them. It
 doesn't remove the uncompressed size team limitation, though.
