NOTHING, NOTHING CAN PREPARE YOU!
---------------------------------
500 years ago, the shapeshifter Shang Tsung was banished from the Outworld
to the Morther Realm (Earth) fo his crimes.  There, with the aid of his
pupil, Goro, a hidoues half-human dragon, he was to atone for his crimes by
unbalanicing the furies of the realm, allowing his master Shao Kahn and his
minions to enter the dominion and rule forever.

He was defeated.

He returned to the Outworld a failure, facing execution at the hands of
Shao Kahn, supreme ruler of the Outword, the Astral Planes of Shokan and
the surrounding kingdoms.  With the apparent death of Goro, his fate seemed
sealed.  But Tsung told Kahn of his plan for revenge, a plot so evil and
twisted even Kahn was persuaded to grant him one final opportunity to
redeem himself.  He cleverly lured his adversaries to the bizarre Outworld
where they would face a new challenge - a tournament hosted by Shao Kahn
himself.

Today, the Tournament Begins...  Again!


LET THE TOURNAMENT BEGIN!
-------------------------
* Set up the computer as described in its instruction manual.  Player 1 
  plug your joystick into the port "1 JOYSTICK".  Player 2 plug your 
  joystick into the port "2 JOYSTICK".

* If your computer is turned on, turn it off.  Wait for at least 30 seconds
  before turning on your computer again.  This will remove any virus which
  may be present and so minimize the risk of infecting and possibly
  destroying your Mortal Kombat disks.

* Insert the Mortal Kombat disk 1 into the computers internal disk drive.
  The program will now load and run automatically.  When you are prompted 
  to insert the Mortal Kombat II disk 2 and disk 3 or disk 4, do so.

* You will know that Mortal Kombat II has loaded when you see the Title
  screen.

AMIGA EXTERNAL FLOPPY DISK OWNERS PLEASE NOTE:  Mortal Kombat II supports a
second, external floppy disk drive.

AMIGA 1200 OWNERS PLEASE NOTE:  The 2 button Joystick option does not
function on this machine.

AMIGA HARD DISK OWNERS PLEASE NOTE:  Mortal Kombat II cannot be installed
on a hard disk drive.

In the unlikely event that Mortal Kombat II fails to load, turn off your
computer and remove any extraneous external peripherals such as printers
(leave the monitor or television connected) before repeating the loading
procedure.

START GAME begins a one-player battle for the title of Grand Champion.
First however, a fighter must be selected.  The warrior selection screen
has pictures of all the warriors available to a player.

To select a warrior, move the coloured frame onto a warrior using the
JOYSTICK.  When your choice is framed, press FIRE to select him.

To select a warrior randomly, leave the frame on the initial warrior (Liu
Kang for player 1, Reptile for player 2) and press up and the fire button.

Should a second player desire to join the tournament, he may do so at any
time by pressing his FIRE BUTTON.  This will then return both players to
the "Choose Your Fighter" screen where they again must choose their
Warriors.  Both players may choose the same warrior.  When this happens,
the two will be distinguished by colour.  The players will then battle one
another with the winner continuing onward in the tournament, and the
losers game ending.

OPTIONS brings the player to the OPTIONS screen where a number of game
features can be modified using the JOYSTICK.

DIFFICULTY allows you to choose whether the game will be Very Easy, Easy,
Medium, Hard or Very Hard.  To set Difficulty, move the cursor to your
choice and press FIRE.  Then move the cursor to DONE and press FIRE.

CREDITS allows you to determine how many continues you may utilise before
your game is over.  To increase or decrease your credits, move the JOYSTICK
LEFT or RIGHT.  After choosing the desired number of credits, move the
cursor to DONE and press FIRE.

To exit the options screen and return to the main title screen, move the
cursor to DONE and press FIRE.

To PAUSE/UNPAUSE, press P on the keyboard.  To QUIT press Q while paused.


RULES OF THE OUTWORLD
---------------------
While the kombatants in the original Shaolin Tournament for Martial Arts
wagered their very lives upon their skill, in Shao Kahn's Outword
Tournament, they wager much more!!!

The Outworld tournament first tests a warriors fighting skill by putting
him again each of the formiddable Earth warriors.  In all Mortal Kombat
battles, meters in the upper-left and upper-right corners of the screen
measure the health of the warriors.

The meters begin each round completely green, but each time a warrior is
hit, an amount of red signifying the degree of injury is added to his
meter.  When a warriors bar becomes completely red, he is knocked out and
the round goes to his opponent.

Should time run out before either kombatant is knocked out, the warrior
with less injury is declared the victor.  The first warrior to win two
rounds takes the match and moves on to his next opponent.

NOTE:  If five rounds pass without a match winner, both kombatants will be
disqualified from the tournament.

Once a warrior has defeated the other kombatants in the tournament, he then
takes on the first of his Outworld hosts, the demon Shant Tsung.  His youth
restored by his master Shao Kahn, Shang possesses both powerful magic and
considerable physical skill.

Should a warrior defeat Tsung, his next opponent is the massive Kintaro.
Kintaro is of the same race of half human dragons which spawned Goro.
Enraged at his comrades death at the hands of a mere mortal, Kintaro sought
entrance to the tournament ot seek revenge.  Shao Kahn granted him this
privelege in exchange for his servitude.

Defeating Kintaro proves a warrior wothy of meeting Shao Kahn, supreme
ruler of the Outworld, in battle.  Defeat him to end his rule and become
the Supreme Warrior in the Outworld realm!


THE BASIC MOVES
---------------
The art of Kombat is as it has been for thousands of years.  A wise warrior
will begin his training with the art of defence.  Far more valuable than
learning how to inflict blows is learning how to avoid or deflect them, for
an opponent who attacks is an opponent who is vulnerable to attack.
Defensive lessons are as follows (based on default settings)

Left or right:           Move left or right on the joystick.
To block:                Move AWAY and press the FIRE button.
To crouch:               Move the joystick DOWN.
To jump:                 Move the joystick UP.
To flip forward or back: Move the joystick UP + LEFT or RIGHT.

Once defence has been mastered, a warrior can begin to learn the
fundamental offensive moves - the punches and kicks.  In combination with
strong defensive tactics, these moves are enough to defeat most foes.  The
fundamental offensive moves are as follows:

To punch (low):  Press the FIRE BUTTON repeatedly.
To punch (high): Press FORWARD or BACK + FIRE repeatedly.
To kick (low):   Tap the FIRE button + FORWARD or BACK.
To kick (high):  Tap the FIRE button.


THE ADVANCED MOVES
------------------
The advanced moves use the basic moves as building blocks to form powerful
manoeuvres.  However, although they do more damage, they also are slower.
The advanced moves are as follows:

To uppercut:               Press CROUCH + FIRE.
To foot sweep:             Press DOWN then AWAY.
To roundhouse:             Press AWAY + HIGH KICK.
To execute a flying punch: JUMP or FLIP + TAP FIRE.
To execute a flying kick:  JUMP or FLIP + HOLD FIRE.


SPECIAL MOVES
-------------
While being a master of Kombat may be enough to win any Earth contest,
winning a contest in the hostile Outworld requires more of a warrior.  In
preparation for this Tournament, every warrior has perfected several
special moves.  These moves often draw upon spiritual or supernatural
energies, extreme physical conditioning, or bionic implants for their
effectiveness, and can be especially potent, often devastating an opponent.


WARRIOR WISDOM
--------------
* Patience is a warriors greatest ally.  Wait for you opponent to attack,
  then counterattack him when he is most vulnerable.

* Timing is crucial to landing any moves.  Practice often to learn timing
  secrets.

* With Practice, combinations of moves can be learned which allow a warrior
  to hit his opponent several times before he has an opportunity to defend
  himself, making them an invaluable tool.

* Every warrior has different strengths and weaknesses in terms of speed
  and movement.  Discovering these styles allows you to both use them
  better and combat them better.
