Version:  0.9
Type:     game/patch

This patch applies to "Mortal Kombat" (c) 1993 Acclaim - 2 disks.
Thanks to Jean-François Fabre for the original JST install and rob2file
imager, and to Chris Vella and Carlo Pirri for sending the originals!

REQUIREMENTS:
- Slave requires WHDLoad V10+.
- Disk game requires 1Mb chip mem (+1.95Mb other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:
- Full load from HD
- RNC copylock removed
- Loads and save high scores (unless you cheat!)
- Decruncher relocated to fast memory
- 2 button mode bug fixed (thanks to Jeff)
- 2 Snoop bugs removed (move.b #0,$bfd200 and move.w ($6c,a6),(6,a5))
- RomIcon, NewIcon and GlowIcon (created by me!)
- Quit option (default key is 'F10')

CHEAT MODE:
- Taken from Sweet Cheater by Keith Krellwitz!

  On the screen where you select to start the game or options, type
  "CATHULU" and the new selection {CHEATMODE} will appear.  Enter the
  cheat menu and type "RJC" and a statistics screen will appear, press
  'SPACE' to return to selection menu.
  
  On the screen that tells you about {CODES}, type "VAMPIRE" the words
  will turn white and you should hear a sound.  This will turn off the
  blood (WHY!!).

The saving of high scores turned out to be a nightmare as the game just
hangs after saving due to the O/S trashing cop2lc.

There are still a couple of obscure access faults (present in the original)
so play the game without the MMU tooltype until I find time to fix them.
This should only affect the end sequence of some characters and also on
the Options screen, certain combinations trigger a fault.

Greetings to all Action members, my testing crew and the WHDLoad team!
Special greetings to Mad-Matt and Carlo for testing this fine game!
