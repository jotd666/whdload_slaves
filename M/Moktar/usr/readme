 This install applies to "Moktar/Titus The Fox" © 1991-1992 Titus.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.0 (2001) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - uses OSEmu
 - Music fixed (dbf loops)
 - Disk protection removed
 - 2 versions of Moktar supported, 1 version of Titus The Fox supported
 - Thanks to Frank and Exoticon for the nice icons

CD32 controls:

- Play: pause
- Fwd+Rev+Play: quit to workbench
- Blue/second button: jump. Note that to grab a ladder, you have to jump on it first, then use
  up to climb the ladder. The game is designed like that. Making "up" work on ladders from the start
  would require to piggyback on the level logical grid to check if a ladder is behind the character like
  the game does when the character is in mid-air. Doable but not worth the time...

Other keys:

- SPACE: close level codes screen, game over screen ...
- F1: lose a life
- F2: quit to menu
- F4: restart level
- F5: toggle music
- F7: toggle the filter.

There are too many moments where keyboard is needed, so I'm not doing a full 100% joypad game on that one.

Notes:

- Basically Moktar and Titus The Fox are almost exactly the same game.
  The game was originally released as Moktar, which is a character invented
  by a french "humorist", Lagaf. Then is was released abroad, and the Moktar
  character along with some musics and sounds were changed to a more neutral
  theme, and it became Titus The Fox (and last level was scrapped too, too "french"
  and not really interesting anyway with 2 "BARBES" (Paris district) signs and Lagaf
  posters. Wouldn't have fitted in the Titus game anyway.
- The game appears bland at first, but reveals a surprising depth IMHO with
  secret passages, a lot of funny items. Reminds me (loosely) of Magic Pockets,
  although the latter is a much better game.
- Coded by Carlo Perconti, a cross-platform prolific programmer from the 8-bit era.
  His games were average to rather good but he wrote so many, so respect man!
- the game engine looks very much like "The Blues Brothers" game engine too :)

enjoy
