 WHDLoad package.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly

 version 1.0 (19.02.05) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - decrunch relocated in fastmem (much, much faster)
 - cache enabled in chipmem for smoother scrolling
 - source code included

 note:

 Not great difference with 1st level of PAL versions. Even the teleports are there,
 but the bonus items are not visible in the status bar, so it is really hard to
 figure out which bonus is going to appear, thus making it impossible to create
 silver & gold stars at will. Furthermore, BK control is harder because jumping
 from a high floor is not good enough to roll and kill the baddies, only the
 tornado jump does.
 Gods demo was much more interesting...
