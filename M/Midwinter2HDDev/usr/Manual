                        MIDWINTER II - FLAMES OF FREEDOM
                        --------------------------------

     PRE-HISTORY:
     ------------

     CHAPTER 1 - THE YEAR 2099

     Chill blew the wind.

     The tiny figure on the makeshift bed wrapped his goose-pimpled arms
     tight around his torso. As he used his chin to inch the blanket closer
     to his neck, he shivered. And winced. The instinctive motion of
     bringing his knees to his chest only brought searing pain from his
     knee.
        He drew in his breath slowly, slowly. Alone in the single roomed
     shack,he knew that he was close to death. Whether the cold took its
     toll before they found him, and took more, no longer mattered.
        His eyelids fell. A normally vivid imagination struggled to conjure
     up the most familiar of scenes; the grey-haired man with the pointed
     finger, loaded and ready to fire another pearl of wisdom.

     "Davy, you are but a boy of twelve summers."

     "But Grampa, I....."

     "I know, little thing. You've not seen a summer yet. But be patient.
      Embers can be rekindled. Be patient. Just be patient."

     Patience was all Davy had left.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        He couldn't dream in greens, just greys. No voices in his head,
     just the crack of a rifle in a distant valley.
        He slipped and fell and was awake.

     "David, David, it's me, its Ginny." A gloved hand stroked his
     forehead.

     Peering through sore, cracked eyes he distinguished a golden curl and
     a bloody face. He jerked up and rocked back with the pain.

     "Easy David. Its over. You're safe. We're all safe". The comfort in
      the voice which normally made his heartskip a beat was strained
      almost beyond recognition. But it was her.

     "Hello chappie. We're come to take you home." John Stark, his hero.

     "And your Grampa's here. He's..... he's going to be alright."

     Davy's eyes flicked from Stark back to Virginia, and then past them
     both to where his grandfather stood, leaning against the doorway,
     staring in to space, muttering.
        Davy tried to speak but his lips froze. Another glance through the
     grown-ups failed to answer his questions. Virginia's face was cut and
     bruised. Captain Stark had his arm in a makeshift sling. His
     grandfather stood motionless, expressionless, save his mumbling.
        Davy wept. Frompain, from cold, from hunger, from relief. He sobbed
     long and hard. And he sobbed loudest of all as he realised that his
     childhood was over.

     "Welcome to Verde".

     A white uniform filled the patient's vision.

     "How do you feel?" asked the young nurse.

     De Falco blinked. He parted his lips to expel a barely audiable breath.

     "Where?"

     A frown sent pain from his skull through his neck and down his back.

     "Your craft. It was washed up here on Verde. What happened? You're in
      a right state".

     Her calming tones mixed statement with question, but De Falco only
     heard her prying.
        He remained silent. His evil provided the high-power fuel for his
     racing mind. Already he'd remembered the fine detail of defeat.
     Already he knew the source of his mistakes. He would speak only to
     the highest authority on whichever god-forsaken island he'd been
     dumped, and he told her so.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     The dozen men inthe bar of the Marianbad Inn sat silently, tears
     welling and chests bursting.

     "Come on, John", whispered the nearest to the radio set.

     "..and the battle of Shining Hollow was won..... The invading forces
      surrendered on the death of their leader and his generals. Our island
      is ours again. Fellow fighters, we have been through worse before..."

     Stark held his hand over the microphone to hide the release of another
     lachrymal sigh, and continued.
     "..and I fear we will encounter worse again. We must steel ourselves
      for the future. We have more discoveries to make. We have more to
      learn and more to teach our children.The coast of the Midwinter Island
      is not the edge of the world. It provides little defence from our
      enemies or the elements. A new day is dawning. A new fight must be
      fought. It will be long. It will be hard. And.... and it will be won".

     Drinks gently frothed as hands trembled. No man met another's eyes.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     "Quite frankly, Mr. De Falco, I find it hard to believe. Thousands of
      soldiers, and buggies, gliders, mortar shells - against a handful of
      troops, no matter how well trained. I suggest to you, candidly, that
      you need longer stay in our infirmary".

     President Blanco opened his palms as he spoke, exasperated at the
     wild-eyed visitor's outrageous claims.
        De Falco pursed his lips, and hissed;

     "Then perhaps you are lucky that we did not reach your island first.
      You would have provided easy pickings. The Midwinter Isle exists;
      it is there. It could be yours, with my help. Do you not need
     resources, do you not covet land?"

     The President grew impatient.

     "Look, De Falco, from whence you came I neither know nor care. You
      obviously know little of me or my people. We struggle for freedom
      everyday. East of us lie islands threatened by a brutal regime.
      South of us warfare abounds. The inexorable spread of the Saharan
      Empire will,one day, reach our shores. We are not interested in
      causing conflict. We seek only alliance and trade with neighbours.
      War is neither desirable nor affordable. If you are not suffering a
      reaction to your ordeal, I suggest that you seem to be the most
      injudicious of men. I am afraid that, if you will not accept
      treatment, I must you to leave Verde at your earliest convenience".

     De Falco clenched his teeth. His eyes burned. He focussed them on
     Blanco, who held his piercing stare for a moment.

     "Farewell, Mr De Falco", bade the President.

     The saliva struck just below his left eye.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     CHAPTER 2 - THREE YEARS LATER

     Brightly shone the sun.

     Professor Kristiansen read the thermometer and scurried insideto plot
     the last of the month's readings on his charts. Hypothesis,
     observation, conclusion. Greenhouse, greyer outlook.
        Davy peered over his shoulder.

     "Well grampa, are you going to tell them yet?" sneered the gangly
     youth, his voice ranging from falsetto to bass within a sentence.

     Kristiansen quelled his gathering desire to put the boy in his place.
     There was so much of the old man in the new man. It never failed to
     sting him to the core.

     "Davy, how can I tell them? How do you explain that our homes, their
      lives and the whole damn adventure is threatened. It's not like
      three years ago. It's not an extinguishable force this time".

     "So its even more important to warn them. John knows we're worried.
      People can see that Harper's Lake has grown to threaten the village.
      People know, grampa, people know".

     The pleading tones of youth, the flooding memories of the old man, the
     pain of the knowledge and the fear of the unknown. The bonds between
     them began to stretch.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     "Gentleme, we now turn to item 6.1 on todays agenda, 'Project Atlantic
      Explorer'. Dr. Grainger will speak tothe attatched paper".

     John Stark's voice boomed with increased authority.
        The twelve men of the Midwinter Security Council shuffled their
     documents nervously and turned towards the three newcomers.

     "May I introduce myself as Dr. Mark Grainger, Chair of the 'Atlantic
      Explorer' project, and my two assistants, Mr. Iwamoto and Miss Tambo.
      Nearly two years ago, we were charged with investigating the
      feasibility of the launch of an expedition to explore the Atlantic
      seas to the south-east of Midwinter. The project was initiated at
      your request after the events of three years ago, with two main aims.
      Firstly, to investigate the possibility of colonising any landfalls
      within easy travelling distance, in the hope of easing the pressure
      of the increasing population, forecast for our island within the next
      decade, and then to attempt to pinpoint the source of the erractic
      radio messages heard at that time. You have, of course, since been
      made aware that these broadcasts have discontinued ".

     "My two colleagues here today have been instrumental in facilitating
      the formulation of the proposed action outlined in the report.
      Mr Iwamoto has co-ordinated the development of the water-borne
      transport experiments, utilising much of the hardware abandoned by
      the invasion force, and has been liaising closely with the team
      concurrently investigating powered aerial transport".

     "Miss Tambo arrived on the Midwinter Isle some eighteen months ago
      following the sinking of a ship from the African port of Dakar.
      From Miss Tambo's condition on arrival, our medical staff believe
      that she had been drifting on a raft for several weeks. Miss Tambo
      has assured us that the ship was within sight of land when it went
      down. Examination of all available evidence has led us to the
      conclusion that it was not the Midwinter Isle which they had sighted.
      Miss Tambo has further presented us with detailed accounts of life
      in Africa, and has, like Mr.Iwamoto, valuable and interesting
      information to relay to you today".

     "Gentlemen, if you could turn to page 4 of the report, I will begin
      our presentation in detail."

     John Stark flicked through his papers. It was a detailed report. But
     he knew that however long Grainger spoke for, the arguments would rage
     much longer. He drummed his pencil on the table, determined to resist
     the calls for exploration.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     The stench in the streets of Dakar was a heady cocktail of decay and
     disease, despite the teeming rain. Field-Marshall Franklin Ngcobo was
     soaked through to his skin. At the end of his 1500 mile journey, it
     had taken a bare half mile walk through the streets to complete his
     discomfort. Now, standing on the dockside, he gazed across the water;
     from the ships laden with troops in the foreground, to the waiting
     adventure beyond the horizon.
        A voice behind him jolted his mind back to reality.

     "Franklin, its good to see you. Pleasant journey?"

     "Good evening, General. No it was not. Over one thousand miles to wave
      goodbye to you is not, with all respect, what I would call pleasant."

     Realising that that sounded Harsh, Ngcobo forced a grin.

     "Everything is set, sir. The forward party have weakened resistance on
      Ghazal, and have, this afternoon, regrouped to set sail for Beni
      Mazar. I am sure that our leaders in Tamanrasset will be pleased."

     The General's pompous air further clouded Ngcobo's skies.

     "General, for a man who has been with the Saharan Empire only two
      years, you carry much responsibility. You have your orders. Ghazal
      is rich in minerals. It is the ore we are going to exploit, not her
      people. Ensure that it is so".

     Ngocobo paused for a second, assessing the impact of his instructions
     on the twitching man.

     "Report back every two hours".

     His impatient subordinate grinned.

     "Of course, sir". He knew that he had his power back, the energy
     driving the lies which tumbled freely from his lips.

     A young sergeant hailed them from fifty yards.

     "General De Falco, we are waiting for orders".

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     "They agreed to it Olaf. They damn well agreed to it". Stark's
     exasperation made the professor's task all more difficult.

     "Well, John, it may be for the best in the long run. We can't predict
     the future,after all, we can only make judgements based on all the
     available evidence".

     Kristiansen trod a fine line, placating Stark's anger whilst paving
     the way for his own bombshell.

     "But it's madness. They're dreaming of a pot of gold at the end of a
      rainbow. Fool's gold won't buy food!" Stark was not in a mood to be
     reasoned with.

     Kristiansen scratched his forehead and folded his arms. The giveaway.
     John Stark had known Olaf Kristiansen for thirty years and, despite
     the ups and downs, he could read the old man like a book.

     "Olaf, do you have something to tell me?: asked Stark gently.

     "Tes, Yes, I do, John. Sit down".

     For a fleeting moment, John perceived a sense of deja vu.
     It chilled him.

     "Go on", he croaked.

     "You know that I have been monitoring the climatic changes which we
      have all witnessed over the past three years. The physical
      manifestations are clear. Our lakes have risen and fallen seasonally.
      Now they flood regularly. The lowland snowfalls have melted quickly.
      Even compacted icewalls have begun to crumble in places".

     Stark nodded.

     "Tellme something new, professor".

     "Its not good, John. Its warming up. Its pace is accelerating.
      Drastically. For an island such as ours, there is only one way to
      go, and that is back from where it came. Back into the Ocean."

     Stark laughed nervously.

     "Get to the point", he pleaded.

     'The expedition is not an unaffortable luxury. It is a lifeline, John."

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     CHAPTER 3 - THREE YEARS LATER

     The rap of knuckles on the bedroom door brought him awake. The sound of
     the voice made him jump.

     "Davy, its gone eight. You're late". The teasing tones of Robbie Parris
     showed nosigns of suffering the hangover which beset his slumbering
     colleague.

     Davy formed a scathing reply, but before it could be delivered, he
     realised that he was not alone in his bed. His first nighton Verde had
     been a good one.
        He eased back the duvet and crept to the door. He opened it an inch
     and whispered,

     "Five minutes, mate. I'll see you downstairs".

     "Get a move on, lover boy. We've got a lot to do today".

     Davy shut the door and cringed. He was going to have to face a lot
     more of Robbie's sarcasm before last night was forgotten.
        As he dressed, he gathered his thoughts. The thoughts of a nineteen
     year old youth, on his first trip away from Midwinter. He'd heard so
     much about Verde from his grandfather, but he was not sure that the
     life he'd sampled here sofar was not the one which so excited the
     ailing geriatric.
        Davy had been sent by the Midwinter Trade Council, of which he was
     the rising star, to put the seal of approval on export and import
     agreements thrashed out over the past fourteen months. Robbie's role
     was to oversee similar talks on the relocation of the first thousand
     settlers. The two men were well briefed and eager.
        Having collected yesterday's quickly discarded clothes, he flipped
     open his briefcase to check that he had all the necessary documents
     for the day's business. His eyes fell on the note from John Stark,
     wishing him luck for the trip. Good old John, he had taken the last
     few years well, despite his initial judgements having been proved so
     drastically wrong. Davy thought it unfair that the man whom he had
     worshipped for so long now found that his wisdom met with scepticism
     more often than approval.
        But this was not the time for sentiment, it was the hour of action.
     All the negotiations had been smoothly talked to the verge of
     completion, all the well laid plans were about to come to fruition.
     The Midwinter Isle had found a much needed partner, and the future
     matched the weather. Brighter each day.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     The leather strap fizzed through the air before cracking against bare
     flesh.
        Convulsing against the stone slab to which he was tethered, the
     young man yelped. His wealds glistened in the rays of light piercing
     the gloom from the high window.
        Administering the final blowswas De Falco's privilege.

     "You are a lucky man", he hissed at the twitching body.

     "Other Dhafrans will find out how lucky in years to come."

     Another lash smacked home, splattering blood across the tiled floor.
     The prisoner's tortured body lay motionless.His luck had expired.
        De Falco turned to hand his instrument of torture to the waiting
     subordinate, who stood nervously nearthe door.

     "Clean up the mess in here and put the body on display. Make it clear
     that the Saharan Empire cannot be resisted. I want the last few
     renegades rounded up by nightfall".

     The soldier wiped his browand nodded obediently.

     "Then send notice to Tamanrasset that Dhafrahas fallen. Remind them
     that half the islands are now under our rule, and inform them of my
     recommendation that this island should be used to make firm our grip
     by the construction of a large militarybase."

     De Falco rubbed his stubbled chin thoughtfully.

     "And invite a delegation from Tamanrasset to the city of Quida in the
     north. Its timefor our leaders  to witness our efforts."

     He spun on his heels and left with a thundering laugh.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     The huge oak doors swung open and President Blanco strode purposefully
     forward, hand outstretched.
        Davy was, for a moment, more in awe of his surroundingsthan at the
     mountain of a man who was pumping his arm in greeting.

     "Mr.Hart, it is good to meet you. How is your grandfather?"

     "Good morning, sir. Theprofessor is, as always, stronger in mind than
      in body. He sends his regards."

     Good, good. Well, shall we sit? I am not as young as you, after all."

     Davy grimaced. He hated people remarking upon his lack of years. They
     always equated it with a lack of experience, not knowing that he'd been
     through more trauma before his teens than most witness in a lifetime.
        The President noticed Davy's discomfort.

     "Well, this is a long way to come to merely sign a piece of paper.
      What news do you bring from Midwinter?"

     "Mixed, sir, to be honest. The refugee list is over subscribed by a
      factor of five. Rumours have spread like wildfire that the island
      has less than five years before she is reclaimed by the seas. This
      has not been helped by your reluctance to negotiate Trade Agreements
      beyond this time. But we have much to offer you, as I know you have
      us."

     Blanco allowed a feint smile to play on his lips.

     "Your grandfather told told me that you speak your mind. How
      refreshing it is to hear that borne  out."

     "When time is of the essence, it pays to get to the point. We are
      looking to extend our agreements, once those on the table today have
      been ratified."

     "My friend, you must understand my air of caution. Trade of commodities
      must be two way. We are already offering you much in addition to our
      hand of friendship."

     "Indeed you are. But bonds may be strengthened in other ways. I heard
      that Dhafra fell last night. Perhaps it would be prudent to cast our
      eyes east in tandem. Once the swelling wave breaks, it is too late
      to start building a sea wall."

     The President chuckled.

     "An analogy constructed from both hind and foresight, I imagine. To say
      that we are not worried by events in the east would be untrue. To
      admit that we are unaware that your Security Council have more
      advanced military hardware than we do would also be a lie. As you say,
      perhaps we could discuss a more formal alliance. Will you make my
      willingness to discuss such things known to your people?"

     Davy nodded his agreement.

     "Naturally, any military treaties would be be for deterrent purposes
      only. Midwinter is not an aggressive nation. Nor is Verde. But
      together, our forces would form a strong line of defence."

     The doors behind them opened amd a smartly dressed woman of Davy's age
     entered.
        As she handed Blanco a note, Davy thought that she looked familiar.

     "Thank you Jutta.This is Mr.Hart from the Midwinter Isle. Are the
      Trade papers ready for his signature?"

     "Yes, sir. I'll have them sent in."

     She turned to leave, ignoring Davy's embarrassed motions to a handshake.

     "Jetta", snapped the President, "Mr.Hart is being polite".

     As Davy's eyes met hers, he flushed crimson.

     "Yes, sir. Davy and I met last night. There is no need for formality
      this morning."

     CHAPTER 4 - THREE YEARS LATER

     Every time a thought began to form, the 'bleep' of the heart monitor
     stifled it. He began to wish that the monotonous confirmation of the
     old man's tenacity in clinging to life would cease.
        How could he even entertain the thought! Davylowered his head into
     his hands, peering through his fingers at the shrouded figure,
     surrounded by banks of equipment which he had designed throughout his
     now ending life.
        Davy's head was a maelstrom of emotion, impatience, ideas and sorrow.
        His decision making powers were deerting his mind, just as his
     grandfathers breath was deserting his body.
        His quandary was immense. The old man's last request was to die on
     Midwinter. His only hope was to leave with the last of his people for
     the safe haven of Verde.
        The authorities were closing the medi-centre in twenty-four hours.
     Davy prayed that nature would pull the plug before he was forced to
     himself.
        He hadn't heard the doctor's entrance.

     "I'm so sorry, Davy."

     Davy recoiled from his thoughts, leaping back to the present. The
     silence which at last filled the room flooded his ears and brought a
     trickle tear of relief.
        He rose, crossed to the bed, and gently kissed  the lips of his
     grandfather's body.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     "You are dismissed, herewith. You will be taken back to Tamanrasset to
      await court martail. The catalogue of evil which you have perpetrated
      sickens me. What sort of man are you, De Falco?"

     De Falco widened the grin which he had fixed before the tirade from
     the Tuereg Prince had begun.

     "Sir, I am a man who has striven, over thirty years, to enable the
      creation of a new order which the predicament of our planet demands.
      There are those who's destiny it is to govern, and there are those
      only fit to be slaves. I am, admittedly, single-minded in my quest
      for power. I am on of the chosen few. I have facilitated the spread
      of your empire. I have enabled you to lay claim to forty islands,
      their people and their resources. I have dedicated myself to giving
      the Saharan Empire everything it covets. Now you betray me, Now you
      spurn me. Now you seek to undo all that I have done. We are but one
      step from taking Verde and Midwinter. What I am not, is lacking the
      moral fibre which you and your like are. Tamanrasset has its salves.
      Tamanrasset has its natural order. Now I have given order to the East
      Atlantic. I will be remembered as the greatest son of the Saharan
      Empire. Your epitaph will, I am sure, remember tou as one who
      hindered rather than helped."

     Prince Sendero, heir to the Tuereg throne, was caught in two minds.
     Should he have De Falco executed immediately, orwas heto follow his
     father's advice and send the maverick back to Tamanrasset to be
     killed?
     He pondered awhile, chiefly to allow himself time to choose his
     words carefully.

     "De Falco. You are correct in stating that a new order has to be
      imposed. However, you no longer have a part in our plans. We have
      used you to get ourselves into a position of strenght. We believe in
      an ordered society. We have our slaves. The islands will be nurtured
      as slave colonies. You will be amongst their number."

     "You have overstepped the mark time and time again. The blood of a
      thousand people stain your hands. Your actions mean that the coercing
      of our new colonies into working for us will be difficult.
      We cannot exploit corpses. There are many fine jewels which are now
      ours. We have the task of cutting them into priceless gems. Such a
      process requires skilled craftsmen, not sadists armed with
      sledgehammers. Your time as a leader of the Saharan Empire is over.
      I have reconsidered my decision to have you sent back to the mainland.
      I will have the necessary papers drawn up to enable you to begin your
      new duties as my personal slave tomorrow."

     For the first time in years, De Falco's smile vanished.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Cheering crowds, vehicles bedecked with bunting and the beat of
     marching drums filled the teeming streets of Union.
        The carnival atmosphere floated through the first-floor window of
     President Blanco's office where he sat, in full uniform, putting the
     finishing touches to his soon to be delivered speech.
        Next door, in the government chamber,over one hundred dignitaries
     and officials from the former islands of Midwinter and Verde chattered
     excitedly, toasting the birth of a new beginning with fine wines.
        He ran through his text for the final time.

     "People of Agora, today we celebrate a landmark in time. The coming
      together of two tribes in peace, friendship and prosperity. Yesterday
      is history, tomorrow another day. Today, let us not ignore the
      lessons of the past, nor deny the uncertainty of the future. Let us
      celebrate, reflect, and plan."

     "Celebrate our freedom. Enjoy the mutual benefits which our former
      islands bring each other. Give thought to the opportunities afforded
      us."

     "Reflect on the struggles along the road to where we are. Remember the
      pain and suffering endured by our forefathers. Never forget that we
      can overcome everything bar the passage of time."

     "Plan carefully to maximise potential. Fear not what time has in store
      for us, but be mindful of the dangers we face. And prepare yourselves
      to be part of Agora's future."

     "Just over the horizon lies danger. The Saharan Empire show no mercy
      to the weak. Our economy must be developed, education and training
      must be advanced, and our defences must be strengthened."

     "It gives me great pleasure to announce to you the information of the
      Atlantic Federation. We aim to build from our base here on Agora,
      strengthening our trading links with the islands suffering at the
      hands of the Saharan Empire, and encouraging them in whatever ways
      possible. We will negotiate with the Saharan regime, in an attempt to
      bring peace and prosperity across the Atlantic.
      The Earth is, at long last, beginning to bear fruit again. Let us
      spread our harvest wide. May the Atlantic Federation be a vehicle of
      progress, a force for liberty, and a spark which lights the flames
      of freedom longing to melt the last of the ice away."

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Peering into the gloom, the guard blinked his eyes as he tried to focus
     on the bed in the corner of the cell. It was empty.

     As panic set in, the dull thud to his left set the guard's eyes turning.
     Stepping into the darkness, he looked up towards the sound.De Falco's
     body swung gently against the wall, hung high, sheets knotted to the
     air vent.

     It was the guard's turn to smile.

     SAHARAN COMMUNIQUE OFFERS PEACE HOPE

     Union, 1 January, 30

     The President of the Atlantic Federation today revealed that he has
     received a "New Year's Greeting" from the leader's of the Saharan
     Empire, in which they speak of "A new epoch of hope, peace and
     co-operation" over the coming years. It is believed to be the first
     direct communication from the Empire for eighteen months, and its
     tone and content have sent shock-waves through Government cicrles.
        Speaking at a hastily arranged briefing, President Blanco told
     waiting reporters that he was both "excited and amazed" at the
     apparent about-face detailed in the communique, coming as it does
     less than a month after reports of massive troop build-ups on Dhafra.
        The Empire have offered to build both Trade and Diplomatic links
     with the Federation, in the hope that "mutual understanding will lead
     to financial and military stability throughout the East Atlantic".
        In his announcement, The President said that he "welcomed the
     appearance of reason after far too much time spent eyeing each other
     as alien races", and that he would be replying to the message in "the
     most positive way possible".
        However, late last night in Townsville, it was becoming apparent
     that The President may be isolated in his views. The Security Council
     offered "no comment" to the suggestion that the Saharan Empire may be
     using this tactic to weaken resolve amongst the Agoran people, which
     was quickly followed by increased speculation that the predicted
     arguments over proposed increase defence spending from next month
     may be set to take a new turn.

     IS THE COLD WAR COMING TO AN END?

     From Our Political Correspondent, Henri Lafayette

     "It had to happen. The strenght of the Atlantic Federation has grown
      and held its own in the face of all threats from the East.
      The Saharan Empire must know that their furthest flung outposts, our
      nearest neighbours such as Panao, Vicenza and Gamboa, are unmanagable
      without the financial input that trade with Agora offers."
        Such were the bullish tones of President Blanco yesterday. The
     questions now to be answered are even more numerous than those begging
     response before receipt of the communique. What exactly are the
     Saharans planning? How do they envisage Agora's position alongside
     the dictatorship imposed on the Slave Isle?
     And, perhaps the most pertinent question of all is to ask ourselves
     'Do we trust them?'.
        So deep is the resentment of the Empire buried in our society, so
     strong the feelings of revusion at their capture of the Slave Isles
     two decades ago, and so consistent the line of anti-Empire propaganda
     flowing from The President himself throughout his Premiership, it
     seems inconceivable that the past can be forgotten and new partnerships
     forged.
        But, if our leadership is to be believed, this is the opportunity
     of a lifetime, to be grasped with both hands. We must hope, for the
     sake of the Federation and all our people, that the hands which grasp
     are not severed at the wrist by an enemy which, in the past, has not
     found itself wanting in the dirty tricks department. Let us join
     The President in welcoming the initiative. But, as he once said
     himself, "Let us not ignore the lessons of the past, nor deny the
     uncertainty of the future".

     MALARIA SCARE RESURFACES ON PANAO

     The Daily Correspondent has learnt from an Agoran citizen in hiding on
     the Slave Isle of Panao, that fears are growing that the malaria
     epidemic of thity years ago may be set to take hold once more. Medical
     facilities on the island have, we understand, asked for immediate
     assistance from the Saharan authorities, in order to curb the rising
     danger. Its proximity to Agora led to all fishing wessels being banned
     from entering our waters during the last outbreak, which because of
     the intensity of the fighting against the Saharans on the island at
     the time, caused great consternation for our government.

                                 THE MESSENGER

                             "Telling it how it is"

                   DON'T TRUST THEM - Saharan Dogs Will Bite!
                   ------------------------------------------

     The Agoran leaders were plunged into a new fight with the barbaric
     Saharan regime yesterday as they sent us a "peace message"in an attempt
     to con us into becoming friends.

     Despite years of blopdy slaughtering and the maiming of innocent men,
     women and children, President Blanco last night said that he was ready
     to talk to the madmen of Tamanrasset!

     The message was the first time that Agora has officially heard from the
     Evil Empire in over a year, in which time they have continued to rule
     with an iron fist over the Slave Isles.

     Only last week, our intelligence in Dhafra spoke of a huge build up of
     soldiers, guns, and tanks. The Saharan Empire are completing their
     evil schemes to attack Agora, and have abviously used the "peace
     message" as a cover for their plans.

     The Messenger, speaking as it does on behalf of the citizens of Agora,
     is proud to tell President Blanco that we are ready to fight off the
     Evil Empire even if he is willing to be tricked into becoming their
     friends.

     TOP COP BRANDED TRAITOR

     A high ranking Federation Law Officer has defected to the Saharan
     Empire whilst engaged in undercover work on Iquitos. Agent Raj Nazir
     found the highlife enjoyed by wealthy Saharans too much to resist when
     offered a new house and job on the holiday haven. He is now spilling
     the beans to the local Saharan authorities in exchange for money and
     luxury goods. When we contacted the headquarters of the Federation
     Security Council in Union, we were allowed only to speak to the
     Personnel Officer, who told us that "Agent Nazir is no longer in our
     employment. His whereabouts are the subject of much speculation, but he
     knows nothing which could damage the Federation or its people". Nazir
     left behind his wife and two children, who were last night "resting
     with friends".

                         Jibaile, Corozal, 8 January 30

     President Blanco,
     Atlantic Federation Government Buildings,
     Townsville,
     Agora.

               Mr.President,
                            I pray that this letter reaches you, for in
     writing it I endanger the lives of many. News has reached me of the
     Communique issued to your Government by the leaders of the Saharan
     Empire, and your apparent response. As the leader of the illegal
     Corozal Democratic Party, I beg you to set your face against the
     blantant untruthfulness of the message. On Corozal, we made the mistake
     of allowing the Saharan Empire to gain creedence when they first
     approached us nearly twenty years ago. They abused our trust, flouted
     all decency, and now impose the strictest denial of human rights on our
     people, backed by the threat of further military action if we do not
     comply with their every command.
          More of our people are transported back to the African mainland
     as slaves every day. The Empire is ruled by men who will go to any
     lenght to extend their domain. I know that they covet Agora as the
     jewel in their crown. Not only are the Atlantic Federation in control
     the last free island in the East Atlantic, they are also the only hope
     remaining for the millions of Slave Isles citizens who long for
     emancipation.
          With every breath in my body, I plead with you not to befriend the
     Empire. If you do so, Agora will fall. There are alternatives which do
     not involve full-scale military confrontation, although I understand
     that you feel it to be inevitable unless you reach compromise with the
     Empire.
          Corozal is lucky to be home to men and women who are never prepared
     tolay down in the face of injustice. We have cultivated and intricate
     network of undercover intelligence operatives whose task is to make
     life as difficult as possible for our oppressors. Instead of embarking
     upon a futile quest for intercourse with the desperate men of the
     Saharan Empire, I suggest to you that an alliance with the downtrodden,
     but not beaten, people suffering at their hands is the only course of
     action which will, in the long run, bring peace and prosperity to the
     East Atlantic, and, to be quite candid, is the only option which will
     save your island from befalling the same fate as Corozal.
          I am sure that, if you wish to enfafe in further dialogue, you
     will be able to contact me.

                      Yours truly in peace and friendship,

                                  Badzal Zola.

       Extract from the minutes of the Atlantic Federation Grand Council
                            meeting, 15th January 30

           Item 5.0: "Intelligence Gathering - A Plan for the Future"

     The Council was addressed by Commander Blair, Deputy Chair of the
     Atlantic Federation Security Council, who spoke to his tabled paper.
     In outline, the paper proposed the formation of a new department
     within his organisation, charged with recruiting, training and
     utilising a squad of Agents for placement upon the Slave Islands, with
     the aim of soliciting and gathering information pertinent to Saharan
     Empire activities, and to seek out and liaise with known activists
     working to undermine the Saharan Empire's activities. Such a body of
     men and women would be answerable directly to the Grand Council via the
     Security Council Chair and Federation President, and their work would
     at all times be classified, confidential, secret, and subject to the
     highest security clearance.

     The paper received the full support of The President, who assured the
     Council that hisremarks of earlier in the month had been
     misinterpreted, and he in no way sought to forge alliances with the
     Saharan Empire.

     Points of enquiry were raised by several Council members, which
     focussed on the day to day proceedures to be adopted by such operatives
     whilst on assignment, and on the calibre of Agent available for such
     missions.

     Commander Blair explained that the Field Agents would be put in place
     on each of the islands, with the aim of preparing information for return
     to Agora, which would be disseminated by the Security Council. A top
     tier of Agents would be on constant alert on Agora, who would provide
     help and back-up to Field Agents as requested, travelling undercover
     to any of the Slave Islands requiring urgent assistance.

     The Agents were to be recruited carefully from existing Security
     Forces, and, in addition, from the limited number of Federation allies
     throughout the East Atlantic.

     With the proviso that Commander Blair return to the next meeting with
     detailed organisational structures for final approval, the document
     received assent by seventeen votes to nil, with two abstentions.

               Item 6.0: A vote of confidence in President Blanco

     Subsequent to the earlier discussions regarding President Blanco's
     statements about the Saharan Communique, it was accepted by the
     proposers that this item be dropped from the Agenda.

     President Blanco accepted the Council's warnings as to his future
     conduct in such matters.

        Dear Ken,
          The bait was taken. The day after the first reports reached the
     President, the Airship base on Maji was stuffed with troopes, all
     heavily armed, and a five mile cordon was thrown around the base.
     The following day Professor Challenger was rooted out and is believed
     to have been killed. Having found the leak, Commander Blair wants it
     plugged a.s.a.p. The method is open to discussion, but it looks messy.
     Blanco is on his way out, that much is sure, but they are really
     baying for his blood over here. Show trials and extradition at best,
     the moment the 'hangers' have been waiting for at worst.

              Can you get in touch tonight to smooth things over?

                              -------------------

                                BLANCO RESIGNS!
                        SPY SCANDAL ROCKS THE FEDERATION

     Henri Blanco has resigned as President of the Atlantic Federation, in
     cicumstances which are leading to incredible speculation that he is an
     agent of the Saharan Empire.
        The magnitude of his treachery is not yet clear, but to have a
     traitor as head of state certainly means that our nation state is in
     perilous danger of foreign intervention.
        Mr. Moshe Sarid, the deputy premier, revealed the worldshattering
     scandal with the words; "One man may have taken us to the brink of
     destruction". Such terms may appear to overstate the dire predicament
     of our nation, but, as President Blanco will have had access to every
     single piece of intelligence and Gouvernment information for over
     twenty years.
        How long he has been in the pocket of the Saharan Empire is unclear,
     but, in an effort to prevent widespread unrest amongst Agoran people,
     Mr. Sarid confirmed that he believe it to be "less than a six month
     period".
        The whereabouts of the President and his immediate family were kept
     a secret last night, but Security Council advisors and media
     representatives were calm, positive, and obviously well briefed.
        It may well be the case that the Security Council have been keeping
     close checks on the ex-President for some time, which would explain the
     apparent calm with which they are handling this devastating news.
        The problem over the coming months will no doubt be to ascertain
     just how much Blanco has fed to the Saharan Empire, and now Agora and
     the Atlantic Federation can restore confidence in their security and
     intelligence operations.
        Last january, Blanco caused uproar following his reaction to the
     "Peace Communique" from the Saharan Empire. His actions may now be seen
     in a different light following these amazing events. Blanco was a man
     with corrupted values and dishonest aims. If his point of view at that
     time had held sway, his discovery as a spy now would be all the more
     damaging. Luckily, the Atlantic Federation took the initiative away
     from Blanco by producing alternative policy decisions, forcing him to
     support them, which have led to a strenghening of Security Forces, and
     limiting his influence. It may indeed be the case, if rumours from
     Government circles are correct, that the heightened Security position
     finally led to Blanco's exposure for what he is - an enemy of the
     state, condemned by his own admissions to confinement for the rest of
     his life.

                              THE SECRET OF STATE
               From our Political Correspondent, Henri Lafayette

     The evidence against ex-President Balnco, gathered by the top Agents of
     the Security Council, will have been seen by very few people.
        The same will be true of the information passed by Blanco to the
     Saharan Empire. The knowledge of what has been leaked, and its
     political, economic and military importance, is the privilege of very
     few.
        The deputy premier's remarks that Blanco may bring Agora closer to
     suffering foregin intervention smacks of one without that privilege.
     The real power brokers behind the throne are unlikely to be members of
     the Government. They are the Chief Officers of the Security Council.
        This small band of hand-picked military and intelligence elite are
     mentally in the front-line of a war in which, as yet, no shots have
     been fired. Blanco's disclosures may well bring conflict into sharper
     focus in these men's mind, but the how, when,and where of war will have
     been their centre of attention throughout their careers.
        These men are the players in a massive underground Chess game, only
     brought to light when our side lost, let us pray, not their King, but
     their Queen.
        The number of lesser pieces left the Federation's disposal is
     unknown. But one thing is. The chance of stalemate in this game of
     Atlantic power-politics is virtually nil.

     Salvatore Bella.
     COBRA Agent j89/e

        Dear Agent Bella,
          It was most interesting to meet you yesterday. In the light of
     your information gathered regarding "Operation Scorpio", I have
     arranged for you to meet Commander Blair on Friday, here, at 1445
     hours.
          Since then, I have received corroborating information from an
     Agent on Ghazal and am currently seeking urgent contact with all
     Agents on assignments based on eastern islands. If, as it appears,
     the Saharans are preparing to launch an attack from the mainland,
     my soundings with strategists here at HQ are pointing to a minimum
     of one years delay in building sufficient troop levels from the
     Empire's current levels around Dakar.
          It is of no doubt in my ming that the Saharan Empire lust after
     our island. I believe that we may, thanks to your vigilance, have
     gained enough time to combat it. The Commander would welcome a
     discussion regarding potential strategic paths on Friday. We must
     tread a fine line between preparation for war and avoidance of its
     precipitation.
          Intelligence gathering is now at a premium. As such a valued
     agent, I am sure that you will appreciate that we need you in the
     field. Will you therefore prepare to leave Agora next Monday on
     assignment. You will be fully breifed after your meeting with
     Commander Blair on Friday.

                                Yours sincerely,
                                Stefan Lubovski
                         Director of Field Operations,
                                     COBRA.

     FLAMES OF FREEDOM OPERATIONS HANDBOOK

     This handbook is designed for the use of COBRA field operatives
     seconded to Operation Wildfire. It provides details of the history of
     the conflict between the Atlantic Federation and the Saharan Empire,
     information on the 41 islands of the region, full technical
     specifications for transport, armaments, sabotage techniques, and
     provides information for a range of situations likely to be
     encountered throughout the operation.
        Its contents are Top Secret and Higly Classified. You are
     privileged to have access to this sensitive material. Please take
     care of it.

                                   Good Luck.

                                    CONTROL

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        HOW TO USE THE HANDBOOK

     There are several ways to learn your craft as a Field Operative, and,
     whilst trying out and learning the game, you are also encouraged to
     familiarise yourself with the layout of the Handbook.

      _ -----------------------------------------------------------------
     |_|  Those agents who wish to get into the thick of the action as
          quickly as possible, follow the "Firefight" route. Those pages
          and chapters which are essential reading for this route are
          marked by a square.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        -----------------------------------------------------------------
     /_\  Those who wish to sample more of the tactical elements, as well
          as the action, but do not want to see the full range of game
          options yet, follow the "Raids" route. Those pages and chapters
          which are essential reading for this route are marked by a
          triangle.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        -----------------------------------------------------------------
     ()   For those wishing to try the full game from the start, playing at
          the strategic, the tactical and the action level, every page
          becomes essential reading. This is marked with a circle as the
          "Campain" route.
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     When you first play "Flames of Freedom", select the "Firefight" route.
     You may not find life easy. You may not even survive. But you will know
     what an action-packed challenge you're facing!
        After a short while, you'll want to know more about the range of
     options available to you from a strategic angle, whilst guaranteeing
     that the mistakes which you are bound to make whilst learning do not
     prevent you from winning the game eventually. "Raids" allows you to do
     this.
        Finally, when you are ready from the ultimate challenge, in which
     every decision you make could have a bearing on the outcome, and where
     the more knowledge you have, the better your chances of success, you
     should read every page, via the "Campaign" route.
        The handbook is divided into 20 chapters, each dealing with a
     specific area of your work. The first 8 chapters explain how to prepare
     for missions, and describe the workings of your Head Quarters. They
     provide everything you need to know about getting started, and will
     best serve you in the order in which they appear.
        The second section of the Handbook covers all aspects of your work
     in the field. The order of events whilst undertaking a mission will
     vary with each mission, mostly determined by you, but sometimes by fate.
     You will find the second section at its most useful if you reaf each
     Chapter when it becomes relevant during the game.

        For a very brief description of any terms which are used during
     the game please consult the Glossary on page 160.
        Finally, a section is provided at the back of the Handbook for
     notes, but do not think that every piece of information you receive
     must be noted down. Nearly all of it will be accessible on-screen, via
     the Function Keys. It is therefore important that you get your
     Keyboard Overlay to hand now.

     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
     ---------------------

     THE ATLANTIC FEDERATION AND AGORA

     Our Atlantic Federation was formed in 2018 by the political inification
     of the nations of Verde and Midwinter, following the partial
     destruction of the Midwinter island by rising sea levels. Its guiding
     aims were to form binding economic and political ties between the
     people of Midwinter and Verde, and to extend the hand of friendship to
     other nations, countries and islands.
        The island of Verde was officially renamed Agora, from the meeting
     place in Ancient Athens, the birthplace of democracy. With the final
     disappearance of the Midwinter island, Agora became the home of the
     Federation and her people.
        Agora is the most westerly of 42 islands which stretch in a broad
     band to the African mainland. Our neighbouring islands have, for thirty
     years, been controlled by the dark forces of the Saharan Empire.
     Intelligence reports lead us to believe that their next target is
     Agora itself.

     THE SAHARAN EMPIRE AND THE SLAVE ISLES

     Life for most people on the Saharan controlled islands is, in the
     main,atrocious. Hundreds of thousands have been transported back to
     the African mainland as slaves, and those still living on the islands
     are under the total control of the Saharans, working in a variety of
     ways to serve the Saharan Empire's desires for economic, political and
     military strength.
        The threat to Agora is taken very seriously. A small number of COBRA
     Field Agents, placed by the Atlantic Federation Security Council on the
     islands have been working undercover for sometime. They have discovered
     plans for "Operation Scorpio", which we believe to be the code-name the
     Saharans are using for their attack on Agora.
        These same agents have also executed covert reconnaisance, allowing
     us to compile a fairly comprehensive picture of life on the islands.
     Resistance amongst the people of the island is at higher levels than
     we anticipated, and in many places, intricate networks exists, enebling
     the underground movements to engage in acts of sabotage and defiance
     against the Saharans. However, the resistance groups lack the training
     and resources necessary to instigate a full-scale uprising against the
     island authorities, and, as each island has diverse organisational,
     cultural, and political aspects, there has been no prospect of island
     resistance groups joining to form a pan-Atlantic anti-Saharan
     coalition.

     OPERATION WILDFIRE

     As the last island remaining free from Saharan domination, we have
     decided to launch a

                                      -Page 8-

     counter operation aimed at preventing the Saharan Empire from gaining
     control of Agora. This strategically planned series of missions is to
     be codenamed "Operation Wildfire".
        As one of the top COBRA agents available, you are to be sent from
     Agora to undertake hazardous missions which may cost you your life or
     your liberty. You are to aid the liberation of the Slave Isles by the
     completion of top secret missions which are designed to bring each
     island's local authorities to their knees, one after the other. Once
     local Saharan forces are weakened, the resistance forces will be able
     to gain control of the island.
        However, the Atlantic Federation must, at all costs, avoid provoking
     a Saharan backlash which could result in an immediate attack on Agora.
     It is therefore vital that the Saharan Empire believe that the
     uprisings are wholly caused by the inhabitants of the Slave Isles,
     and are not instigated by Federation Agents.
        The Saharan Empire is assembling a vast Armada all along the African
     coast. Eventually, the Saharans are bound to initiate Operation Scorpio
     and set sail to attack Agora. The more islands we can liberate before
     that time, the better our chances if withstanding attack, as the
     liberated islands will then contribute forces to our efforts to defeat
     the Armada. Once the Saharan Armada sets sail, no more missions can be
     completed. You must drop what you are doing, and join the attack on the
     Armada, with all possible speed. Although other Federation forces will
     be able to neutralise part of the enemy invasion fleet, your
     contribution to the counter-attack is vital.

     CHAPTER 1 - GETTING STARTED
     ---------------------------

     Execute the relevant Loading Intrsuctions before making your way to the
     Atlantic Federation Head Quarters on Agora, where you will be asked to
     perform a simple identification test for security purposes.

     COMMODORE AMIGA VERSIONS

     A Commodore Amiga with a minimum of 512K of RAM and a colour monitor
     are required. Flames of Freedom may be played via mouse, joystick or
     keyboard, but a mouse is recommended as the interface has been designed
     to take advantage of this method of control. When playing by mouse or
     joystick, some keystrokers will also be necessary.

     Turn of your computer and remove all unnecessaey peripherals.

     If your computer has KickStart in ROM, insert the Program Disk into
     the internal drive at the Workbench prompt - the program will then
     auto-load. Please follow any on screen prompts.
        If your computer does not have KickStart in ROM, load KickStart as
     normal, insert the Program Disk at the Workbench prompt and the program
     will then auto-load. Please follow any on-screen prompts.

     What if my Amiga software fails to load?

     In the vast majority of cases a loading problem is not because of
     faulty software, but either an incorrect loading proceedure or a
     hardware fault.
        Please ensure that the loading instructions have been correctly
     executed. The commonest hardware failures are due to a misalignment of
     the heads in the disk drive. Such faults may be detected by loading
     the game on another computer. (Either use a friend's machine or ask
     the software store from which the game was purchased to test it).
        Alternatively, a virus may have transferred into your hardware from
     another piece of

                                      -Page 11-

     software. Pirated copies of games are an incredibly common source of
     viruses. It always pays to own original software.
        In the unlikely event of a software fault, please return the
     complete package, with receipt to the place of purchase. MicroProse
     regret that goods cannot be replaced unless bought from the company
     directly.
        If you have any difficulty whilst loading Flames of Freedom, or need
     help whilst running the game, MicroProse will be happy to help you on
     the Helpline. Please ring (0666) 504399. Mon-Fri. 9 a.m. - 5.30 p.m.
     Please have a pen & paper handy when you call.

     CONTROL METHOD & SECURITY CLEARANCE

     Once you have successfully loaded the software, during which time you
     are taken to COBRA HQ on Agora, you will be asked to give your chosen
     method of control for the game.

        Press "M" to play by Mouse (the recommended method of control)
        Press "J" to play by Joystick.
        Press "K" to play by Keyboard alone.

     You must then abtain security clearence by correctly identifying the
     portraits of two members of the Saharan Federation Secret Police.
     A guide can be found on pages 139 - 144 of this handbook. To select a
     name, move the on-screen pointer over the name and press fire on your
     joystick, the left mouse button on your mouse, or the Space Bar on
     your keyboard, according to the method of control you have just
     selected.

     To skip the title credits during loading, you may press any key.

     THE GAME CONTROLS

     Throughout this handbook you will see references to a variety of
     "Buttons", such as "Icon Button", "Zoom-In Button", or "Island
     Button". The physical representations of these buttons are detailed
     opposite, along with basic directional controls. More specific
     controls are detailed as necessary throughout the handbook.

     CHAPTER 2 - THE COBRA HEADQUARTERS
     ----------------------------------

     The Head Quarters of the Atlantic Federation Covert Operations BuReAu
     is located on Coral island, nestling in the relative safety of Union
     Bay.
     In front of you are five doors, each clearly signed, behind each of
     which you will find a different department which you may enter. They
     are Personnel, Training, Control, Raids and the War Room. To enter a
     department, move the on-screen pointer over the door. Then, depending
     on your chosen method of control, press either the left mouse button,
     joystick fire button, or keyboard Space Bar. This method of selection
     (by left mouse, fire, or Space Bar) is used to make most choices
     during the game, and is referred to throughout the handbook as the
     "Icon Button".
        As a newly seconded operative, you have a choice as to how you
     learn about being a COBRA special agent. There are three methods of
     discovery, via "Training", "Raids", or "Control". Put simply,
     Training allows you to practise individual skills which you must
     master for success in more complex tasks. Raids will allow you to
     complete one mission in isolation, without reference to the overall
     "Operation Wildfire" Campaign. Control allows you to begin your
     assignments proper, as part of the "Operation Wildfire" Campaign.

     You may select "Training" or "Raids" immediately.

     To see some action as fast as possible, via the "Firefight" route,
     select "Training" and then select the "Firefight" icon which will
     appear. Please go straight to page 30 if this is your choice.
      _
     |_| -> Page 30

                                      -Page 15-

        To perform a mission immediately, you may select "Raids". Please go
     straight to page 35 if this is your choice.
        If you select "Control", to begin playing a Campaign, you will be
     asked to insert your Campaign Disk. Campaign Disks must be prepared in
     the "War Room" before starting a campaign, to avoid the risk of
     permanently altering your original Mission Disk, as the campaign disk
     is updated during each mission. Until you have visited the War Room,
     you can not start a Campaign.
        The Personnel Department will allow you to configure an Agent as you
     wish, and it is important to visit this department before starting a
     Campaign if you want to achieve success. You may perform a Raid without
     visiting the Personnel Department, and to engage in a Firefight, the
     visit is unnecessary.
        Full details of the methods of operation for each department are
     given in the following Chapters; War Room - Chapter 3,
     Personnel - Chapter 4, Training - Chapter 5, Raids - Chapter 6,
     and Control - Chapter 8.

     CHAPTER 3 - THE WAR ROOM
     ------------------------

        On entering the War Room you will be presented with five selectable
     icons; to start a new campaign, to load an existing campaign, to save
     the current campaign, to create back-ups of Program, Graphics, or
     Mission Disks, or to return to the corridor.

     START NEW CAMPAIGN

     Selecting this option will allow you to make a back-up of your original
     "Missions" disk, for use in the game as a "Campaign" disk. It is vital
     that you do this, as the disk will be updated as you perform each
     mission. You cannot start a campaign without creating a "Campaign"
     disk. Have a blank, formatted disk ready. Please ensure that the blank
     disk is write-enabled.
        Type in your personal codename for the Operation. The purpose of
     this codename is to prevent Campaign disks getting mixed up. It is
     impossible to load data for one campaign and accidentally save it to
     the disk for a different campaign. You may also find the codename
     useful for your own reference. We recommend labelling your Campaign
     disk with your chosen codename for the Operation.
        You will receive further on-screen instructions asking youto
     confirm that you intend to 'create a campaign disk'. You may 'abandon
     the operation' at this stage.
        Once youmake your confirmation, youwill be asked to insert your
     Flames of Freedom "Missions" disk (i.e. the original "Missions" disk),
     and then click on the copy icon. Please follow the on-screen prompts
     carefully.

                                      -Page 18-

     Creating a Campaign disk take about five minutes. However, each new
     campaign will give you many hours of enjoyment!

     LOAD EXISTING CAMPAIGN

     To load an existing campaign, select the relevant icon and follow the
     on-screen prompts.

     SAVE CURRENT CAMPAIGN

     To save an existing campaign, select the relevant icon and follow the
     on-screen prompts.

     CREATE BACK-UP DISKS

     You may back-up any of your Flames of Freedom disk by selecting this
     icon and following the on-screen prompts. You will need one blank
     formatted disk for each Flames of Freedom disk you wish to copy.

     EXIT TO CORRIDOR

     When you have finished in the War Room, Select this icon to exit to
     the corridor.

                                      -Page 19-
                                      -Page 20-

     CHAPTER 4 - THE PERSONNEL DEPARTMENT

     The Personnel department allows Special COBRA Agents immediate access
     to their personal records. All choices are made by moving the on-screen
     pointer over the relevant icon and using the "icon selector".
        You may assume any alias, disguise, and characteristics youwish,
     and those of Field Agent Gavin Steel are available for your immediate
     use if youso desire.
        Alternatively you may select an 'agent' from your own recorded
     files, if youhave been here before, or include one for later use.
     (More information on "Personnel Filing" can be found on page 27).
        However, it must be emphasised that the agents during an Operation
     is strictly forbidden.
        Once you begin the "Operation Wildfire" campaign, you undertake to
     play the role of your chosen agent until its completion, and must start
     the entire campaign again if youchoose to change roles.
        It is therefore imperative that yougive thought and consideration
     to your selections when choosing to "Use New Agent". They will now be
     explained to you.

     NAME

     Please enter your forename and surename as youwish them to appear on
     all your records and documentation. Press 'return' after typing each
     name via the keyboard.

                                      -Page 21-

     SEX

     Please indicate your chosen sex by selecting either the male or female
     icon at the bottom of the screen.

     APPEARANCE

                                      -Page 22-

     All Federation Agents have the opportunity to create a facial
     appearance for themselves via the portrait designer. By selecting
     feature combinations via the grey symbols, on the right, the overall
     appearance, shown on the left can take on thousands of different forms.
     There are eight features to combine; face shape, nose, mouth, eyes,
     hair, beard, moustache and glasses.

     Hair, beard and glasses may all be toggled on or off by selecting the
     grey 'circle' icon.

     You may 'scroll' through all the options available for each feature by
     selecting the grey 'plus' (to go forwards) or 'minus' (to go backwards)
     icons.

     Each feature may be positioned on the face by selecting the 'arrow'
     icons. The grey 'up' arrow moves the feature up the face, and the
     'down' arrow moves it down.

     You may experiment with * portrait designer for as long as you like.
     Try creating your own face, or the face you'd like to have, or been
     the one youthink you might have in a few years!
        You can choose to be Black or White. SOme feature options are
     designed for use with Black faces, and others with White faces, but
     ultimately, the choice is yours.
        Once youhave decided on your appearance, select the "Exit" icon at
     the bottom of the screen.

     PSYCHOLOGY

     Every Federation Agent has a slightly different Psychological make-up,
     and you may define yours as youwish, within certain limits. Eight
     psychological traits have been identified;

     SMILING MOUTH - Charm

     MAN / WOMEN SEXSYMBOL - Sex Appeal

     MONEY - Bribery

     KNIFE AGAINST A THROAT - Threats

                                      -Page 23-

     WEIGHT MACHINE (DIDN'T FIND THE RIGHT WORD) - Reason

     EYE WITH A TEAR - Pleading

     HAND WITH POINTING FINGER - Authority

     MOUTH WITH A "TUNG" = Deception

     Each of these traits are rated as 'poor', 'average', 'good' or
     'excellent', and each may be changed by selecting the appropriate
     icon. Ratings are increased by using the left mouse button, or by
     using "<" key on the keyboard if youhave chosen joystick or keyboard
     control. Ratings are decreased by using the right mouse button, or by
     using the ">" key on the keyboard if you have chosen joystick or
     keyboard control.
        Whilst deciding on your psychologocal make-up, bear two things in
     mind; nobody is perfect, and it takes all sorts of people to make a
     world.
        To be successful COBRA Agent takes skill and thought, but, as as
     with everything in life, it involves maximising your strenghts and
     allowing for your weaknesses. Every aspect of your psychological
     make-up will be called upon at one time or another during your work,
     and there will be situations which you can cope with easily, and
     situations which you will find difficult, depending on your chosen
     psychological profile.
        There is a trade-off involved with every change youmake, as being
     highly rated in a certain characteristic (for instance 'pleading'),
     will mean that your rating for another will automatically be lower (in
     this instance 'authority').

     The relationships between characteristics are often complex, but as a
     general guide;

        Charm..................changes...........................Authority
        Sex Appeal.............changes..............................Reason
        Bribery................changes...................Charm / Authority
        Threats................changes.........Charm / Sex Appeal / Reason
        Reason.................changes.................Deception / Bribery
        Pleading...............changes.................Authority / Threats
        Authority..............changes..................Deception / Reason
        Deception..............changes.......Charm / Sex Appeal / Pleading

     The importance of your chosen psychological characteristics will become
     clearer when you

                                      -Page 24-

     read Chapter 14, "Making Contacts and Meeting People" on page 68.
     Broadly speaking, they determine your ability to persuade other
     characters to help you during your missions.
        You can improve by practice. For example, if you use your charm a
     lot, you will become more charming over time. However, this slightly
     decreases your skills in other areas. Improving your charm by constant
     practice will slightly decrease your authority. To make an overall
     improvement you must keep a balance in the approaches you use. If you
     go around behaving like a thug all the time, youwill end up with the
     profile of a thug.
        When you have chosen your psychological profile, select the "Exit"
     icon at the bottom of the screen.

     PHYSIQUE

     Every Federation Agent has a slightly different Physical Profile, and
     you may define yours as you wish, within certain limits. Five physical
     traits have been identified;

     RUNNING MAN - Reflexes

     FOOT IN BANDAGE - Sturdiness

     SWEETING MAN - Endurance

     SLEEPING MAN - Recuperation

     ARM - Stamina

     They too are rated as 'poor', 'average', 'good', or 'excellen', and
     each may be changed by selecting the appropriate icon, using the same
     selection methods used for changing psychological ratings. As with
     the psychological traits, they are interrelated, within the following
     guidelines;

        Reflexes...............changes...........................Endurance
        Sturdiness.............changes.............................Stamina
        Endurance..............changes........................Recuperation
        Recuperation...........changes..........................Sturdiness
        Stamina................changes............................Reflexes

     Your physical profile will govern everything you do as a COBRA agent,
     to a greater or lesser extent, and will alter according to those
     things you do.

                                      -Page 25-

     Reflexes................................governs resistance to injury.
     Sturdiness......................governs rate of recovery from injury.
     Endurance...............governs rate of depletion of energy reserves.
     Recuperation.........governs the amount of energy gained during rest.
     Stamina..............governs how quickly muscle power is replenished.

     Improvements can be made to your physical profile asfollows;

     Reflexes...............are enhanced by being in lots of 'collisions'.
     Sturdiness...................is enhanced by being injured frequently.
     Endurance.........is enhanced by running low on energy for some time.
     Recuperation.....................is enhanced by long periods of rest.
     Stamina..........is improved by periods of energy intensive activity.

     Your physical profile may also take a turn for the worse, as long
     periods of convalescence will reduce Reflexes, Recuperation and
     Stamina, whilst long periods spent held in detention by the enemy
     reduce Sturdiness.
        Improvements or reductions are likely to be gradual, but if
     significant improvement is made, your Physical Profile, may be saved
     on file by visiting the Personnel Department whenever you return to
     Head Quarters.
        Once you have set your Physical Profile as you want it, select the
     "Exit" icon at the bottom-left of the screen.

     STATE OF HEALTH

                                      -Page 26-

     Your overall State of Health at the beginning of your time as a COBRA
     agent will, of course, be perfect.
        On the left-hand side of the screen you can see your created face,
     and on the right, your body. Your body is comprised of six parts which
     may be either 'undamaged' or 'injured'. They are your head,body, left
     arm, right arm, left leg and right leg. If a part becomes injured, it
     will be overlayed by a "Red Cross" symbol. The body parts, or
     combination of parts, which become injured determine which activities
     you will or will not be able to perform. Injured body parts will
     recover during long periods of rest. As a rule, head injuries will heal
     before body injuries, which, in turn, recover quicker than arm injuries.
     Leg injuries take longest to heal. However, if more than one limb is
     injured at any one time, some degree of simultaneous reapir will take
     place.

     There are two factors governing your State of Health;

     a) Energy Reserves, which represents your total stock of energy
     b) Muscle Power, which represents your 'instantaneous' energy

     Energy reserves are shown by the number of 'running man' icons at the
     bottom of the screen. One is shown for each 'full tank' available, and
     initially they number six.
        Muscle Power is shown by the larger 'running man' icon above the
     Energy Reserves. This acts as a 'fuel gauge', the colouring draining
     away as tasks requiring energy are performed.
        When Muscle Power falls to zero, it is replenished automatically
     from your Energy Reserves, BUT thistriggers exhaustion (all actions
     take place at half-speed). To avoid exhaustion you must stop and rest
     before Muscle Power reaches zero. If yourun out of Energy Reserves,
     you will blackout and be forced to stop and rest. After a sustained
     period of rest, during which you will eat and sleep, your Energy
     Reserves will recover. 
        The screen showing your State of Health is for information only, as
     you cannot alter your health whilst in Personnal Department of Head
     Quarters! You may go back to see the choices made for either your
     Physical or Psychological profiles, by selecting the "Heart" or "Head"
     icons respectively.
        Finally, select the "Exit" icon.

     PERSONNEL FILING

     Once you have configured a 'new agent', you will be able to begin life
     in your new role by selecting to 'Use This Agent'. You may want to save
     your records on file before you leave, by opting to 'Include Agent in
     Files'.

     INCLUDE AGENT IN FILES

     Selecting this icon will display two options: to continue saving or to
     abandon your filing.

                                      -Page 27-

     Up to tweleve characters  may be filed on one disk. Simply click on one
     of the empty 'slots', and the agent will be saved. If all the slots are
     full you can write over an existing agent.

     SELECT AGENT FROM FILES

     To 'select an agent from your files', select that icon, and confirm
     that you wish to continue.
        All the agents whose records are held on disk will be shown. Clock
     on the portrait of the agent whose record you wish to load.
        (Please note that the inclusion of an agent on file does not save
     any mission information. Personnel files are saved to allow you to
     restart at any time using the same character. To save the game
     position, enter the War Room and select to "Save Current Campaign").

     Once youhave finished in the Personnel Department, select to "Use
     this Agent" to return to the Main Corridor.

     CHAPTER 5 - TRAINING

     On entering the Training Department, you will be presented with a menu
     from which to choose any one of eight options.

     They are: Strategic Planning, Escape Training, Training on any one of
     the forms off transport across Land, Sea, or Air, Training on
     Amphibious craft, to "Firefight", or to return to the corridor.

     |_| -> 33

     STRATEGY

     Selecting the "Strategy" option allows you to use the strategic
     planning maps placed at your disposal. The strategic planning allows
     youto make a precise simulation of the strategic part of a campaign
     without actually having to engage in any action. You don't want to
     spend hours and hours of play before discovering that you have made
     a monumental strategic blunder.
        This map initially shows the 42 islands, and the coast of Africa,
     colour coded to denote ownership.
        The red island is Agora, controlled by the Atlantic Federation. The
     dark green islands (plus the mainland) are strongholds of the Saharan
     Empire. The light green islands are outposts of the Saharan Empire.
        Areas of the map may be magnified by moving the on-screen pointer
     over the area to be enlarged, and then pressing the "Zoom In button".
     This is the left mouse button, or the "<"

                                      -Page 30-

     key during joystick or keyboard control. After the first magnification
     all island names can be seen.
        To reduce the map once magnified, press the "Zoom Out button". This
     is the right mouse button, or the ">" key during joystick or keyboard
     control. Double presses of Zoom buttons will perform double
     enlargements or reductions.
        The lines joining islands are either light blue or dark blue. These
     show the supply routes for all Slave Islands and, ultimately, every
     island can be traced back, via the supply lines, to the mainland. For
     an outpost to remain under Saharan control, it must at all times be
     able to trace a path via 'active' light blue lines to either a
     stronghold (Lobos, Camargo or Dhafra) or to the mainland.
        Once an island is liberated, it allies itself with the Atlantic
     Federation and it will turn pink. In a real campaign, thishappens
     when yousuccessfully complete a mission. It can be simulated during
     strategic planning by moving the on-screen pointer over an island and
     pressing the "Island button". This is the Space Bar during mouse or
     joystick control and the "return" key during keyboard control. All
     supply routes eminating from the island will turn dark blue, as the
     routes can no longer be used by the Saharan Empire.
        The loss of supply routes when an island is liberated can have a
     domino effect on other islands. For instance, if Lobos is liberated,
     the islands of Panao and Vicenza will also fall of their own accord
     as they cannot trace an active supply route back to a stronghold or
     to the mainland. This means that, in a real campaign, completing one
     mission can lead to the liberation of many islands.
        Use the strategic planning map to simulate the liberation of a
     number of islands and get a feel for the geopolitical importance of an
     island in terms of the overall campaign. To reverse the liberation of
     an island, reselect it using the "Island button".
        At the bottom-left corner of the screen you will see a "Key" icon.
     Moving the pointer over the "Key" will display further icons.

     KEY - Key Icon

     MAN STANDING - Return to Training Menu

     SMALL MAP - Restore Map to original position

     SCORPIO AND A POINTER - Simulate path of Saharan offensive

     Use the "Icon buton" to operate these icons. Use the button elsewhere
     on the map to hide them. Whilst the icons are displayed, zoom in, zoom
     out and island buttons are disabled.
        Selecting the last of these icons will simulate the route of the
     Saharan Armada. The route

                                      -Page 31-

     taken is governed by the following rules;

        1) The route must always avoid liberated islands if possible.

        2) When it is impossible for the Armada to reach Agora without
           by-passing liberated islands, the Armada must attack and re-take
           liberated islands in its path. It always seeks to make as few
           such attacks as possible.

        3) When there is more than one unopposed route, the Armada will
           choose the shortest.

        4) If there is an equal choice between a stronghold and an outpost,
           the route will go via the stronghold.

     To summarise, the Armada takes the easiest, shortest route. The
     strategic planning gives a totally accurate simulation of the route
     the Armada would take if those islands had been liberated in the
     campaign itself.
        The Armada consists of Air fleets, Amphibious fleets and Surface
     fleets. When a Surface fleet reaches the coast of a liberated island,
     it pauses to disembark a Land Army. The Land army moves inland to
     retake the island, before making a rendezvous with the Surface fleet
     further round the coast. If either the Surface fleet, or its Land
     army are destroyed before the rendezvous, neither can proceed any
     further.
        When a fleet or an army is destroyed, it disappears from the map.
     Matching what happens in a realcampaign, Saharan units suffer
     attrition due to the action of Federation forces. Attrition is light
     in the neighbourhood of Saharan islands, but heavy when the Armada
     has to retake liberated islands. Such attrition is independent of
     your own personal actions. Your task in the campaign is to cause
     additional damage.
        In thisstrategic simulation, some elite elements of the Armada
     will always reach Agora, no matter how tortuous the route. The number
     of Saharan units reaching their ultimate target gives an indication
     of the difficulty of your personal battle against the Armada. In the
     campaign itself, no units must reach their targets on Agora.
        Once the Armada has completed its path, select the "Restore Map"
     icon to try a different configuration, or reselect the "Launch Armada"
     icon to clear them from the map.
        To quit Strategic Planning and return to the Training Menu, select
     the "Waiting Man" icon. 

     ESCAPE TRAINING

     Should the unthinkable happen, namely your capture by the Saharan
     Empire's Secret Police

                                      -Page 32-

     whilst operating in the field, your Escape Training could prove to be
     a lifeline.
        You have the opportunity to practice your response to a number of
     Secret Police Guards who watch over you as you languish in your cell.
     Your aim is to escape by means of a bribe, aggressive behaviour, or
     seduction. Alternatively, youmay bide your time and wait for more
     susceptible guard.
        Knowing your own psychological profile and guessing, that of your
     guard are the keys to success. The simulator offers you the chance to
     learn the likely responses of a number of Saharan guards before facing
     them for real on your missions. Each guard has his own particular
     susceptibilities, and will react predictably to bribery, aggression or
     seduction, given your own rating for bribery, threats and sex appeal.
     However, on one day in seven, each guard has an "off day", and does
     the opposite of what youwould expect.
        The guards you encounter in Training will also be encountered
     during a real mission, and will react in the same way.
        Full information on escaping capture is to be found in Chapter 15,
     starting on page 75. You should read thisbefore using the Escape
     Training simulator.
        The only way to return to the main Training menu is to escape from
     capture. Good Luck!

     TRANSPORT TRAINING

     By selecting the 'Land', 'Sea', 'Air', or 'Amphibious' icons, you may
     call up sub-menus which list the forms of transport in each category.
     By selecting an icon from the sub-menus you can practice using that
     form of transport.
        To return to the main menu from a sub-menu, select the "Chalkboard"
     icon, and to return to the corridor select the "Corridor" icon.
        Full information on Transport is to be found in Chapter 9, starting
     on page 45. You should read this before using the Transport Training
     simulator.
        Whilst using the Transport Training simulator you will not come
     under attack from enemy units, giving you ample opportunity to master
     the controls for each mode of transport. Transport training takes place
     on the island of Agora. You may travel to other islands during
     transport training, but they will appear barren and empty.
        To return from any individual form of transport training to the
     training menu, press Function Key F10 on the keyboard.

     FIREFIGHT

     The Firefight option offers puts you into the thick of the action
     through a mission.
        You will find yourself in a Flying Sub, in the middle of a battle
     with an enemy unit. You can manouevre your vehicle and fire your
     weapons. As well as that you can try out every aspect if the Firefight
     mission, including talking to people, persuading them to help, getting

                                      -Page 33-

     captured, destroying buildings, achieving mission objectives, even
     completing the whole mission.

     FIREFIGHT FLYING START

     Your Flying Sub can travelthrough the air, across land and underwaters,
     and is the most versatile vehicle in the game. The "Help" key will
     always show you the main controls for every vehicle you use. Please

     Having investigated the functioning of the Training Department, you
     will have seen how it is possible to practice elements of the game in
     isolation, be they driving, flying, escaping, or fighting.
        But no matter how much youpractice individual skills at HQ, there's
     no substitute for learning by experience in the field. No matter how
     good an agent youfeel yourself to be, you are never too good to learn
     more.
        In Flames of Freedom you have a choice as to which style of game you
     wish to play. If you select a "Raid" game, you can tackle any of 41
     action packed missions. Each mission can be completed in one playing
     session. They are graded according to difficulty. Some can be finnished
     in as little as half an hour. Some may take a lot longer. Every single
     one is a complete game in itself.
        If you select a "Campaign" game, youhave to complete a number of
     the individual missions and then, in the final stages of the Campaign,
     youmust defeat the massively powerful Saharan Armada which sets sail
     from the coast of Africa. The route that the Armada will take depends
     entirely on which island you have liberated in the course of your
     missions. In addition, each liberated island, contributes forces to the
     counter-attack on the Armada.
        A Campaign game offers you a stupendous challeneg packed with
     variety. As well as all the action and tactics of the missions, your
     overall strategy is vital in defeating the Armada. A Campaign game will
     keep youon the edge of your seat through many sessions of play. A
     Campaign victory is a victory indeed.
        To play a Raid game, select the "Raids" door in the HQ corridor. To
     play a Campaign, select the "Control" door.


     On entering the "Raids" Department youwill be asked to select a
     difficulty level, from Novice, through Intermediate and Experienced, to
     Expert. The difficulty level governs how many Secret Weapons you start
     off with, ranging from a lot for a Novice through to none for an
     Expert.
     Once you have selected a difficulty level, you will be asked to choose
     a mission. The processes for mission selection are identical whether
     they are performed as a Raid or as part of a Campaign, and are covered
     in Chapter 8 - Mission Briefings, starting on page 39.

                                      -Page 36-
                                      -Page 37-

        Each of the forty-one missions are very different in objective,
     content and effect on the campaign. Before each mission you will be
     comprehensively briefed on your mission objectives, transport
     available, weapons available, known contacts, political background of
     the island, and generally given all available Federation intelligence.
        What you will not be told is the range of options open to youas a
     Field Agent, the adventures you are likely to experience, and the
     incredible diversity of situations you will encounter. For that the
     Federation relies on your intelligence, skill and ambition. That is
     why youwere recruited. That is why youare the one being sent on the
     mission.
        Having said that, it is only fair that youare given a general
     overview of the elements which comprise most missions and the means
     by which you can complete them.
        The ultimate aim of every mission is to liberate the island. At the
     beginning of each mission you are given an islandreport, outlining in
     brief the background of the island, the major objectives, and any
     relevant details. For example, you are told that the island of Khash
     houses the Imperial Treasury, and your major objective is to deprive
     the Enemy of its primary source of revenue. In pursuit of that overall
     goal, and to achieve success, youmust complete a number of very
     specific objectives, given to you during the mission briefing.
          You arrive on or near the island with a particular type of
     vehicle, or on foot. That mode of transport may be swapped for any
     other you find on your travels, and youmay keep leaping from vehicle
     to vehicle as and when youfind them. In fact, for most missions, more
     than one type of vehicle is needed to accomplish your objectives.
     Chapter 9 - Transport - start on page 45, and gives a general insight
     into moving around the islands, seas and skies above them.
        You are given weapons to use on the island, but additional weapons
     may be carried and used once youhave found them. You will need to find
     additional weapons in order to be successful. Appendix B - Weapons
     Systems - starts on page 135, and gives detailed information on the
     range of weapons which may be found.
        You will be given the names and locations of any known contacts on
     the island, but these people comprise only a small fraction of the
     people you will see, meet and talk to. Contacts themseleves will often
     refer you on to other people likely to help. As a word of warning,
     whilst every attempt is made to provide youwith contacts who are
     reliable and thrustworthy, youshould be wary of everyone youmeet.
     However some of the people you will meet will offer extremely valuable
     help. Chapter 14 - Meeting People - starts on page 68, and covers
     every aspect of human interaction.
        Encountering vehicles, weapons and people will demand an immediate
     response from you. The Chapter on Special Actions, starting on page 52,
     covers such events.
        Where you travel on the island is up to you. You are provided with
     comprehensive maps of the island which youmust learn to read and use
     to the maximum benefit. The Chapter on Map Reading starts on page 60.
        You will always need to keep a check on your personal state of
     health, and will from time to time need to take rest and recuperation.
     Chapter 17 - Self - and Chapter 18, Rest, deal with these.
        Keeping track of what you've done and what youhave learnt will be
     vital, and you will carry a personal notebook for this purpose. It is
     updated automatically when significant events occur. Chapter 16 - Your
     Notebook - will help youget the best from it.
        There is a danger that youmay fall victim to the Saharan Empire's
     secret police. In the event of such a situation arising, Chapter 15 -
     Escaping from Capture - will prove vital reading.
        You will be under constant threat of attack from Saharan forces, and
     youyourself will want to surprise enemy troops. Chapter 11 - Engaging
     the Enemy - indicates the best lines of approach.
        The sequence of events after a mission's completion can be found in
     Chapter 19, Acheiving your Mission Objectives, on page 88.
        Eventually, the Saharan Armada will launch its attack aimed at
     capturing Agora. The actions expected of youonce thissituation
     arises are explained in Chapter 20, The Armada, on page 90.

                                      -Page 38-

     CHAPTER 8 - MISSION BRIEFING

     SELECTING A MISSION

     Once youhave decided to attempt any mission as a Raid, by selecting
     the "Raids" door and then specifying your chosen difficulty level, or
     as part of the overall Campaign, be selecting the "Control" door, you
     will greeted by Control himself, the Director General of COBRA, and be
     asked to select which island you are going to perform a mission on.

     As youmove the on-screen pointer over the islands, you will notice
     that one or more "Skull" symbols appears in the top left-hand corner
     above Agora. The Skull Ratings indicate the difficulty of a mission.
     "Five-Skull" missions are the hardest, with "One-Skull" missions being
     the easiest.
        The Map may be magnified ny using the "Zoom In button", and then
     reduced by using the "Zoom Out button". Once the map is magnified once,
     all island names can be seen. Icons can be seen in the bottom right
     hand corner;

     ISLANDS WITH LINES BETWEEN

     Allows you to go to Strategic Planning, as explained earlier on page
     30. Accessed at this stage, Strategic Planning takes as its starting
     point the islands currently liberated in your Campaign. (The Strategic
     Planning option will not appear if youare performing the missionas
     a Raid)

                                      -Page 40-

     MAN STANDING - Returns youto the corridor.

     Once youhave decided which missionyouwould like to go on, move the
     pointer over that island and press the "Island button". Please follow
     any on-screen disk prompts.

     MISSION BRIEFING SCREENS

     The island report will be loaded and displayed. This outlines in brief
     the background of the island, the major objectives, and any relevant
     details. This is the first section of your missionbriefing.
        There are seven sections in all. You can step through them is
     sequence by using the "Turn Page" icons. Alternatively, youcan look
     at each section individually using the "Question Mark" icon.
        When you select the Question Mark icon, Control will appear to brief
     you on your mission. There are seven aspects of the mission about which
     you may question him. These are represented by the seven icons across
     the bottom of the screen. In the upper right-hand corner are icons to
     accept ("thumbs up") or reject ("thumbs down") the mission.
        The seven areas of information are, reading the icons from left to
     right, Island Report,

                                      -Page 41-

     Mission Objectives, Journey Time to Mission Island, Supplied Transport,
     Supplied Weapons System(s), Contacts, and General Intelligence.
        Each area of information can be obtained by moving the on-screen
     pointer over the relevant icon and pressing the Icon Selector.

     ICON:

     An island - Displays the island report.

     A house   - Mission Objectives. Each missioncomprises a number of
                 objectives, all of which must be completed to achieve
                 success. Each objective will appear in turn. The numbering
                 of the objectives does not indicate an order of priority.
                 It is not necessary to commit your objectives to memory, as
                 you will be able to review them throughout the mission.

     Island & running man - journey to island. This display the route and
                            time you will take in travelling to the island.

     Ship, sub - Transport supplied. Your transport on arrival on the island
                 is shown.

     Gun & ammo - Weapon(s) supplied. The weapon(s) which youwill start the
                  mission with are shown.

     Man - Contacts. This displays the names and portraits of those people
           on the island knowm to be willing to help.

     Book - Island Intelligence. Finally, yousee a summary of the
            Intelligence gathered on the island thus far. The islandmap is
            shown, overlayed by a number of coloured roundels. The map
            cannot be magnified.

                                      -Page 42-

     Immediately below each roundel is a red point, indicating the exact
     position of the feature represented by the roundel. By moving the
     on-screen pointer over thispoint, the exact nature of the feature can
     be seen. Even if a point is hidden, moving the pointer over its
     position will bring that roundel to the fore. The roundels comprise
     one of six basic types.

     ROUNDELS:

     body - Indicates the known position of a person.

     Scorpio - Indicates the position of an enemy unit.

     Gun - Indicates the position of spare weapons and ammunition.

     Truck - Indicates the position of spare land vehicles.

     Plane - Indicates the position of spare air vehicles.

     Boat - Indicates the position of spare sea vehicles.

                                      -Page 43-

     Where the location of a feature co-incides with a named town or
     village, the name of the place will be shown above a description of
     the feature. The feature will be described in one of the following
     ways.

        People : Their names are given

        Enemy Units : Each unit has a Commander, whose name is given, and
                      the number and type of vehicles he commands will be
                      detailed.

        Spare Vehicles : The type of vehicle is shown.

        Spare Weapons : The type of weapon is shown.

     At some points, one or more features may coincident. In such cases,
     each coincident feature will be given an item number. The features will
     be automatically stepped through on screen.
        Known villages are represented on the map by blue dots. Moving the
     pointer over the dot will display the name.
        All information known to the Federation before the commencement of
     your mission is shown on the intelligence map, but on some islands this
     may be limited. Whenever youcome across a feature on your travels, it
     will automatically be registered on the intelligence screen.

     ACCEPTING THE MISSION

     Finally, you must accept or reject the missionby selecting either the
     "thumbs-up" (to accept) or the "thumbs-down" (to reject) icon in the
     upper right-hand corner of the briefing screen. If youreject the
     missionyou return to the MissionSelection map.
        If you accept the mission you will be given a message of luck by
     Control before making your journey to the island. The next time you
     return to Head Quarters will, hopefully, be after the successful
     completion of your mission.
        It is time for your Fieldcraft to be put to the test.

     CHAPTER 9 - TRANSPORT AND MOVEMENT

     TRANSPORT TYPES

     There are 22 different types of transport which youmay utilise during
     your missions, and they are divided into four categories; Land, Sea,
     Air and Amphibious.

         LAND               SEA               AIR               AMPHIBIOUS

        Bus...............Frogman............Ballon............Flying Boat
        Jeep..............Swimming...........Biplane............Flying Sub
        On Foot............Minisub...........Helicopter.........Hovercraft
        Tank................Ship.............Parachute.............Crawler
        Train.............Speedboat..........Rocket Pack
        Truck.............Submarine..........Zeppelin

     Each mode of transport has its own characteristics, benefits and
     drawbacks, whichare all fully documented in Appendix D, Transport
     Types, on page 145.
        The specific controls for each mode of transport are also documented
     there, along with other vital statistics such as top speed and range.
     Whilst using any form of transport, pressing the "Help" key will
     display its controls. Press the Help key again to resume the action.
        Any mode of transport may be practised brefore leaving Agora, via
     the Training Department (see page 29 for more information), and you
     may find this facility useful both before and between missions.

     TRANSFERRING BETWEEN TRANSPORT MODES

     You will always be provided with a mode of transport with which to start
     your mission, but youwill probably need to use several modes in
     achieving the sucessful completion of a mission. Transfer between
     vehicles is simple. Whenever yousee a vehicle ahead ofhas a 'human' mode of movement associated with it. To
     transfer from your current vehicle to the human mode, simply press
     "ESC" key on the keyboard. The human modes are On Foot, Parachute,
     Swimming, or Frogman, depending on the area of the landscape in which
     youare travelling. These methods of movement are especially useful if
     youwish to explore restricted areas of the landscape, such as
     buildings or underwater bases, and to use certain weapons you must be
     in human mode (for example, planting dynamite).

                                      -Page 46-

     THE VIEWS

     Each mode of transport allows youto see your surroundings directly
     ahead of you. In some modes, such as "On Foot" and "Swimming", yousee
     only your surroundings. Most modes show part of the vehicle as well.
     For instance, when in a jepp, youwill be able to see through the
     windscreen. In some, such as a Biplane, you can see more of your
     vehicle. In thisexample, the nose section ahead of youand the wings
     to either side.

     THE 3-D LANDSCAPE

     In every mode, the full effect of the stunning 3-D landscape and its
     components allow youto identify varying terrain, people, buildings,
     and other vehicles at a glance. Every type of building and vehicle can
     be found in the relevant Appendix at the end of the handbook, which is
     useful for identification purposes.
        Each element of the landscape may be crossed in certain modes of
     transport, as shown in the table at the start of thisChapter. Whilst
     on land youhave full freedom of movement in all 360o around you,
     unless your path is blocked by a solid object. If youare in a mode of
     transport which allows you to fly, you may also take off. While in the
     air, youmay move in any direction up to a ceiling of 12000 feet above
     sea level. Sea surface vessels are restricted in a similar way to land
     surface vehicles (unless the vehicle has aerial or underwater
     capabilities as well). Sub-aquatic modes of transport are restricted
     by the solid sea bed below them; all but the Crawler can break the
     surface and travel across the sea. Certain vehicle types allow youto
     "loop-the-loop", both in the air and underwater, provided that you
     have enough clearance above the ground or sea-bed.
        When crossing in a vehicle from land to sea, or vice versa, take
     care. If youcross whilst in a human mode (i.e. On Foot, Swimming, as
     a Frogman or whilst Parachuting), youwill automatically switch from
     one human mode to another. If youcross in an Amphibious mode of
     transport, your journey may continue uninterupted. If youdrive into
     sea in a land vehicle, or drive onto the land in a sea vehicle, you
     will find yourself stranded! Usually it's possible to get out of
     difficulties by waiting for the next wave and going into reverse.
     Sometimes, however, you'll find yourself well and truly stuck. Then
     you'll simply have to abandon your vehicle.

     THE TRANSPORT CONTROL PANEL

     In order to make the control of every mode of transport easy to learn,
     there is a standardised instrument display which will appear at the top
     of the screen.

     See overleaf

     MUSCLE POWER INDICATOR

     The Muscle Power Indicator shows how quickly youare using up energy.
     Each Emptying of the indicator uses up one tankful of your Energy
     Reserves.
        When the indicator is red and white, you are tireless and all your
     actions take place at normal speed. When the indicator is grey, you
     are exhausted and all your actions take place at half-speed (you will
     notice the game clock ticking over twice as fast as normal).
        Exhaustion is overcome by stopping to rest for a few minutes. Your
     Muscle Power is then refreshed from your Energy Reserves. Resting for
     an hour or more will automatically replenish your Energy Reserves as
     well. If yourun out of Energy Reserves, youwill blackout and be
     forced to stop and rest.

     TIME CLOCK

     The 24 hour clock shows the time of day. Each day is divided into
     periods of daylight and darkness, with sunrise starting at 0600 hrs,
     and sunset at 1800 hrs, as you are near the Equator.
        Periods of darkness offer youthe opportunity to carry out
     manouevres whilst the enemy are in a reduced state of alert. However,
     you will find it more difficult to move around yourself. You are
     equipped with a pair of Infra-Red Goggles which may be turned on and
     off by pressoing the "I" key on the keyboard. When they are active,
     your night-time vision is improved. They will stay on for a period of
     up to an hour (game time), when fully charged. As soon as youswitch
     them off or they run out of power they will start to recharge. It is
     recommended that youswitch them off as soon as possible to keep them
     fully charged for emergencies. If the batteries are below quarter
     power, you will not be able to switch them on.

                                      -Page 49-

     Firing ogg flares (if you have them) will also light up the landscape
     for a short while.

     THE MINI-MAP

     The mini-map covers an area corresponding to the main map at full zoom
     (centered on your position), and shows the relief map of your
     surroundings, enabling you to identify hills and slopes, ocean trenches
     and shallows, and the coastline. The read arrow indicates both your
     position and direction.

     THE COMPASS

     The compass indicates the direction in which you are currently heading.

     SPEEDOMETER

     Showing your velocity in both figures and as a bar. Velocity may be
     positive (red) when going forward, or negative (green) when going
     backwards.

     TURN INDICATOR

     The turn indicator shows both direction and rate of turn. The harder
     you turn, the longer the arrow becomes.

     ARTIFICIAL HORIZON

     The green line represents the position and angle of the horizon
     relative to your vehicle, and may be used to estimate your tilt and
     roll.

     FUEL GAUGE

     Your fuel gauge shows the amount of fuel left in the vehicle(where
     appropriate).

     ALTIMETER

     The Altimeter shows your height above the ground or depth below the
     sea level, in feet. When above the ground, values appear in green,
     and when below sea level, values appear in blue.

     WEAPONS SYSTEM SELECTED

     The window shows the current weapon selected, and gives in figures the
     ammunition remaining. To select another weapon, press the "+" (plus),
     or "-" (minus) keys on the main keyboard. The window will show each
     weapon in turn if youcontinue to press + or -. The weapon shown in
     the window is the one you are currently using, and the one which will
     fire when youpress the "Fire button" (Space Bar during Keyboard or
     Mouse control, Fire button during joystick control). For information
     on using each weapon, please see page 135.

     SPECIAL ACTIONS

     The short range radar window is also used as a "Special Actions"
     window. There are three possible Special Actions. You can Talk to a
     person, Leap into another vehicle, or grab a weapon out of a weapons
     box. Whenever youcome close enough to a person, vehicle, or box, one
     of the three Special Actions icons will appear in thiswindow. Hitting
     the Special Actions key (F1) will then trigger that particular action.
     Further information is given in the next Chapter, "Special Actions".

     MESSAGES

     Occassionally, a message may appear across the main display giving you
     important extra information about special situations.

     CHAPTER 10 - SPECIAL ACTIONS

     As a top Field Operative, the Atlantic Federation depend on youfor
     your quick wits and reflexes. Your missioninvolves hundreds of
     decisions, each of which must be taken by you alone. The Federation
     have given youone mode of transport, and maybe a couple of weapons.
     They've also given youa few names and faces to look out for.
        Unless you get hold of other vehicles, weapons and people, you're
     not likely to succeed.
        To make the execution of all these essential actions quick and easy,
     your instrumentation panel contains a "Special Actions" window, which
     is shared with the short range radar.
        When you are close enough to another vehicle to "leap" into it, or
     close enough to a person to "talk" to them, or close enough to an
     object to "grab" it, one of the following icons will appear in the
     window;

     RUNNING MAN - Leap

     A HANDSHAKE - Talk

     A HAND AND A CUBE - Grab

     To execute the action, press Function Key F1 on the keyboard. So long
     as the action is stil possible, the icon will remain. When youmove out
     of range of the vehicle, person or object, the icon will disappear.

     LEAPING INTO VEHICLES

     Once you"leap" from one mode of transport to another, an intermediate
     screen will appear while youjump. The landscape will then reappear,
     viewed from your new vehicle. The method of control for your new
     vehicle will probably differ from that of your previous transport
     mode. Consult the control data on your new mode in Appendix D if
     necessary.

     TALKING TO PEOPLE

     Once you"talk" to someone, his or her portrait will appear, along with
     some information about them. You may, at this stage, change your mind
     about talking to them by selecting the "Exit" icon. Please refer to the
     Chapter "Making Contacts and Meeting People" on page 68, for full
     details of how to talk to them.

                                      -Page 53-

     GRABBING OBJECTS

     All the objects youcan grab are stored in Weapons Boxes. The contents
     of a Weapons Box can only be discovered by "grabbing". Once you"grab"
     an object, its picture will appear, along with some information about
     it. It will usually be a weapon, but it might be some vital documents
     or even a deadly booby trap. If it is a weapon or papers, youwill
     automatically collect them and add them to your resources. Simply wait
     a few seconds to return to the 3-D environment. If it is a booby trap,
     youwill be told how long youhave to get away from it before it
     explode. If youdo not make it, youwill be hurt, so get moving!

     CHAPTER 11 - ENGAGING THE ENEMY

     Engaging enemy forces during a mission is inevitable, no matter how
     much youaim to void them. Enemy forces are divided into units,
     according to the transport mode used by them. Each unit has a
     Commander, and the size of units can vary from a few vehicles to
     dozens.

     YOUR FIREPOWER

     Each vehicletype is vulnerable to attack with certain weapons. Some
     weapons are highly specialised, being effective only in certain area
     of the landscape or against certain vehicles. Others have more general
     capabilities and may be used against a wide range of targets. The
     table at the end of thischapter shows each weapon's effectiveness
     against each vehicle type. It can also be found in Appendix B,
     Weapons Systems, which gives a fuller account of each weapon's
     general characteristics.

     ENEMY TACTICS

     The enemy vehicles youencounter during your missions all use the
     same sort of tactics against you. If youunderstand the enemy's
     tactical procedures, youwill have a distinct advantage in battle
     (or in avoiding it).

     TACTICAL STATUS

     The tactical status of each enemy vehiclechanges as it picks up
     signals of your activity, proceeding through 5 different phases:-

     IDLE      The vehicleremains stationary, watching for any sign of
               your activity.

     ALERT     The vehiclemakes intermittent movement, looking for further
               signs of your activity.

     SEARCH    The vehiclemoves at speed on a search pattern, looking for
               strong signals of your position and movement.

     ATTACK    The vehiclemoves directly towards youon an attack run.

     EVADE     The vehiclebreaks off its attack run and veers away from
               you, before makinga fresh attack.

                                      -Page 56-

     DETECTION FOOTPRINTS

     A detection foorprint corresponds to the zone in which you are
     "visible" to the enemy vehicle.
        The actual size and shape of the footprints are different for each
     type of vehicle and there are different footprints for activation
     (signs of your activity), tracking (signals of your position and
     movement), lock-on (accurate tracking for weapons systems) and evade
     (range of approach).
        The activation, tracking and lock-on footprints are directional
     footprints with a longer zone of detection ahead of the vehicle than
     behind it.

     FIRING WEAPONS

     An enemy vehicle will fire at you both in the ATTACK pahse and the
     EVADE phase. Before firing, the vehiclemust pick up a continuous
     burst of lock-on signals.

     TIME-OUTS

     The enemy vehiclewill only remain in the higher phases of tactical
     status for a certain amount of time before giving up the search and
     dropping down to a lower, less active phase. This is a time-out.
     The length of time before a time-out varies according to the type
     of vehicle and tactical status.

                                      -Page 57-

     HINTS AND TIPS ON ENEMY TACTICS

     There is no substitute for actual battle experience, but knowing how
     the enemy tactics work gives youa framework to relate your experience
     to.
        The time-outs and detection footprints for each type of enemy
     vehicle are something youmust discover for yourself during battle.
     However, there are some particular things worth mentioning.

     1) Biplanes, Flying Boats & Flying Subs

     The tactical status of these three types of unit never falls below
     search. If youfind a stationary biplane, for instance, it will
     always be a spare vehicleand NOT a part of an enemy unit.

     2) Sneaking Up

     Because the enemy vehicles look further ahead than behind, it's
     possible to sneak up on certain types of enemy vehicle from behind.
     With a tank, for instance, youshould be able to get within grenade
     range before youare spotted.

     3) Rapid Manouevres

     Rapid and violent manouevres on your part can prevent the enemy
     vehiclefrom getting a continuous lock-on signal and thus prevent it
     from firing on you. To succeed in this, you must get out of its,
     forward-looking lock-on "beam". Heading directly away from the vehicle
     will only do thisif youcan out-run it very quickly! Heading away at
     right angles is much more likely to succeed.

     4) Consistency

     Enemy vehiclecommanders go through a rigid training system and
     consequently react very predictably. Learn how one tank behaves and
     you've learnt how all the other tanks will behave.

     WEAPON EFFECTIVENESS

     The table below shows the probability of a player using a particular
     weapon, "killing" a particular vehicle with a hit. Figures are all
     given as percentages, with a figure of 100% indicating that a hit
     with that weapon will always destroy that vehicle.

     CHAPTER 12 - MAP READING

     Whilst in the Atlantic Federation Headquarters, youwill see the
     Political Map, allowing you to perform your Strategic Planning and
     Mission Selection. The Political Map shows each island in outline,
     coloured to indicate whether it is under Federation or Saharan control,
     with supply lines between islands shown as active or broken. Full
     information can be found on page 30.
        During mission briefing, the intelligence map shows the selected
     island in relief form, overlayed by roundels indicating the location
     of people, vehicles, weapons and enemy units. Full information can be
     found on page 43.
        Once youstart your mission, you are given access to a high detail
     relief map of the whole East Atlantic, showing all 42 islands and part
     of the African mainland. This can be accessed at any time during your
     mission by pressing Function Key F5.
        The map will first appear focused on the mission island. It can be
     magnified and reduced at will. To magnify, move the pointer to the
     centre of the area you want to enlarge, end then press the "Zoom in
     button". To reduce, simply press the "Zoom out button". Double presses
     of "Zoom buttons" cause double enlargements or reductions. The map can
     be reduced or magnified whilst in any map display mode (see below).
        Your position is shown by the red dor below the white "running man".
     The red lines on the map show roadways, the blue lines show railways,
     and the white lines show shipping routes.
        In the lower left-hand corner youwill see a "Key". Moving the
     pointer over thisicon will 'open' the map key icons, displaying them
     along the bottom of the screen.

     The icons which appear are;

     MAN - Exit.
           Reverts back to the screen from which youaccessed the map.

     MOUNTAINS - Isometric.
                 Changes the view from overhead to isometric.

     MOUNTAINS FROM ABOVE - Overhead.
                            Changes the view from isometric to overhead.

     Each icon represents an option which may be selected by moving the
     pointer over the icon and pressing the "Icon button". Notice that
     once the key is opened, the circle around the pointer disappears. If
     the circle is present, the pointer can 'pick-up' map features as it
     moves over them. When the map key is open, it can't. To 'close' the
     map key, click anywhere on

     the map once. You must also close the key before magnification or
     reduction.
        As youmay see, the icons are each one of a pair, one to activate an
     option, and one to deactivate it. In addition, settlement information
     can not be shown unless the settlements are themselves being shown.
        Isometric views and sea bed relief views gives youa better
     indication of the changing terrain of an island and the surrounding
     ocean than that offered by the top-down view. Settlements, roads and
     railways are not shown on the isometric view.
        The political map shows the colour-coded ownership of the islands
     and supply lines between them. It can display settlements and
     intelligence data, if those options are turned on.
        Settlement locations are shown as blue dots (when the option to show
     them has been activated). By moving the pointer over the blue dots you
     can display their names. (Before doing this, make sure that the map key
     is closed). If youactivate the "settlement information window" option,
     the buildings types found in each settlement will also be shown.
     Buildings which have been destroyed are listed in red. More information
     of building types can be found in Appendix E, starting on page 152.
        By turning the intelligence data option on, the positions of people,
     enemy units, spare vehicles and spare weapons are mapped. Only items
     youhave knowledge of are displayed. They are all marked with coloured
     roundels. Some of the roundels may overlap, but even those partially or
     totally hidden at first can be seen and identified.
        Immediately below each roundel is a red dot, indicating the exact
     position of the item represented by the roundel. By moving the
     on-screen pointer over thisdot, full details of the item can be
     displayed. Even if a dot is hidden, moving the pointer over its
     position will bring its roundel to the fore. The roundels comprise
     one of six basic types.

     body - Indicates the known position of a person.

     Scorpio - Indicates the position of an enemy unit.

     Gun - Indicates the position of a spare weapon.

     Truck - Indicates the position of spare land transport.

                                      -Page 63-

     Plane - Indicates the position of spare air vehicles.

     Boat - Indicates the position of spare sea vehicles.

     Hovercraft - Indicates the position of space amphibious transport.

     Where the location of an item coincides with a named town or village,
     the name of the place will be shown above a description of the item,
     provided that the settlement location icon has been previously
     selected. The item may be described by one of the following ways.

     People: Their names are given

     Enemy Units: Each unit has a Commander, whose name and rank is given,
                  together with type and number of vehicles in his unit.

     Spare Vehicles: The type of vehicleis given.

     Spare Weapons: The type of weapon is given.

     At some locations, one or more items may occur simultaneously. In such
     cases, each coincident item will be given an item number. The items
     will be automatically stepped through on screen, so long as the
     pointer remains over them.
        Whenever youcome across an item on your travels it will
     automatically be registered. Weapons, vehicles, people and enemy units
     register as intelligence data. On rare occasions, youmay discover an
     unknown building or settlement, but the vast majority of settlements
     are known about before youstart the mission.
        Autoroute and its accompanying features are all explained in the
     following Chapter.
        As the Map becomes filled, you may find it easier to read when only
     one type of roundels at a time is displayed. This can be done by
     pressing number keys 1 to 5 on the keyboard which have the following
     effect;

     1. Displays all knowledge.
     2. Displays Enemy Unit knowledge.
     3. Displays Spare Weapons knowledge.
     4. Displays Spare Vehicle knowledge.
     5. Displays Peoples knowledge.

     CHAPTER 13 - AUTOROUTE & QUICK TIME

     The Autoroute facility allows you to map out journeys youwish to make,
     and then execute them with "hands-free" control, watching the passing
     landscapes, until it becomes necessary for youto take direct control
     of the vehicleagain. Quick Time similarly allows you predetermined
     movement from A to B, but differs from Autoroute in that your route is
     displayed on the map of the island rather than by travelling through
     the actual landscape.
        Quick Time allows youto skip the drudgery of long, uneventful
     journeys, but the game clock still ticks on. It is quick for you
     personally, but not necessarily for your hero!

     SETTING YOUR ROUTE

     Autoroutes are set via the map, at any magnification or view. However,
     they are best set at a magnification which gives you sufficient detail
     of the area youwish to cross. You must use the overhead view. To
     display the map, press Function Key F5. Once it is displayed, and you
     have selected the magnification and view which yourequire, open the
     map key by moving the pointer over the key icon. Select the "Set
     Autoroute" icon. The key will close, and a circle will appear around
     the tip of the pointer.
        In setting an autoroute, you must plot the path you wish to follow
     on the map. This path need not be in a straight line, but, in order to
     "curve" or change direction, a "waymarker" must be plotted. Waymarkers
     are plotted by moving the pointer to the desired location on the map,
     and then pressing the Space Bar. Once the first waymarker has been
     plotted, a red line will link your current position (shown by the
     white "running man") to the waymarker. As subsequent markers are
     plotted, the red line will continue to link them, showing the route
     you will take. Up to 100 marker may be plotted along one route.
        Once you have started to plot an Autoroute, the "Cancel Autoroute"
     icon will appear in the key. Select thisicon if youmake a mistake
     in plotting, or change your mind about plotting an Autoroute.
        Autoroutes may be set which cross the seas to another island. If
     youwish to do this, or if youwish to cross land not shown at the
     current magnification, select a lower magnification which shows
     sufficient area of the map to allow the plotting of the whole route.
     However, if youintend to jorney across land then sea, or vice-versa,
     it is wise to be travelling in a mode of airborne or amphibious
     transport, otherwise your journey may be rudely interrupted!
        Once you have set the autoroute, select the "Exit" icon from the key.
     You will be returned to the mode of transport which youwere last using,
     travelling along your chosen route at about three-quarters of the
     transport mode's top speed. The Radar Map/Special Actions window of the
     instrumentation display will read "Autoroute". To take direct control of
     the transport again, press "Autoroute Off" (Function Key F3). The word
     "Autoroute" will disappear, and you will once again have direct control
     of your vehicle.
        Using Autoroute demands that you keep your eyes open and your wits
     about you. You may still crash into any object (such as trees,
     buildings, people or enemy units), you may still

                                      -Page 66-

     be fired upon, and you may, if you have set an autoroute which crosses
     from land to sea or vice-versa, crash as youcross the coastline, if
     your vehicle is not amphibious or airborne.
        You can select Quick Time at any moment during an Autoroute journey,
     by pressing the "Quick Time" key (Function Key F4) whilst youare
     travelling through the landscape. Alternatively, having plotted your
     route on the map, you can go straight into Quick Time by pressing the
     Quick Time key instead of selecting the "Exit" icon. This avoids having
     to return to the 3-D landscape.
        In Quick Time you will then see the "running man" move quickly across
     the map to your selected destination. To return to the 3-D landscape
     during a Quick Time journey, press The Quick Time key (Function Key F4)
     again. You will then find yourself moving along in Autoroute mode.
        If, during a Quick Time journey, you pass close to a building or
     person of significance, or an enemy vehicle, or you approach the
     coastline in a vehicle unable to cross it, "excitement detection" will
     be triggered. Your Quick Time journey will be terminated, and you will
     be put back into the 3-D landscape to deal with the situation.
        Once youreach your selected destination in Quick Time, you will be
     put into the 3-D landscape automatically.
        If your Quick Time or Autoroutejourney has been interrupted, either
     by yourself or by "excitement detection", you can wander some distance
     off chosen route. Nevertheless, youcan still, in most circumstances,
     resume your automatic journey by pressing the Quick Time or Autoroute
     keys. You will be steered back towards your chosen route. However, if
     you are near the coastline in a vehicle unable to cross it youmay
     encounter difficulties.

     CHAPTER 14 - MAKING CONTACTS & MEETING PEOPLE

     The area available for you to cover whilst playing "Flames of Freedom"
     is vast, and is filled with a myriad of characters with varying looks,
     personality and intentions.
        Some of them are agents of the Saharan Empire who will betray you
     given half a chance. Others are uncommitted to either side, and are
     ripe for recruitment. Some are known friends and agents of the
     Federation. The challenge for youis to learn to tell the difference
     between them, and then act accordingly.
        When you are close enough to someone for conversation to take place,
     the "Talk" icon will appear in the Special Actions window. Press the
     Special Actions key (Function Key F1) to meet them.
        The person's portrait will appear, along with his or her name,
     occupation, age and sex.
        The time and date are also shown, along with an "Exit" icon, in the
     upper right corner, which may be selected to return to the 3-D
     environment, and a "Shake Hands" icon, in the lower left corner, which
     may be selected to talk to the person.
        The person may be one yourecognise  immediately as a friend or foe,
     and therefore youmight not want to engage the person in conversation
     immediately. If youwant to avoid talking to the person, select exit to
     return to the 3-D environment. To talk to them select to "shake hands".
        When you shake hands with the person, one of three things may
     happen; Immediate

                                      -Page 69-

     Assistance, Conditional Help, pr Persuasion.

     IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE

     Some people are eager to help you immediately, You can accept or reject
     thishelp, as explained later.

     CONDITIONAL HELP

     Some people will offer to help you, provided that youfulfill certain
     conditions that they specify. The conditions take a similar form to
     mission objectives, and include assassination, sabotage, recruitment,
     rescue, destruction of particular enemy unit or seizure of vital
     documents.
        A screen will brief youas to the conditions to be met. Most such
     characters will require youto fulfill just one condition.
     Occasionally, you will be required to fulfill as many as three. These
     will be stepped through automatically.
        You must fulfill all the conditions set, and then talk to the person
     again to gain their help.

     PERSUASION

     Some people need to be persuaded to help you. You may use any of your
     psychological skills to persuade the person, namely Charm, Sex Appeal,
     Bribery, Threats, Reason, Pleading, Authority or Deception. Each of
     these skills is represented by anicon which will appear across the
     bottom of the screen. You cannot use sex appeal on a member of your
     own sex, but can select any of the other icons (using the "Icon
     button") in the hope of persuading the character to help you.
        It will obviously benefit you to use a skill at which youare highly
     rated, but it is also important that youuse a skill to which the
     person you have met is susceptible. A balance must be struck!
        Once you use a skill, the person's reaction will be given. This may
     take one of three forms. He will help you, or he will refuse to help
     you, or he will remain non-commital. If he remains non-commital, you
     can try another skill in an effort to persuade him. If he refuses to
     help, no other means of persuasion will work. However, you can still
     enlist his help be getting someone else to contact him for you (if
     there is anyone who will do that).
        In some cases, the person may be so hostile towards your method of
     approach that he or she becomes violent causing you physical damage.

                                      -Page 70-

     BETRAYAL

     If the person is a traitor, they will betray you to the Secret Police.
     Traitors behave exactly like any other character until it comes to the
     point when youwould normally be offered help. Instead, you will be
     arrested and imprisoned in the nearest Secret Police HQ, (as explained
     in Chapter 15, Escaping Capture, starting on page 75).
        More often than not, traitors will say that they are eager to help
     you; you will get arrested as soon as you accept their offer to help.
     Sometimes traitors will pretend to need persuasion; as soon as youhit
     on the right method, you will be betrayed. The worst case is a traitor
     who sets conditions; you go through all the effort of helping them,
     only to be rewarded by arrest and imprisonment!
        All traitors are craven cowards. Having betrayed you once, a traitor
     will never betray youagain - he is terrified of your taking revenge,
     and will do all he can to help you.

     HELP OFFERED

     The Help offered by a character may take one of nine forms, each of
     which are represented by the following icons;

     MAN WITH A BLINDFOLD - Secret Journey

     TIRE - Transport

     HOUSE - Shelter

     GUNS & AMMO - Weapons

     PASSPORT - Papers

     MOUTH WITH A "I" - Knowledge

     MAN - Contacts

     EXPLODING HOUSE - Assignments

     RED CROSS & HAND IN BANDAGE - Treatment

     More than one type of help may be offered by each person youenlist.
     You may choose all types of help offereed, just some of them, or none
     at all. To receive the help, select the required icon via the icon
     button.

                                      -Page 71-

     SECRET JOURNEY

     A person may offer to take youto meet another person whom is known to
     them, but whose whereabouts are to remain secret. Typically such a
     person might be a high ranking member of the local resistance, whose
     life would be endangered by anyone gaining knowledge of how to find
     them.
        If youselect the "Secret Journey" icon, a screen will brief you
     as to whom youwill be taken to meet, giving yousome information about
     them. Yoy may, at that stage accept or reject the offer via the
     "thums-up" or "-down" icons.
        Once youaccept the offer, the journey will be made automatically
     and youwill effectively be "blindfold" for a while. The clock will
     update to take account of the time taken for the journey, and youwill
     "open your eyes" to be greeted by the person you have been taken to
     meet. You can then talk to him in the hope of gaining his help.
        If youare offered "Secret Journey" as one of several types of help,
     youmight like to accept that help last of all, as youwill be taken on
     your secret journey immediately, and will no longer be able to talk to
     your helper.

     TRANSPORT

     A person may offer you a form of transport for your personal use. The
     mode of transport will be shown via a briefing screen when youselect
     the "Transport" icon. You may choose to accept or reject the offer of
     Transport by selecting either the "thumbs-up" or "-down" icons. You
     will immediately find yourself in the 3-D environment at the controls
     of your new vehicle.

     SHELTER

     A person may offer to shelter youfrom the Saharan Forces for a while,
     which is especially useful if the enemy are in hot oursuit and you have
     limited resources at your disposal. When youemerge from hiding, the
     enemy will no longer be hunting for you and have a period of grace,
     during which you can make your escape.

     WEAPONS

     A person may offer youweapons for your personal use. The weapons system
     offered will be shown via a briefing screen when youselect the
     "Weapons" icon. You may choose to accept or reject the offer of a Weapon
     by selecting wither the "thums-up"

                                      -Page 72-

     or "-down" icons. Once youtake a weapon youmay use it in the 3-D
     environment.

     PAPERS

     A person may offer youpapers for your peronal use. The quality of the
     papers offered will be shown via a briefing screen when youselect the
     "Papers" icon. The quality may range from excellent, through good and
     average, to poor. You may choose to accept or reject the offer of
     papers by selecting either the "thumbs-up" or "-down" icons.
          Once youhold Saharan papers youwill have an increased chance of
     passing by enemy units without being attacked. The chances of not being
     attacked increase as the quality of the papers improve. However, once
     youopen fire on an enemy unit, they will retaliate. Papers are valid
     until youselect a new mission.

     KNOWLEDGE

     A person may offer youvaluable information regarding the location of
     people, vehicles or weapons. The locations will be shown via a map
     screen, the exact position being indicated by the appropriate roundel.
     The information will be automatically added to your notebook.

     CONTACTS

     A person may offer to contact people they know and enlist their help
     prior to your meeting them. They will be eager to help as soon as you
     talk to them. Their locations will be shown via a map screen.

     ASSIGNMENTS

     A person may offer to perform an assignment for you, be it sabotage,
     rescue, murder, or the ambushing of an enemy unit. The nature of the
     assignment will be revealed via a briefing screen. You may choose to
     accept or reject the offer of help by selecting either the "thumbs-up"
     or "-down" icons. If youaccept it, the assignment will be carried out
     automatically whilst you wait in safety, The execution of an
     assignment can often, if you are fortunate, result in the completion
     of a mission objective.

                                      -Page 73-

     TREATMENT

     A person may offer youmedical assistance. The person's medical skills
     will range from poor, through average and good, to excellent. Each
     level of skill will allow them to repair one damaged body part in a
     session. Once youhave taken all the help yourequire, select the
     "exit" icon to return to the initial meeting screen. Select the "exit"
     icon once again to return to the 3-D environment.

     CHAPTER 15 - ESCAPING FROM CAPTURE

     When a traitor betrays you, you will be arrested be the Saharan Empire's
     brutal Secret Police Force.
        You will be taken to and held in a cell in the nearest Secret Police
     Headquarters, where youmay suffer physical punishment. However, the
     more significant consequence of being arrested is the loss of your
     liberty and the reduction of time available before the Saharan Armada
     sets sail. It is in your interests to escape deom prison as quickly as
     possible whilst trying to preserve your health. The more trouble you
     cause the Saharan EmpireSecret Police, the worse they will treat you.
        The screen which appears once you are in prison shows the portrait
     of your guard, along with some information about your predicament,
     including his or her name.
        Above this information are clock and calendar showing time and date.
     In the lower left hand corner is a "chalk-mark". This shows the number
     of days which youhave spent in prison.
        You will be watched by a different guard every day, and every day
     youmay try to escape if youwish. Each guard has different
     susceptibilities.
     Some have several weaknesses, while other have virtually nil. You must
     decide whether you want to attempt an escape, bearing in mind that if
     youattempt to escape and are caught, you will be severely beaten and
     tortured. It is not desirable to be free from prison in a matter of
     days if it will take a couple of weeks for your body to recover from
     its ordeal.

     To do nothing for 24 hours, select the "Do Nothing" icon.

     Once you have chosen to attempt an escape, you must decide which plan
     to use. You may choose to attempt bribe the guard, attack the guard,
     or seduce the guard (if they are of the opposite sex), by selecting the
     relevant icon.

     MONEY PILE - Bribe

     FIST - Attack

     LIPS - Seduce

     MOON/SUN - Do Nothing

     The outcome of your escape attempt will be shown. If youare successful,
     you will be returned to the 3-D environment. If you are caught trying to
     escape, you will be beaten, tortured, and returned to your cell with a
     different guard. The only way to exit the jail sequence isto escape,
     unless youspend twenty days there. After thistime youwill be
     automatically rescued, but the time penalty incurred is disastrous for
     your chances of

                                      -Page 76-

     liberating enough islands before the armada sails.
        Each guard behaves in a predictable fashion, and if you get to know
     all the prison guards well, youwill be able to take the best possible
     approach to each. Unfortunately, one day in seven each guard has an
     "off" day, and does the opposite of what youmight expect! Sometimes
     this is the only opportunity youwill get to escape from a vicious
     guard.

                                      -Page 78-

     CHAPTER 16 - YOUR NOTEBOOK

     With so much happening in Flames of Freedom, you might find it difficult
     to keep track of everything. To help you on your missions, you are given
     a notebook which will automatically be updated for you. The notebook may
     be seen by pressing the Notebook key (Function Key F7).

     The notebook menu shows your portrait, the time and date, and the number
     of days spent on the current mission. At the bottom of the screen are
     seven icons, each of which will display a different section of the
     notebook when selected. They are;

     SHOW CONTACTS. (MAN IN A HAT)

     Selecting this icon will display the name and portrait of one of your
     contacts (i.e. a person youhave knowledge of who is eager to help
     you). The three icons in the upper right-hand corner step through the
     contacts forwards, backwards, and return to the notebook menu
     respectively. By selecting to step forwards youmay see all your
     contacts in turn. Note that, above each contacts name, the word
     "Contacted" or "Contact" appears, depending upon whether you have met
     them yet or not. Remember that not every single contact can be trusted.
     Some may be traitors!

     PEOPLE MET (HANDSHAKE)

     Selecting thisicon will display the name and people of one of the
     people youhave 

                                      -Page 79-

     met on the island. The functions of the three icons in the upper right
     hand corner are identical to those described above. Above the persons
     name a message will appear. This may be one of five types.

     a) "offered help by..." indicates that the person gave you, or offered
        you help of one sort or another. You may have taken all the help the
     charcter has to offer, or youmay not. If the character still offers
     help which you have not accepted, the relevant "Help" icon will appear
     on the bottom of the screen. (See page 71 of "Meeting people and making
     contacts" for more information about the icons). Selecting this"Help"
     icon will have no effect at present. You must return to the person to
     get help.

     b) "Will help if..." indicates that the person offered youconditional
        help, the conditions of which have not yet been satisfied. By
     selecting the "thumbs-up" icon youmay see the conditions of the help.
     (See page 70 of "Meeting people and making contacts" for more
     information about conditional help).

     c) "Talked to..." indicates that you met and talked to the person, but
        have not tried to persuade them to help, or that they remained
     non-commital and may still help youif you return to them.

     d) "Refused help by..." indicates that the person refused to help you
        despite your using one of your psychological skills on him or her.
     Such people cannot be persuaded to help, even if youreturn to them on
     the island.

     e) "Traitor!" indicates that the person betrayed you to the Secret
        Police, at which time you were captured, tortured and beaten.

     ENEMY UNITS DESTROYED (EXPLOADING TANK)

     Selecting thisicon will show any enemy units which youhave destroyed.
     For each unit you will see the portrait and name of its commanding
     officer, the number of vehicles lost, the number remaining, and any
     bonus earned for their destruction. A picture of the type of vehicle
     destroyed is also shown. The three icons in the upper right-hand
     corner step through the enemy units forwards, backwards, and return
     to the notebook menu respectively. By selecting to step forwards you
      may see all the enemy units which you have destroyed in turn. (For
     more information on destroying enemy units, please see page 55 of
     "Engaging the Enemy").

                                      -Page 80-

     BUILDING SABOTAGED (EXPLOADING HOUSE)

     Selecting thisicon allows you to see any of the buildings which you,
     or one of your helpers, have sabotaged and destroyed. For each building
     you will see its typa and location, along with a picture of it. The
     three icons in the upper right-hand corner step through the buildings
     forwards, backwards, and return to the notebook menu respectively. By
     selecting to step forwards youmay see all the buildings sabotaged in
     turn.

     WEAPONS AVAILABLE (GUN & AMMO)

     Selecting thisicon allows you to see any of the weapons currently
     available to you. For each weapon you will see its type and picture.
     The three icons in the upper right-hand corner step through the
     buildings forwards, backwards, and return to the notebook menu
     respectively. By selecting to step forwards youmay see all the
     weapons available in turn.

     PAPERS AVAILABLE (PASSPORT)

     Selecting thisicon allows youto see the papers currently available
     to you. You only ever hold one set of papers - the best of those you
     have been given.

     CAMPAIGN REWARDS (DOLLAR SIGNS)

     Selecting thisicon allows youto see the accumulated wealth, mission
     bonuses, and luxury goods which you have earned so far in the Campaign.

                                      -Page 81-

     CHAPTER 17 - SELF

     You may check on your psychological and physical profiles, and on your
     state of health by pressing the Self Key (Function Key F6) at any time.
        You cannot alter your psychological or physical profiles during a
     Raid or Campaign (youmust return to HQ and start again with a new
     character if youwant to do that), but you can check to see if there
     has been any improvement or deterioration in any particular trait.
        Your rating for a particular psychological trait will improve if you
     use it a lot when trying to persuade people to help you. However,
     improvements in one particular area will lead to a slight deterioration
     in others that you have not been using, as there is a trade-off between
     skill in one area and skill in another. For instance, if youhave been
     charming to everybody, your rating for Charm may have increased, but
     your rating for Authority will have decreased to balance it. To make an
     overall improvement you must keep a balance in the approaches youuse.
        Your physical traits (viewed by selecting the "heart" icon) may also
     change over time, according to the physical activity youdo.

     Reflexes       are enhanced by being in lots of 'collisions'.
     Sturdiness     is enhanced by being injured frequently.
     Endurance      is enhanced by running low on energy for some time.
     Recuperation   is enhanced by long periods of rest.
     Stamina        is improved by periods of energy intensive activity.

     Your physical profile may also take a turn for the worse, as long
     periods of convalescence will reduce Reflexes, Endurance, Recuperation
     and Stamina, whilst long periods spent held in detention by the enemy
     reduce Sturdiness.

     You may check on your state of health by selecting the "red cross" icon.

     Your body is comprised of six parts which may be either "undamaged" or
     "injured". They are your head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg,
     right leg. If a part becomes injured, it will be overlayed by a
     "Red Cross" symbol. The body parts, or combination of parts, which
     become injured determine which activities you will or will not be able
     to perform. Injured body parts will recover during long periods of rest.
     As a rule, head injuries will heal before body injuries, which, in turn,
     recover quicker than arm injuries. Leg injuries take longest to heal.
     However, if more than one limb is injured at any one time, some degree
     of simultaneous repair will take place.
        You may be offered first aid by a person you meet. (Please see page
     74 for more information about first aid).
        There are two other factors governing your State of Health;

                                      -Page 83-

     a) Energy Reserves, which represents your total stock of energy

     b) Muscle Power, which represents your "instantaneous" energy

     Energy Reserves are shown by the number of "running man" icons at the
     bottom of the screen. One yellow man is shown for each "full tank"
     available. When they need replenishing they turn red.
        Muscle Power is shown by the larger "running man" icon above the
     Energy Reserves. This acts as a "fuel gauge", the colouring draining
     away as tasks requiring energy are performed.
        When Muscle Power falls to zero, it is replenished automatically from
     your Energy Reserves, BUT thistriggers exhaustion (all actions take
     place at half-speed). To avoid exhaustion you must stop and rest before
     Muscle Power reaches zero. If yourun out of Energy Reserves, youwill
     blackout and be forced to stop and rest. After a sustained period of
     rest, during which you will eat and sleep, your Energy Reserves will
     recover.
        Once youhave finished viewing your psychological or physical
     traits, or your state of health, select the "Exit" icon to get back
     to the action.

                                      -Page 84-
                                      -Page 85-

     CHAPTER 18 - REST

     Whenever your Muscle Energy or Energy Reserves drop, youwill need to
     rest. You may want to rest if your body has sustained physical damage,
     so that time may heal your wounds.

     To rest, press the Rest key (Function Key F2).

     The screen shows your body on the left, with physical damage to any of
     your six body partsindicated by a "Red Cross". The "running man" icons
     at the bottom of the screen show your Muscle Power and Energy Reserves.
     The larger icon shows your Muscle Power, and is yellow when full,
     draining away to red when empty. If thisfuel gauge shows empty, you
     must rest for a short while to refill it from your Energy Reserves,
     shown by the six smaller "running man" icons below it. Yoy can, if you
     wish, replenish you Muscle Power and your Energy Reservesby simply
     stopping and doing nothing whilst still in the 3-D landscape. It might
     take some time, however.
        To top up your Muscle Power, select the "5 minutes" icon. The time
     shown on the clock will advance by five minutes and your Muscle Power
     will increase.
        If your Energy Reserves run low, you must stop for a much longer
     time, during which you will eat and sleep. This is done by selecting
     the "Hours" icon. You will rest for one hour, during which time one
     Energy Reserve tank will be replenished. The clock will advance one
     hour.
        You may take as many minutes or hours rest as youwish by a
     continuous press of the "Icon button".

                                      -Page 86-

     If yourest for hours, the injuries you have sustained will continue
     their healing processes. Once a body part becomes fully functional
     again the Red Cross will disappear. They may not heal completely while
     youare resting, but they will be closer to recovery.
        Once you have finished resting, select the "Action" icon.

                                      -Page 87-
                                      -Page 88-

     CHAPTER 19 - ACHIEVING YOUR MISSION OBJECTIVES

     Throughout your missionyoumay review your missionobjectives by
     pressing the Objectives key (Function Key F8). Your objectives will
     be stepped through on screen, with a "return to the action" icon in
     the lower left corner which may be selected at any time.
        The number of objectives which comprise a mission varies, but on
     each mission, every objective must be achieved for the successful
     completion of the mission.
        As each objective is completed during a mission, Control will appear
     to inform you of the fact, immediately on your return to the 3-D
     environment. The completed mission objective will appear, overlayed by
     the Federation's seal of approval, with a "return to the action" icon
     in the lower left corner.
        He may also appear to inform you that your actions have now
     satisfied the conditions for help laid down by one of the people you
     have met. To gain help offered youmust return to the person.
        Eventually youwill achieve your final objective. You will be told
     of its completion, in the normal way. Once youselect the "return to
     action" icon, you will be told of your overall mission's succesful
     completion. Your missionobjectives, each overlayed by the Federation
     seal of approval for a job well done, will appear in turn. Select the
     "return to action" icon again to see the updated political map of the
     Slave Isles, with the island you have just liberated turning pink.
        As a proud and willing servant of the Atlantic Federation youwill
     no doubt be filled with joy. As further reward for liberating the
     island, the local people will thrust luxury goods upon youin thanks
     for your work, and Control will inform youof your financial bonus to
     be paid by the Federation.
        On completion of each island youare also given a Secret Weapon to
     use on later missions. (Information about the Secret Weapons which you
     can collect can be found in Appendix B on page 138). Finally, the value
     of your luxury items and bonus are added to any rewards gained for the
     destruction of enemy units, and then combined with wealth accumulated
     from other missions to give your total wealth.
        You will then return to Agora for rest and recuperation. The lenght
     of time needed for your body to recover from its ordeal will depend on
     the amount of punishment taken during the mission. The Federation
     stipulates a minimum recuperation period of five days.
        You must save your campaign to disk at thisstage. Once youare fit
     and well, youmust report back to the Federation HQ to be briefed for
     your next mission.

                                      -Page 89-

     CHAPTER 20 - THE ARMADA

     Atlantic Federation intelligence reports have allowed us to establish
     enough facts about the massing Saharan Armada to allow us to make
     detailed predictions about their actions after they set sail for Agora.
     Whilst youwill not be actively engaging the Armada for an estimated
     six months after your enrollment as a Special Field Operative, your
     work in that period must take into account the Armada's likely route
     to Agora. In fact, your work before the Armadasets sail will force
     the routetaken by the Armada.
        You can use Strategic Planning to see a wholly accurate simulation
     of the Armada's route at any time youreturn to HQ between missions.
     You can see, as descussed on pages 30-31, that the route taken by the
     Armada follows certain rules. What is harder to predict is the speed
     and ease with which they will travel. That depends on your actions
     before they sail, as each liberated island contributes more brigades
     to your force, and on your actions after the Armada sails, as the
     Federation forces cannot defeat the Armada on their own. Your
     individual input is crucial.
        You can be certain of one thing. Once youreceive the message telling
     youthat the Saharan Armada has set sail, you must abort the current
     mission and prepare to engage the Armada. You will not be allowed to
     complete the current mission. However, you can still enlist people from
     any island and gain their help.

     THE COMPOSITION OF THE SAHARAN ARMADA

     The structure of the Saharan Forces within the Armada is believed to
     differ from that normally encountered on islands. The Armada consists
     of around 60 units, combined for travel into about 20 Battle Groups.
     The individual units will not be shown on the Main Map, but the Battle
     Groups will be. Each Battle Group is designated as either an Air Force
     Battle Group, Amphibious Battle Group, Naval Battle Group or Army
     Battle Group, and these four types are shown by Zeppelin, Hovercraft,
     Ship and TAnk roundels respectively.
        However, a Naval Battle Group, for instance, need not consist solely
     of sea-going craft. They may well have limited aerial support from a
     unit of biplanes, which are under the command of the same Naval Group.
        Army battle groups are carried by ship and disembarked onto any
     liberated islands which the Saharan Armada is forced to pass by. The
     Army units, (and close by Amphibious units), will head for the interior
     of the island to battle with brigades fighting alongside the Federation.
        Whilst such battles are being fought, the Naval units will travel
     further around the coast to rendezvous with the Army units after the
     battle. If either the Naval or Army units are destroyed before the
     rendezvous point, the other will desert and so both will be lost.
        As with any invasion force, the Saharan Armada will consist of units
     whose abilities range from average conscrips, to elite crack troops. As
     youliberate islands, brigades will be

                                      -Page 91-

     contributed to the Federation forces. These allied brigades will be best
     equipped to engage the average Saharan units. Your job is to take on the
     elite. Elite units will reach Agora regardless of the opposition they
     face from Federation brigades. Only you, in person, can finish them off.

     THE ATTRITION RATE OF THE ARMADA

     The Attrition rate varies according to how actively the Armadais being
     engaged. This fundamentally depends on whether the Armada Battle Groups
     are passing islands which you have liberated. Liberated islands will
     force the Armada to suffer far higher rates of attrition as they house
     brigades of allied troops. The number of brigades available to engage
     the Armada varies from islandto island.
        The longer the distance youcan force the Armadato travel, the more
     attrition they will suffer. The more liberated islands you can force
     them to pass, the more attrition they will suffer. If you can force the
     Armada to take a difficult route and if you can liberate enough islands
     to form a large Federation counter-force, then most or all of the
     Armada's conscript Battle Groups will be destroyed without your personal
     intervention. This will leave only a handful of elite Battle Groups for
     you to polish off personally.
        If, on the other hand, youhave blundered on your missions,
     liberating only a few islands and leaving the Armada an easy route to
     Agora, then stopping the Armadabecomes an almost superhuman task. Up to
     twenty massive Battle Groups will reach Agora more or less intact and
     you will personally have to destroy 4 to 5 times as many enemy vehicles
     to win the campaign.
        You may find it easier to engage enemy on and around non-liberated
     islands, as such islands will not be battle-worn and should still
     contain lots of spare vehicles and ammunition, and people to help you.
        As can be seen by running a Strategic Planning simulation, the
     Armadamoves in waves. Some Battle Groups will cover ground very
     quickly. However, their attrition rate may be high. Others move more
     slowly but may keep more of their Group intacts.
        Finally, do not expect the Armada to follow their predicted path
     blindly into an ambush you have set up. If youmerely sit and wait
     aloung their route they will divert to avoid you. You must actively seek
     them at all times.

     WINNING OR LOSING

     For the Atlantic Federation and the Slave Isles to be rid of the
     scourge of Saharan domination, the entire Armada must be destroyed. Such
     a show of strenght will undoubtedly incite all unliberated Slave Isles
     to rebel in unison, thus crushing the Empire's forces and pushing them
     back to the African mainland. Such a victory will amke its instigator a
     worldwide hero. Such acclaim awaits you.

                                      -Page 92-

        Defeat, on the other hand, is not easy to contemplate. If any Battle
     Groups of the Saharan Armada reach the COBRA HQ or Union on Agora, the
     game will be up. Agora will become the forty-second Slave Isle.
        You have the opportunity to return a hero. There is a chance you
     will trail back in shame. Flames of Freedom is all about you making
     the right decisions at the right time. Choosing the correct option from
     the vast range available. Executing your actions with deadly accuracy.
        You have many tools, of which this handbook is one, at your disposal.
     The future of the Atlantic Federation is now being passed into your
     hands.

        If you are impatient to get to grips with the Armada, press the "A"
     key whilst in the 3-D landscape. This will trigger the Armada instantly.

                                THE SLAVE ISLES
                                ---------------

     LOBOS

     A key stronghold island controlling the western region of the Saharan
     Empire, Lobos is the home port of the Imperial Occidental Fleet. Radar
     installations guard the approaches to the huge natural anchorage at
     Deep Water. Amongst the units stationed on thisisland are Sea Hawk
     Flying Submarine Squadrons commanded by the notorious Amandu Dengal.
     Your overall mission is to liberate the island, the loss of which will
     cripple the Empire's western capability.

     1) Assassinate Admiral Amandu Dengal, commander of the infamous elite
        Imperial flying sub unit known as the Sea Hawk.

     2) Sabotage the radar at Outlook Island, the radar station which alerts
        the Empire of any ships approaching Deepwater Bay, and the heart of
        their naval forces on Lobos

     3) Sabotage the underwater base at Deepwater Sound, the heavily
        fortified centre of naval operations.

                                      -Page 94-

     DHAFRA

     The island is the location for the Empire's Northern Sector Command
     Headquarters. It is stronghold of prime importance; every element of
     the enemies' services are present on the island. In addition Dhafra is
     the Empire's major source of uranium and iron ore. Local miners are
     known to be sympathetic to our cause. The overall mission is to
     actively incite the population to rebel.

     1) Enlist Doctor Habib Ayyub the geologist, who is a much liked and
        respected member of Dhafra's community.

     2) Enlist Jan Karlstaad a sympathiser to the cause, but wary of
        strangers.

     3) Enlist George Davies, an ex-miner with many friends.

     4) Sabotage the Secret Police HQ at Boulder Valley.

     5) Sabotage the Enemy HQ at Blackridge Plateau.

     6) Sabotage the Radio Station at Blackridge Plateau.

                                      -Page 95-

     CAMARGO

     Camargo is the HQ of the Imperial Armoured Corps, where the elite
     armoured units undergo rigorous battle training. The entire
     south-eastern peninsular has been turned into a massive walled ghetto,
     named Eden. Here, politicians, revolutioners, resistance fighters, and
     those who have simply dared to speak ill of the Empire are forced to
     live in terrible, disease-ridden conditions. Those who survive disease
     eventually meet their end at the hands of the Imperial Police death
     squads. An armed breakout from the ghetto is the key to liberating
     Camargo.

     1) Enlist General Fadi al-HAdi, one of the most influential officials
        in the Imperial Army.

     2) Rescue Lieutenant Ziad Sirhan, the Resistance Leader held in the
        notorious Eden Ghetto.

                                      -Page 96-

     PANAO

     Agora's air defences are constantly probed and tested by fighter
     squadrons from the Atlantic Fields airbase on the west of Panao. The
     island itself is rocky and mountainous. There is a small fishing
     industry, tin mining and some farming. Governer Farinola, a right-wing
     fanatic, has Panao firmly under his control. His trusted partner in
     terror, Dr. Burquest, has brainwashed many of the islands key
     personnel. Your objectives is to depose Farinola by getting the
     Army, the Air Force and the Police on our side.

     1) Enlist Catherine Ellis, only daughter of the chief of Secret Police.
        If she's on our side, her father is sure to help us - he dotes on
        her.

     2) Enlist Magdala Umar, wife of the military commandant. He does
        everything she tells him to, principally to avoid her incessant
        nagging.

     3) Enlist Colonel Masi Bourguiba, Air Force Commander on Panao. His
        help will be vital in liberating the island.

                                      -Page 97-

     GAMBOA

     A lush and verdant island, Gamboa is run by the Secret Police Narcotics
     Bureau. Opiates are cultivated here by the Bureau and then smuggled to
     Agora in an attempt to subvert the population. The abundant narcotics
     crop is also used to keep the local population under control. Under the
     very noses of the Secret Police, the resistance operate a highly
     effective escape pipeline from Gamboa, but to free the island youmust
     disable its narcotics industry.

     1) Enlist Albert Price, chief chemist for the Narcotics Bureau, whose
        girlfriend is held in slavery to ensure Price's loyalty.

     2) Seize documents containing the names of all Narcotics Bureau
        personnel and informers.

     3) Destroy Colonel Makonnen's Flying sub squadron, an elite Secret
        Police unit which is currently trying to locate and smash the
        resistance.

     4) Sabotage everything at Stony Shore the major centre for narcotics
        processing on the island.

                                      -Page 98-

     IQUITOS

     Iquitos is the headquarters of the Imperial Propoganda ministry, its
     radio stations beaming a constant stream of fiction towards the island
     of Agora. Although it is a frequent port of call for merchant ships
     plying their trade between the nearby islands, much of Iquitos remains
     an unspoilt tropical paradise, a tranquil haven for the rich and the
     famous.
        Your charm and pleading will be crucial in gaining the help of the
     islands jet-set. As well nas silencing the voice of the Empire, you
     must also wreck the island's sea trade.

     1) Sabotage the Radio Station at Echo Pass, the main source of Saharan
        Propaganda, the aim of which is to subvert the population of Agora.

     2) Enlist Feodor Dvorak, millionaire businessman and recluse. He is
        known to be generous and will be able to bribe the island's governor
        to relinquish control.

     3) Destroy Major Bamba's speedboat squadron which guards the islands
        vital trade routes.

                                      -Page 99-

     MARACAY

     This island seethes with intrigue and espionage. The free port on the
     south-western coast has been likened to the pre-flood colony of Hong
     Kong. Every secret organisation, for good or evil, has an agent
     representing its interests on the island. In addition to agents, you
     will encounter secret societies, racketeers and various other criminal
     elements. Trust no one.

     1) Enlist Cadi Soromenho, an agent, under the guise of a businessman,
        has infiltrated numerous Imperial agencies. The information he has
        will be of great help in destroying Imperial commerce.

     2) Rescue Janine Howard, a renowned journalist, who is under constant
        Imperial Police surveillance, because she might give far from
        beneficial reports on their activities and practices.

                                      -Page 100-

     CALABAR

     Calabar exports exotic spices, silk and a cornucopia of natural
     medicines extracted from its rare tropical plants. The island is a haven
     for deserters from Dhafra, who have a hideaway in the mountainous
     interior. In the south, the Air Force have a tropical disease research
     centre as well as an airbase. You must encourage the Saharan deserters
     to take up arms againts their persecutors and at the same time gain
     the cooperation of the civil authorities. Bribery and threats should
     prove useful.

     1) Enlist Lady Rowena Harper, the Gouverner of Calabar. She represents
        the mainland's bureaucratic interference with Calabar's affairs.

     2) Enlist Anthony White, spokesman for the deserters. He'll probably
        want youto prove you're not an Saharan agent before he'll give his
        support.

     3) Assassinate Doctor Leslie Fisher, in charge of the Air Force's
        medical experiments. The islanders are terrified of him and no
        uprising is feasible until he's eliminated.

                                      -Page 101-

     ALEDO

     The Imperial Airforce use Aledo as a forward base for aerial
     surveillance on Agora. Enemy units include high level bombing zeppelins
     commanded by Major Nathan Owen. Underwater bases receive weapons by
     submarine from the Secret Weapons Establishment on Thar. Take notice
     that the resistance network has been penetrated. The overall mission
     is to render the island inoperable as an air base.

     1) Assassinate Major Nathan Owen, Commander of the Imperial high level
        bombing Zeppelin unit.

     2) Sabotage the printers at Qasir where anti-Federation propaganda
        leaflets are printed, and then dropped in their thousands from
        Imperial planes, onto populated areas, with the aim of demoralising
        our sympathisers.

                                      -Page 102-

     COROZAL

     Corozal is the major base for the Imperial Navy's Intelligence Service.
     Radar sited on high ground is used to scan the western approach from
     Agora to the mainland of Africa. Radio stations around the island
     monitor transmissions from Agora. Overall mission is to deprive the
     enemy of his intelligence gathering assets.

     1) Sabotage the Radio Station at West Island. 

     2) Sabotage the Underwater Base at White Cove.

     3) Enlist Christopher Jones.

     4) Enlist Emile Lamontagne.

     5) Destroy Major Wohlbruck's ship squadron.

     6) Assassinate Major Abbas Tabari.

                                      -Page 103-

     JEBBA

     Chaotically administered ny the corrupt and depraved Governer Hejaz,
     Jebba has a thriving black economy. Smuggling, gambling and the
     enslavery of unwary strangers are major sources of income. Frequented
     by the Imperial officer corps for their dubious recreation,Jebba is well
     garrisoned. It is also the HQ of the Secret Police Terror Executive, a
     ruthless commando force. Gain help from the Jebbans with bribery and
     deception. To liberate the island you must enlist the Governer and
     neutralize the Terror Executive, which exerts the only authority the
     Jebbans understand - mortal fear.

     1) Enlist Governor Gabriel Hejaz the corrupt and depraved Governor. He
        has many contacts and will be invaluable in undermining the power of
        the Secret Police.

     2) Sabotage everything at Morto where the elite Terror Executive is
        based.

     3) Rescue Ameera Shaalan grandson of Farah Beersheba. Beersheeba is the
        Godmother of the smuggling clan and her help is vital. The Terror
        Executive are holding Shaalan as a hostage.

     4) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Jamsun Sea. The woldpacks based
        there are a deep thorn in the side of the island's smugglers.
        Eliminating the base will win them over to your cause.

                                      -Page 104-

     QAMAR

     The island od Qamar is home to two major cultures. A large wealthy
     English settlement on West Qamar, and an Arabic settlement on East
     Qamar. Deep within the Arabic sector, is hidden the Headquarters of
     the Imperial Zeppelin Corps, an elite reconnaisance and bombing unit.
     General Ali ibn Zahr, corrupt commander of the Corps and military
     governer of Qamar, takes protection money from West Qamar in return
     for leaving it alone. Consequently, there are no garrisons at all
     stationed in the West. Recently, intense Secret Police activity on both
     islands has finally placed the General and the Corps under suspicion of
     illegal activities. Your overall mission is to recruit the desperate
     Ali ibn Zahr to our cause.

     1) Enlist Governor Ali ibn Zahr military Governor of amar.

     2) Assassinate Anatolia Rihan.

     3) Sabotage the Secret Police HQ at Sakri Fields where incriminating
        evidence on the Governor is kept.

                                      -Page 105-

     MAJI

     The mountains of Maji provide an ideal location for an Imperial Weather
     station serving Dhafra. The Empire also uses this islandfor rest and
     recuperation. Imperial troops make sure that the island's two industries
     are gambling and crime. A corrupt judicary and legal profession ensure
     the prosperity of these dubious industries. Maji is also famous for its
     pirates. You must cut sea communications with other Imperial colonies
     and bring about the liberation of Maji.

     1) Destroy Lt. Kaunda's submarine squadron, off the western coast,
        cutting off the island's trade route.

     2) Destroy Maj. Sutton's submarine squadron, off the western coast,
        cutting off the island's trade route.

                                      -Page 106-

     CUBANGO

     Cubango has been torn apart by religious strife. This has been
     aggravated and exploited by the Empire, which operates a divide and
     rule policy. Sectarian murder is common on thisisland. The population
     is mistrustful and Imperial forces maintain a high state of alert. You
     must end the religious strife and allow a liberated Cubango to return
     to stable government.

     1) Assassinate Governor Albert Benson. Benson is an Imperial
        sympathiser, and if he ever realises his ambition to gain ownership
        of all of Cubango, then Imperial forces will get an even stronger
        foothold on the island.

                                      -Page 107-

     GAU

     Gau is controlled by two Mafia-type families. The Doua's in the south,
     and the Oqbah's in the north. The Empire often indulges itself in
     hiring the exceptional skills of their assassins and hit-men.
        Recently Nasif Namali, a General with the Saharan Army, well known
     for his outspoken hatred of the Mafia and some aspects of Saharan life,
     went into hiding after killers hired by the Empire began searching for
     him. Namali is a desperate man, who might be willing to help us. Your
     overall mission is to free Gau from Empire and Mafia rule.

     1) Enlist General Nasif Namali, who is in hiding in fear of his life.
        His refusal to help the two Mafia families on Gau, and his views on
        how the Saharan Empire conducts its affairs, have made him a much
        wanted man by both parties.

                                      -Page 108-

     VITORIA

     Once a tranquil and verdant haven, Vitoria was settled by pioneers of
     the green movement to use as a living laboratory for alternative
     technology and communal living. When the Empire discovered rich deposits
     of brown coal and iron ore, the lush interior becamer heavily
     industrialised. Because physical violence is against the principles of
     the green pioneers, the rest of the island is barely garrisoned at all
     but powered vehicles are also rare. To win the hearts and minds of the
     islanders, youmust shut down the heavy industry. Reason, charm and
     pleading are useful skills.

     1) Enlist Captain Bernard Ellis, the general manager of the Imperial
        Steel Corporation. His help is vital in shutting down the island's
        steel mills.

     2) Seize documents, a geological survey supressed by the Government to
        avoid a mine worker's strike. The report predicts massive earthquakes
        and flooding if mining continues.

     3) Rescue Elizabeth Shaw, the ecology expert and green activist. The
        Secret Police are holding her somewhere. Her rescue will rally the
        islanders to our cause.

     4) Enlist Hugh Evans, President of the Union of Coal Miners. The Police
        have framed him, on fraud charges and now he's in hidding. The miners
        will follow him to a man.

                                      -Page 109-

     SIKASSO

     This island is the home of two deadly neighbours, the Imperial Secret
     Police, who use it as their interrogation HQ, and the League of
     Assassins, a brotherhood of professional killers who sell their
     organisations detest each other. You must exploit the mutual dislike
     between the Police and the League, destroy the power of the assassins
     and compromise the Secret Police.

     1) Assassinate Andre Freitas, head of Sikasso's League of Assassins.
        With luck this will force a conflict between the Assassins and the
        Secret Police, as undoubtedly the League will blame the murder on
        them.

     2) Seize documents, containing incriminating photographs of the Head of
        the Secret Police, highly delicate in nature.

                                      -Page 110-

     ZAFRIYA

     Centre of the Imperial fishing industry, Zafriya sends supplies of dried
     fish from its processing and canning plants to all of the Empire's
     garrisons. The workforce has been ruthlessly exploited by the Empire,
     and in order to augment their existance they have resorted to piracy.
     Although some inhabitants are fiercely loyal to our cause, others are
     treacherous in the extreme.

     1) Enlist Firouzeh al-Hamik, a resistance fighter who is believed to
        have gathered information likely to be useful to the Federation
        intelligence.

     2) Sabotage everything at Boulder peninsula from where the enemy flies
        out food supplies to bases on mainland Africa.

     3) Enlist Lufti al-Zasir, a smuggler known to frequent the seedier
        areas of Angel Cove, who has reached a business understanding with
        Imperial Officers.

                                      -Page 111-

     DJOUM

     Because of its close proximity to the African mainland, and the
     diversity of terrain types found there, Djoum is used by the Saharan
     Empire as the ideal military training centre for its newly recruited
     troops. Here, Imperial soldiers, sailors and airmen undergo six months
     of intense training in all fields of modern warfare, until they are
     considered worthy enough to fight in the ranks of the Imperial army.
     Djoum is also the location of the Headquarters of the much feared
     Imperial Death Squad, a special judicial unit, created to investigate
     reports of misconduct within the echelons of the Imperial Army and
     Secret Police.

     1) Sabotage everything at Feraigat Fields an important military munition
        dump, where a handful of the Empire's best scientists create and
        manufacture devastating weapons.

     2) Assassinate Major Lwamgira Baikiw, a major in the Imperial Army,
        whose death will smash enemy morale.

     3) Assassinate Leiutenant Hassan Hilmi, Hangman with the Imperial Death
        Squad. His death will turn others against their leaders.

                                      -Page 112-

     SATARA

     Situated close to the African mainland, Satara is heavily industrialized
     with a proliferation of armaments and munitions factories. The arms
     industry encourages a considerable amount of smuggling to resistance
     groups. The islandis also the HQ for the Imperial Marine Corp. The main
     underground movement has formed a government in waiting, ready to
     seize control of the island as soon as it is liberated. Your overall
     mission is to recruit governmant in waiting and assist it in taking
     control of the island.

     1) Recruit Mulela Kouyate, businessman and leading member of Satara's
        exiled government.

     2) Assassinate Zwide Tozer, Imperial Governor of Satara.

     3) Recruit Kgari Gamoudi, quality controller for the Empire's arms
        factory.

                                      -Page 113-

     THAR

     Formed by a now dormant volcano, this rugged island is exploited by the
     Empire as a location for its Secret Weapon Establishment. Little is
     known of this highly secret installation. Recently fishermen from
     Zafriya, who had been pressed into service with the Imperial Mercantile
     Fleet, reported seeing Professor Gabriel D'Angeli on the dockside at
     Bird Quay. Professor D'Angeli is known to be a keen supporter of the
     Federation. Your overall mission is to locate D'Angeli and destroy all
     elements of the research establishment. Be warned - Thar is heavily
     guarded.

     1) Enlist Gabriel D'Angeli, who is known to be a keen supporter of the
        Federation.

     2) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Bird Water. Used for secret weapons
        development.

     3) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Lodi. Used for secret weapons
        development.

     4) Rescue Brother Jaques Dubrique, an active member of the resistance.

     5) Sabotage the factory at Bird Lowlands, used for weapons production.

     6) Sabotage the factory at Lodi, used for weapons production.

     7) Sabotage the factory at Firengi Pass, used for weapons production.

                                      -Page 114-

     GRAN PARADISO

     Gran Paradiso was home to one of the largest resistance movements in
     the Slave Isles, until Imperial Agents tracked down and imprisoned
     leader of the resistance, Amilcar Tsombe. Without Tsombe's leadership
     the movement fragmented into three smaller groups. The leaders of each
     group have differing views and ideals, so they remained estranged from
     one and other, and weak in comparison to the Resistance under Tsombe.
     There is no sign at all of any co-operation between them, let alone an
     overall strategy. Your task on Gran Paradiso is to recruite the three
     resistance movements.

     1) Enlist Abbas Tabari, leader of the Amizade resistance movement.

     2) Enlist Muhmar Zaghlul, leader of the Laranja resistance movement.

     3) Enlist Houshang Biskra, leader of the Trovoados resistance movement.

                                      -Page 115-

     BOUREM

     Recently, Bourem was the location of an industrial disaster, which
     caused thousands of deaths, and had a devastating effect upon the
     islands' ecology. Explosions at a chemical plant owned by Enrique
     Arnaud, billowed clouds of toxic gas into the atmosphere which laid
     waste to all life within ten mile radius. Arnaud was arrested and
     tried for manslaughter and negligence. The Judge returned a verdict
     of innocent. However, new evidence has come to light, suggesting that
     Arnaud paid off the Judge, and actually caused the accident himself
     to claim insurance money. Your mission is to seek out Arnaud and Judge
     Hopson, and serve justice in the eyes of the population.

     1) Assassinate Judge John Hopson, one of the chief conspirators in the
        Arnaud disaster.

     2) Assassinate Enrique Arnaud, manager of Arnaud Chemicals, and
        mastermind behind the plan to destroy his own factory.

                                      -Page 116-

     MAGHAR

     Maghar is the Imperial Army's heavily fortified punishment island, where
     misfits and law-breakers from the army, navy and airforce are drafted to
     serve in the notorious punishment battalions. paramilitary units of the
     Secret Police maintain law and order, but even they are wary of the
     Psycho Squad, a suicide unit comprised entirely of murderers and
     psychopaths. The other punishment battalions live in mortal fear of
     this squadron.
        With the help of his ill-treated common troops, Maghar can be
     liberated but mutiny is unthinkable whilst the Psycho Squad are still
     at large. You must eliminate this unit.

     1) Sabotage the Town Hall at Asali Reach. This is the main
        administrative centre on Maghar, which contains a complete library
        of files on prisoners past and present.

     2) Enlist General Patrick Holmes, Commander of Maghar's Psycho Squad.

                                      -Page 117-

     JEREZ

     The island is maintained by the Imperial Secret Police as a prison
     colony. The inhabitants are senior political and religious leaders who
     have been seized by the Empire from various islands who are now held as
     hostages. The island is heavily fortified. Take note that certain of the
     leading figures kept prisoner on the island have as little regard for
     the Federation as they do the Empire. Your mission is to liberate the
     prisoners so that they can return to their home islands to foster
     further revolt.

     1) Enlist Mullah Kush Alami, leader of the island's Islamic party.

     2) Enlist Bishop William Price, leader of the island's Christian party.

     3) Enlist Comrade Samantha White leader of the island's Communist party.

     4) Enlist Brother Gareth Ellis, leader of the island's Anarchist party.

                                      -Page 118-

     BENI MAZAR

     Sixty percent of Imperial oil reserves can be found under the soil of
     Beni Mazar. It is vital to the Saharans that they have a detailed paln
     to destroy all oil installations in the event of the island's
     liberation. Intelligence reports suggest that the nerve centre for any
     demolition operation will be a newly built underwater base. Your
     mission is to liberate Beni Mazar whilst avoiding the ecological
     disasater that would occur if the Empire implemented its scorched
     earth plan.

     1) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Mu'tab Sea, recently detected by
        resistance divers. It is thought to be a key Imperial military base.

     2) Enlist Ahmed Beersheeba, head of Beni Mazar's Resistance force.
        Beersheeba's regular radio reports to us unexplicably stopped last
        week and we are ow extremely concerned about his welfare.

                                      -Page 119-

     GHAZAL

     This islandis of key strategic importance as it guards the sea lanes
     used by the Empire to supply its south-eastern region. Naval patrols
     sailing out of ports dotted around Ghazal keep a regular guard. Since
     unmonitored access to the island is difficult, Ghazal makes an ideal
     location for the Imperial Mint. Be warned that the printers are
     specially selected for their honesty. Your overall missionis to cause
     economic and monetary chaos by liberating the island.

     1) Enlist Bianca Fregona, believed to be a Commander in the Ghazal
        Freedom Force.

     2) Assassinate Admiral Zufia Ibn Rushd. He is the master strategician
        behind the Ghazal's frontline of defence, and is staunchly loyal to
        the Empire's doctrines.

     3) Enlist Shireen Ibn Musa. Although employed by the Empire, unknown to
        them she is a supporter of the Atlantic Federation. Her position as
        Chief Radio Operator allows her access to Top Secret Imperial Files,
        this makes her an ideal target.

                                      -Page 120-

     NDOLA

     Ndola provides the HQ for the Saharan Colonial Civil Service and it is
     also the home of the Imperial Customs and Excise Head Office. There is
     known to be friction between the two organisations. In addition to the
     large garrison of Imperial troops, there is also a detachment of armed
     Excise officers. We believe that Imperial economic reform will result
     in the loss of thousands of Civil Service and Excise posts. If this
     information is leaked to the appropriate Civil Service Department,
     revolt is likely to ensue.

     1) Recruit Bosiu Alooma, a senior Civil Servant who will provide you
        with some information which will be helpful to your mission.

     2) Seize documents from Bosiu Alooma, detailing massive cuts in the
        Civil Service, and the lifting of internal tarrifs. This should be
        enough to cause chaos throughout the island.

                                      -Page 121-

     MAKAT

     The main source of Makat's income is obtained by providing a safe haven
     for runaway slaves, on their route to Gran Paradiso. In an effort to
     stop this, the Saharan Empire has enforced a naval and submarine cordon
     around the island, operating from an underwater base, to block the
     entry of any illegal imigrants. With the addition of numerous flying
     boat units operating within Makat's own airspace, the island is
     extremely well protected.
        Your overall mission is to disrupt Imperial defences on and around
     the island.

     1) Recruit Hikmat Sutuz, the man responsible for the safe passage of so
        many slaves through Makat to Gran Paradiso.

     2) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Deepwater. This will open up a direct
        route to Gran Paradiso.

                                      -Page 122-

     KHASH

     The Imperial Treasury is situated on Khash. At ports dotted around the
     islands, taxes, levies and tributes are received from the Empire's
     dependent and vassal islands. Hugh amounts of gold, precious stones and
     paper money are stored in banks at various sites. The population of this
     islandis relatively well treated by the Empire and is, in the main
     part, loyal to it. Your missionis to subvert the local population and
     deprive the enemy of a major source of revenue by which it maintains
     its military effort.

     1) Rescue Fahla Gammito, who has been arrested by the Imperial Secret
        Police on charges of spying.

     2) Enlist Hikmat al-Hadi, the leader of the local resistance.

     3) Enlist Musa Hilmi, software engineer to the Imperial Treasury.

     4) Assassinate Bakr Hejaz, the manager of the bank at Amarelo flats,
        which is part of the Imperial Treasury.

     5) Sabotage the Bank at Ironstone Flats, which is part of the Imperial
        Treasury.

     6) Sabotage the Bank at Matawin Ridge, which is part of the Imperial
        Treasury. The location of Matawin Ridge is unknown.

                                      -Page 123-

     MOCORITO

     The HQ for the Imperial Fighter Command, Mocorito is also the Empire's
     main location for the production of biplnes. The islandis famous for
     its air races and is a Mecca for racing pilots from both the Federation
     and the Empire. Because of its connection with the aero industry, the
     hospitals on Mocorito specialise in treatment for air crash injuries.
     The main resistance on the island is the Nurses Against Oppression
     Front. This island would be valuable addition to the Federation. You
     are charged with winning it for us.

     1) Recruit Hamdan Bustani, who is head of the Imperial fighter command.
        His defection will be a severe blow to the enemy. Bustani is renowned
        for being a ladies man.

     2) Rescue Yazid Tabari, the famous plastic surgeon who has refused the
        assist in the Empire's perverted medical experiments. For his crime
        he was thrown out of work and into prison.

     3) Destroy everything at Beni-Huruth Hills, the biplane production
        factory. This will have a devastating effect on the Empire's fighter
        capability.

     4) Recruit Alexandretta Sinan leader of the Free Nurses Resistance
        Front. Her help is vital if we are to liberate thisisland.

                                      -Page 124-

     HEMET

     Hemet is to the Imperial Guards Division what the pre-flood islandof
     Corsica was to the French Foreigh Legion. The island provides the
     Guards Division with a GHQ and a training ground. Your overall mission
     on this island is to destroy the fighting capability of the Imperial
     Guards Division and deprive the Empire of its most able troops.

     1) Assassinate Admiral Adam Robinson, the senior Imperial Naval
        strategist.

                                      -Page 125-

     CAJAMARCA

     Cajamaraca is a centre for watchmaking and manufacture of precision
     mechanisms. Because of these industries, industrial diamons are in great
     demand and smuggling is rife. One criminal activity has encouraged
     another and the island has become a haven for forgers. Cajamarca is
     famous for its bazaars where forged and smuggled goods are peddled.
     Little else can be said about thisisland - the secret police force is
     corrupt and there is a rather seedy down-at-heel medical college.
     Despite all this, the Federation is encouraging Cajamarca into the
     fold. Liberate the island.

     1) Enlist Captain Lufti Aal-Hamid. He is rotten to the core and
        supplements his ownincome by taking protection money off many of the
        islanders. He has the total respect of his own Police Force, most of
        whom are as corrupt as him, and his recruitment would be of great
        benefit to us.

     2) Enlist Bishop Donald Williamson, perhaps the most respected man on
        the island, although the military force on Cajamarca loathe him,
        because of his affinity with the island's Secret Police.

                                      -Page 126-

     NICOBAR

     Nicobar is a rich fertile island. Its Grand Harbour at Sweetwater is the
     busiest mercantile port in the whole Archipelago. At the mpment, it is
     also the chosen anchorage of Admiral Kreuter's Atlantic Fleet. Kreuter,
     the naval genius of our age, has a mountain retreat here, close to the
     village where his beloved mistress, Michelle Marchetta, lives.
     Kreuter's help is vital in liberating the island - his fleet is the
     best the Empire has and his men would follow him to the end of the
     earth. Authority and charm will help youon your mission.

     1) Enlist Admiral Kreuter. He is a proud, arrogant man, but he is also
        a gambler. You must find a way to gain his help. He has never been
        known to break his word.

     2) Assassinate Eric rainger, the General Secretary of the Dockworker's
        Union. The Secret Police pay Grainger large sums of money to keep
        the harbour workforce quiet and docile.

     3) Rescue Joseph Pearson, the pop singer, arrested by the Secret Police
        after the first performance of his protest song "Love is Freedom,
        Let's Fight For Love".

     4) Enlist Hugh Evans, President of the Union of Coal Miners. The Police
        have framed him on fraud charges and now he's in hiding. The miners
        will follow him to a man.

                                      -Page 127-

     ALMIRANTE

     Almirante is frequented by sailors and officers on leave from the
     Imperial Naval Base on Lobos. The island provides a wealth of leisure
     activities, ranging from hunting, fishing and minisub diving to
     ballooning and speedboat racing. The small offshore island of Pequeno
     is the start and finish point for the famous Captain Morgan's Cup, a
     speedboat race that circumnavigates Almirante. Less to the liking of
     the naval officers is the Secret Police Regional HQ at Forte . To
     ensure the navy's loyalty, the police keep detailed files on all the
     officers. If youcan seize these files, the way is open for mutiny.

     1) Enlist Captain Lobengula Youlou on Pequeno.

     2) Sabotage the Secret Police HQ at Forte Fields.

     3) Seize documents containing files on all the Imperial Military
        Officers stationed on Almirante.

     4) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Secundo Ocean, where Imperial gold
        reserves are stored.

     5) Assassinate General Edward White. He is loyal to the Empire, and in
        command of strong forces at Viano.

                                      -Page 128-

     AOSTA

     Aosta, sun drenched and idyllic, is the centre for the Saharan Empire
     movie-making industry. Two rival film studios are based on the island
     and the residents include many rich and famous film stars as well as
     a host of journalists and critics. The ubiquitos Secret Police maintain
     a quiet but a watchful presence on the island, ensuring that no liberal
     or republican propaganda find its way into the movies. Jealously and
     slander are a way of life on Aosta and youshould be careful about who
     you trust.

     1) Enlist Harold Lawrence, the renowned actor, whose loss to the Empire
        will be a huge blow to their morale.

     2) Enlist Christophe Schwabe the successful businessman, who produces
        all the enemy propaganda films. This will leave their film industry
        in ruins.

     3) Enlist Nandi Fabral, favourite pin-up of the Imperial troops. She
        has been portrayed to them as everything right in the Imperial woman.

     4) Sabotage the factory at Volcano Sister, used for film processing by
        the enemy.

     5) Sabotage the factory at Ocean Fields, used for film processing by the
        enemy.

                                      -Page 129-

     GALVA

     Far from the main tarde routes, Galva is a quiet and peaceful backwater.
     The Empire's flying sub factories are based in the north-west. In the
     south-east, a small group of scientists is engaged in rocket pack
     research. Galva is also the place of exile for the Emporer's over-
     ambitious nephew, Fasalis, who has a strong following in the army.
     Galva is unlikely to be a port of call for the Armada, but its rocket
     pack technology and the support of Fasalis would be extremely useful.
     Try charm and reason to win the islanders over to your cause.

     1) Enlist Lord Fasalis Moumie, the Emperor's overweening nephew. He
        loathes his uncle and will raise the banner of rebellion, rallying
        many men to our cause throughout the Slave Isles.

                                      -Page 130-

     ANDARA

     Andara is the home port of the Imperial Submarine Fleet and we know that
     there are atlease three underwater bases off the south-east coast. In
     the north-west of the island, the Empire is engaged in the highly
     advanced sonar research and manufacture, whilst further south, at
     Trovoadas, the Imperial Institute of Oceanography probes the depths of
     the ocean.
        Andara's major industry is aircraft production. A complex of slave
     camps at Asali provides labour for Adara's aircraft factories and for
     its abundant sugar plantations.

     1) Seize documents detailing Oceanography research. These are hidden in
        the Underwater Base at Salazoa.

     2) Destroy Captain Soromenho's Minisub squadron in the area around the
        Salazoa Underwater Base. This will enable the scientists there to
        escape.

     3) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Azul Water.

     4) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Primeiro Sea.

     5) Sabotage the Underwater Base at Esperance.

     6) Assassinate Colonel Kaduna Trudo, Commandant of the Army camp at
        Asali, with the objective of causing uprising and dissention there.

     7) Enlist Professor Andrea Hughes the Sonar Research Scientist at
        Fer-Sono.

                                      -Page 131-

     MAUR

     A huge barrage stretching across the island's western bay houses a tidal
     hydro-electric power station. The gigawatts of electricity generated
     there are used for experiments in fusion power. The Empire must not be
     allowed to progess in thisfield of research. The research staff are
     highly intelligent scientists, many of whom are also dissident authors.
     We must spread their work throughout the Empire.

     1) Enlist Touvalou Dube, the renowned Nobel prize winning Physicist.

     2) Sabotage the Electricity Works at King Point, at the northern end of
        the barrage.

                                      -Page 132-

     VICENZA

     Subsistence farming and coastal fishing are the mainstays of the local
     economy. Vicenza's unspoilt wilderness and clear skies have attracted
     three thriving communities of artists. The island is not heavily
     garrisoned, but early warning radars for the naval base on Lobos are
     stationed here. If we hold Vicenza, Lobos is blind. Fritsch, the Chief
     of Police is an avid collector of old masters and his help, together
     with the support of the island's more rebellious artists, will be vital
     to the liberation of Vicenza.

     1) Enlist Colonel Otto Fritsch, the art-loving Chief of Police. He is
        known to have some sympathy with our cause, but his price for
        helping us will be high, no doubt.

     2) Sabotage the Town Hall at Afonsin Plateau. The houses the censorship
        bureau which vets all the works of art produced on the island. Its
        destruction will win youmany friends.

     3) Enlist Audrey Sutton, leading light of the Maximalist Movement. Her
        support is vital in the liberation of Vicenza.

                                      -Page 133-

     CRISTOBAL

     The whole of Cristobal by the quisling tycoon, Lord Albert Harper, a
     hypochondriac recluse who fears contact with the rest of the island's
     population. The Imperial garrison shields Harper from the outside world
     and in return he regularly makes large donations to the Saharan Empire.
     The largest army presence here is at Wazir, in the north-east, where
     supplies and water are shipped out to other Saharan Islands to sustain
     troops. Cristobal is virtually a self-sufficient corporate island, with
     prosperous fisheries, farms, mines and abooming freshwater pearl
     diving industry.

     1) Assassinate Lord Harper, the tycoon owner of Cristobal.

     2) Enlist Dr. Josephine Hughes, Chairperson for the Council for Civil
        Liberties. She can be found working in the ghetto at Lambert, and
        will encourage the workers to revolt.

     3) Enlist the Governer Sambeka Bory, currently in the pay of Lord
        Harper. She is to be found in Colony. 

     4) Rescue Hazar Amin, radar research scientist, held against his will
        at Dry. He will be vital to the liberation of the island beause of
        his expertise in ECM, which he will use to 'blind' enemy units.

                                WEAPONS SYSTEMS
                                ---------------

     SNIPING RIFLE

     A long range anti-personnel weapon, ideally used for clandestine
     assassination attempts. Also effective against 'soft' airborne targets,
     but only mildly effective against land or sea based vehicles.

     DYNAMITE

     Sticks of high eplosive, detonated by a sixty second timed fuse, used
     for sabotaging and destroying buildings, vehicles or even people!
     Dynamite must be planted, (it cannot be used from within a vehicle) and
     you must ensure that you retire a safe distance within the time limit.
     When the explosives are detonated, a crater will be formed in the
     immediate vicinity of the explosion, and everything within its range
     will be destroyed. It is therefore only effective against stationary
     targets!

     PISTOL

     A short range anti-personnel weapon, deadly for close quarter
     assassination attemps, but hardly effective elsewhere.

     ROCKET LAUNCHER

     A multi-target seek-and-destroy weapon, comprising high-explosive packed
     warheads guided by laser system enhanced missiles fired from a portable
     launch unit. Highly effective against all targets except buildings.

                                      -Page 135-

     HAND GRENADE

     Short range high explosives thrown by hand and effective against all
     targets which are close by. The grenades must be carefully aimed and
     thrown sufficient distance so as not to harm the operative on
     detonation.

     GRENADE LAUNCHER

     Portable unit used for the firing of Hand Grenades, increasing
     effectiveness as it affords the grenades both greater range and
     accuracy.

     LIMPET MINE

     Effective against all stationary targets, especially underwater. Must be
     planted, like dynamite, with a sity second time delay allowing you
     escape time. Limpet mines will destroy all structures in the immediate
     vicinity, and will cause craters.

     ORCA MISSILE

     Laser system guided seek-and-destroy sea surface and sub aquatic
     missile, effective against most sea targets except buildings. The most
     effective 'water weapon'.

                                      -Page 136-

     KNIFE

     Used for close quarter hand to hand combat and assassinations.

     ASSAULT RIFLE

     A short range anti-personnel and anti light vehicle and aircraft weapon,
     firing high velocity bullets.

     SUBMACHINE GUN

     A short range anti-personnel rapid fire weapon effective in fire-fights
     and for assassinations.

     LIGHT MACHINE GUN


     A rapid fire anti-personnel weapon combining long range accuracy and
     light weight making it both effective and portable.

     HARPOON

     Designed for underwater use as a short range anti-personnel weapon.
     Semi-effective against other targets.

                                      -Page 137-

     HEAT-SEEKING MISSILE

     IR guided fire-and-forget homing missile, deadly against all targets
     except buildings and heavily armoured tanks.

     TANK SHELL

     Deadly when accurate, Tank Shells must be aimed carefully by both
     horizontal and vertical movements of the tank turret.

     UNDERWATER MISSILE

     A fire-and-forget homing missile effective against most sub-aquatic
     targets.

     TORPEDO

     An underwater missile which is deadly when accurate. Must be aimed
     carefully.

     TANK

     With a top speed of only 40 m.p.h., the Tank is one of the slowest and
     least manouverable of all vehicles. Its great strenghts lie in both its
     offensive firepower and defensive capabilities.
        High explosive Tank Shells are as destructive as any other weapon
     available. They are aimed by adjusting the tilt of the barrel, and the
     horizontal direction. At an angle of 45o, the range of the shell is at a
     maximum. Tanks are only highly vulnerable to other tanks shells - their
     thick armour plating resists virtually all else.

     JEEP

     Highly manouverable, nippy Jeeps will withstand some punishing driving.
     They will not however, stand up well to attack, leaving the driver more
     vulnerable to injury than any other land vehicle. They provide ideal
     transport for reconnaisance work. If youare expecting enemy company,
     look for something a little safer. Like all wheeled vehicles, jeep
     travel faster on roads than on crosscountry routes.

     TRUCK

     Trucks offer fairly safe, sturdy, reliable transport. They will not
     break any speed records, nor can they turn tightly, but they offer
     some degree of protection from small arms fire and ambush. They have
     limited off road capabilities, and will nearly always be seen
     travelling along roads.

     CRAWLER

     An ingenious vehicle designed to allow travel along the sea-bed and
     across land, the crawler provides a means of access to the many of the
     Underwater Bases you'll need to visit. Of average top speed and
     manouverability, the Crawler is hard to find, but easy to use.

     SUBMARINE

     Submarines offer you the best form of protection whilst underwater or on
     the sea surface. They can move forward and backwards, and right and
     left, and also have a facility for vertical movement without horizontal
     movement. Well armed and well defended, the only drawback is lack of
     speed and ease of manouverablity.

     MINISUB

     Complementing the abilities of a conventional submarine, the minisub is
     quick and manouverable, whilst being more vulnerable to attack. It can
     change vertical direction on the move, and is highly effective in
     underwater 'dogfights'.

     SHIP

     Ships, unlike Speedboats, are affected by wave movement, both pitching
     and yawing with the sea surface. It means that they are difficult to
     launch attack from, but are less likely to suffer damage from enemy
     attack.

     BIPLANE

     With the fundamental controls of any other plane, the Biplanes you'll
     encounter are also fitted with a special anti-stall mechanism which will
     not allow your speed to fall below 80 m.p.h. whilst you remain above 200
     feet. Below 200 feet you may slow normally for landing.

     HELICOPTER

     The Helicopters have full forward/backward, right/left and tilt
     controls, plus an ability for vertical ascent or descent at very slow
     speeds. This makes them very versatile, but also more difficult to fly
     than most. Practice will make perfect! Helicopters are well armed, but
     faily vulnerable.

     ZEPPELIN

     Like Helicopters, Zeppelins can effect vertical movement without
     horizontal movement, but by a different mechanism. They too have freedom
     of movement in all other directions, but are vulnerable to even the
     lightest firepower.

     BALLOON

     When piloting a balloon, you will not have 'direct' control of your
     transport. You can affect turn, tilt and vertical velocity, but not
     direction. For that you rely on windpower. Two rules govern such motion;
     a) the higher you are the faster you go, and b) at different altitudes
     the wind blows in a different direction. You may therefore alter speed
     and direction by altering altitude.

     ROCKET PACK

     The quickest and most manouverable form of transport available, the
     Rocket Pack is also the most difficult to control. Only found on the
     island of Galva, where there is a large Research Centre, speeds of up
     to 500 m.p.h. have been achieved in testing.

     FLYING BOAT

     Handling like a Biplane when airborne and as a Speedboat when on the

     Resistant to many forms of attack, it is at its best when itself
     attacking sea surface vessels.

     FLYING SUB

     The most adaptable mode of transport in the game, the flying sub can

     as youwill find.

     THE HUMAN MODES
     (ON FOOT, SWIMMING, PARACHUTING and FROGMAN)

     One of the four human modes of transport can always be accessed by
     pressing the ESC key. You will also transfer smoothly between human
     modes. If you walk towards the shore you will wade whilst remaining on
     foot for a while, then begin swimming, and eventually, when the water
     is deep enough, you'll be able to dive under the surface. Whilst in
     human mode youhave a high degree of freedom allowing you to explore
     the landscape, but you are very vulnerable to attack.
        To switch from swimming to frogman mode, you simply look down into
     the water whilst swimming and move forward.
        When parachuting, you have a small and constant forward speed. Using
     this in conjunction with your control over direction and vertical speed,
     you can usually steer yourself to a chosen spot.
        When walking, you can use your sniping rifle. Rifle sights appear on
     screen and you can zoom in or out using the cursor keys.

                    perform a rescue,murder, ambush or act of sabotage which

                    against the Armada.

     ENDURANCE      One of your five physical traits. Changing it alters
                    recuperation, and it governs the rate of depletion of
                    energy reserves.

     ENEMY UNIT     Each enemy unit comprises any number of vehicles, all of
                    one type, under the leadership of one Commander, by whose
                    name and rank the unit is identified. Each unit operates
                    individually; the loss of the majority of a unit may
                    lead the remainder of that unit to desert.

     ENERGY RESERVES  Your energy reserves represent your total stock of
                    energy, shown by the number of full running man icons
                    visible on the state of health display. It is converted
                    to muscle power when you rest briefly, and is itself
                    replenished by sustained rest.

     FIELD AGENTS   You are one of several Field Agents employed by COBRA. It
                    is your task to undertake the top secret missions as you
                    are one of the elite.

                    facilities, and perform all diskbased operations.

     HEALTH         Your body is divided into six areas, each of which may at
                    any time become injured. If they do, they become
                    overlayed by a red cross on your health diagram. If a
                    body area is damaged, movement may become restricted.
                    Time heals any injury, but the duration of convalescence
                    needed may vary from injury to injury.

                    all aspects of movement. They may change over time, for

     SAHARAN        The evil opponents of the Atlantic Federation, who run
     EMPIRE         the Slave Isles as dictatorships, and seek to do the
                    same to your home island of Agora. The Empire must be
                    destroyed if the East Atlantic is to be at peace.

     SECRET         A person may offer to take youto meet another person
     JOURNEY        whom is known to them, but whose whereabouts are to
                    remain secret. Typically such a person might be a high
                    ranking member of the local resistance whose life would
                    be endangered by anyone gaining knowledge of how to
                    find them.

     SECRET POLICE  The backbone of the Empire's tyrranical war machine, the
                    Secret Police terrorise the people of the Slave Isles on
                    day to day basis. If held by the Secret Police, expect

                    ruthless. The majority are.

     SETTLEMENT     A place of two buildings or more. Not all settlement
                    locations or names are knwon before a mission; those you

     SEX APPEAL     One of your eight psychological traits. Changing it
                    alters reason, and it is itself influensed by threats and
                    deception. Sex Appeal may only be used on a member of the
                    opposite sex.

     SHELTER        A person may offer to shelter youfrom the Saharan Forces
                    for a while, which is especially useful if the enemy are
                    in hot pursuit and you have limited resources at your
                    disposal.

     SKULL RATING   Each island mission has a skull rating associated with
                    it, indicating the level of difficulty of that mission.
                    Skull ratings are seen on the mission selector screen.

     SLAVE ISLES    The 42 islands of the East Atlantic archipelago.
                    Controlled by the Saharan Empire, who exploit the
                    populations relentlessly, the islands must be liberated
                    if Agora is to remain free.

     SPARE VEHICLE  An unclaimed item, available for use. Its position is
     WEAPON         known and indicated on the Main Map

                                      -Page 170-

                    an action is possible. They allow you to perform actions
                    without 'leaving' the 3-D landscape.

     STAMINA        One of your five physical traits. Changing it alter
                    reflexes, and it governs how quickly muscle power is
                    replenished.

     STRATEGIC      Allows you to make a precise simulation of the strategic
     PLANNING       part of a campaign without actually having to engage in
                    any action. Accessed via Training, or when choosing a new
                    island mission.

     STRONGHOLD     The Slave Isles of Dhafra, Lobos and Camargo, which
                    supply essential items to the other islands, or outposts.
                    The most strategically significant islands, whose
                    liberation will initiate the fall of others.

     STURDINESS     One of your five physical traits. Changing it alters
                    stamina, and it governs the rate of recovery from injury.

     SUPPLY ROUTES  The lines joining islands on the Strategic Planning and
                    Political Maps, showing routes along which supplies must
                    be brought to an outpost from a Saharan stronghold or the
                    mainland to continue to ensure that the island remains
                    enslaved. By cutting the lines you can force the
                    liberation of an island without performing its mission.

     THREATS        One of your eight psychological traits. Changing it
                    alters charm, sex appeal and reason, and it is itself
                    influenced by pleading.

     TRAINING       Offers you the chance to practise any aspects of the game
     DEPARTMENT     in isolation; Strategic Planning, Escape Training,
                    Training on any mode of transport, or to Firefight.

     TRAITOR        An inhabitant of the Slave Isles who conspires with the
                    Saharans and will betray you to them. They behave as
                    normal until the time comes when you would usually be
                    offered help. Then they turn you in. Returning to a
                    Traitor after they have betrayed you will prove
                    profitable!

     TRANSPORT      There are 22 modes of transport, including the human
                    modes, available to

                                      -Page 171-

                    you. Some are rarer than others. You may be given
                    transport at the start of the mission, or offered it by
                    a person you meet. you can also 'leap' into any vehicle
                    via Special Actions.

     TREATMENT      A person may offer you medical assistance. The person's
                    medical skills will vary from poor, through average and
                    good, to excellent. Each level of skill will allow them
                    to repair one damaged body part in a session.

     VITAL          You may be asked to find or seize documents as a mission
     DOCUMENTS      objective or condition of help. They can be foud in a
                    Weapons box somewhere on the island, or may be given to
                    you by a contact or recruit.

     WAR ROOM       The COBRA Department in which all disk based operations
                    are performed; creating campaign disks, backing up
                    originals, and loading and saving existing campaigns.

     WAYMARKER      The point where an Autoroute changes direction, plotted
                    on the Main Map. Allows complicated pathways to be
                    plotted.

     WEAPONS BOX    Hold objects which may be 'grabbed' via Special Actions
                    in the 3-D landscape. Contents can only be found by
                    grabbing. Usually weapons, but may be vital documents or
                    even a booby trap.

     WEAPONS        There are over a dozen weapons systems for your use. Some
     SYSTEM         will be given to you, others you will find. Each system
                    has its own handling characteristics, and effectiveness
                    against a range of targets.

                                DIRECTOR's NOTES
                                ----------------

     I don't know at what stage you've got around reading this - whether
     you've just unwrapped the cellophane from the box and let the manual
     fall open at this page or whether you've been playing the game for
     weeks before noticing thisbrief epistle. Whichever is the case, I hope
     that Flames of Freedom gives youmany hours of entertainment
        From the outset, Flames of Freedom was designed to offer youa
     single, massive challenge where all the skills youhave learnt during
     individual missions mesh together in a grand finale. At each level of
     play, your decisions and actions don't just bring youa higher score,
     they directly influence the course of events at a higher level.
        Winning a dogfight, for instance, can be fun in itself but youmight
     have destroyed the last plane in an enemy squadron. Then, it turns out,
     destroying the biplane squadron enables youto recruit a scientist -
     the last of your mission objectives. The islandis liberated and enemy
     supply lines are cut. As a result, two other islands are liberated,
     blocking the route of the Saharan Armada. This makes a crucial
     difference when the Armada sets sail and instead of having defeat 15
     Battle Groups, you only have to deal with a handful. As a consequence,
     youend up winning instead of losing!
        At the same time, we've tried to weave as much excitement and drama
     into the game as possible. As youdash about on your mission, the story
     begins to unfold around you. You learn of other people. You find out
     what makes them tick. You try to win their hearts and minds. You deal
     with trachery and deceit whilst, all the time, danger shadows you.
        Breathing life into the complex world of Flames of Freedom has been
     a fascinating but arduous task. All the programmers and artists at
     Maelstrom have given 110% effort. On the publishing side, MicroProse
     have shown commendable patience and given much valuable help and
     encouragement. It only remains to say that everyone involved in the
     project hopes that you enjoy the game and thanks for buying it!

             Mike Singleton.
