GENERAL TIPS
------------

 The first aspects of the game you should master are the Joystick 
controls.  The highly interactive nature of the game is required
because of some of the complex moves the main character has to
perform.  A high level of competence at the controls will enhance
your game play CONSIDERABLY.

 Because of the adventure elements, our second suggestion is that
you should get into the habit of RECORDING what happens on each
screen.  This will enable you to obtain Higher Scores with repeated
play.

 The last point is, NEVER TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED, some things
are not as they appear.  Be curious and nosey, examine everything

  In the spirit of all adventures...WE HAVE NOT TOLD YOU THE WHOLE STORY

PLAYING GUIDE TO LEVEL ONE
--------------------------

 If you are experiencing any difficulty on getting into the style of
play needed in this game the following details outline all the puzzles
and objects you encounter in the first level and should help you master
the rest of the game.

1. Kill harpies (small green flying dragons) throughout the game which
   drop EXTRA ENERGY and valuable FIREBALLS.

2. Use fireballs to kill skeletons until on of them drops a SWORD.

3. Use the sword with various moves shown in "JOYSTICK CONTROLS" to
   fight your way deeper into the game.  CUT DOWN HANGING SKELETON.

4. Make your way down to the bottom of the cavern where the now freed
   skeleton has to be killed and his skull must fall into flames.

5. A DEMON then rises from the flames and can only be destroyed with 
   FIREBALLS.

6. Pick up demon's TRIDENT for use later in the game.  Note-The trident
   is only one shot so care must be taken to use it wisely.

7. Make your way to the top right in the cavern where you will be
   confronted by the chimera (a three headed demon).  This can only
   be killed by using the TRIDENT and it is advisable that the trident
   is already selected just before you confront the CHIMERA.

8. Continue your adventure by slaying enemies with the sword until you
   reach the feminine NYMPH.  Approach her ONLY when she beckons or when
   her hand is flat.  Be very cautious and once close enough, KNEEL down
   this changes the nymph into an extra energy bead, vital for later
   stages of the game.

   Note:- When she holdsher hand up in fromt of you, move back again 
          until she beckoned you to try again and move in.

9. On reaching the ACHILLES statue, attack the HEEL with either fireballs
   or sword and this will eventually cause ACHILLES to crumble, leaving
   only his SHIELD which when picked up, allows you to run past all
   remaining enemies at this particular stage.

10.At this stage of the level, extra care must be taken with the joystick
   controls.  Once these are nmastered gameplay should become easier.
   MEDUSA is around here, and her EYE BOLTS are lethal and will turn you
   to stone.  Make sure you have selected the SHIELD prior to running
   into MEDUSA and then use it carefully to deflect her eye bolts as you
   make your way across the platforms to stand alongside her.

   Note:-The shield must be RAISED to deflect her shots, not just held.

11.When she looks away, quickly select SWORD and attack her neck.

12.Pick up the MEDUSA HEAD to use in your final confrontation on this
   level.  The hugh three headed HYDRA stands between you and level two
   Use MEDUSA'S HEAD in conjunction with the FIRE BUTTON and attack
   each HYDRA head individually.  On destroying the HYDRA, level one is
   complete and you should now be capable of confidentally tackling the
   ever increasing hazards that will now greet your every turn throughout
   the rest of the game GOOD LUCK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.
