 - fixed jump option with a helmet on one of the 2 PAL versions
 - added option to start on a given world (4 different worlds)
 - added option to use simplified level codes (only for US/NTSC version)
   level codes are 00<world><level>,so:

 - CUSTOM1 enables cheat keys, see below

 version 2.2 (09.05.2014) done by JOTD:
 - reworked installed script (hoping to fix issue #2996)
 - added 'S' trainer key to get gold coin / gold star and increase number
   of silver stars (same as 'T' but you get other weapons than teleport)
   (too many presses => buggy/trashed gfx bonus)

 - Use 'T' key to get gold coin / gold star (and reach the secret warp everytime !)
 - Docs/walkthrough/level codes for US version provided
 - Nice icons by Frank/Exoticons

NOTES:

- This game needed NOVBRMOVE because I could not fix the copylock. I was almost
  there, but it still crashed at some point. I asked help to Codetapper who
  went very close, but could not do it either. Finally Galahad gave the final
  blow to the protection, one of the toughest copylocks ever IHMO.

- Install should work with cracked versions, but it is not guaranteed.

- I asked to Bitmap Bros if they could give the game for free (i.e. allow
  the game to be put on legal sites) but they refused. Too bad.

- there are several issues (I may fix them in the future):
  - when entering a wrong level code in an underwater level of world 3, the helmet
    goes away and you die...
  - On WinUAE, fast setting, the bike can only go right, not left !!
  
KEYS:

P    : pause
Q    : quit game & return to level 1
F2   : enter level code (US/NTSC version)

Controls with 2nd controls:

2nd button jumps. Up is still active when using diving helmet or bubble gum machine

Cheat keys:

HELP : levelskip (kill at least 1 monster to get the levelcode)
T    : next token is a coin, 1 silver star owned
S    : next token is a coin, silver star owned++
F    : fly mode (bubble doesn't appear but effect is the same)

Don't forget to set the tooltype to NTSC if you run the game from a PAL machine or
the music will be jerky.


A walkthrough is provided. It explains the tricks to reach secret rooms and more.
It has been greatly enhanced by dELTA tX and recently by me

Custom world 1 was re-created by JOTD using a custom level editor.
It is possible to enable it only with NTSC/US version
