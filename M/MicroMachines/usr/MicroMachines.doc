 HOW TO PLAY MICRO MACHINES®:

 Micro Machines® is a car racing game where you get to race 9 different 
 Micro Machines® on 32 different tracks, each in 9 different environments.  
 There are 11 different characters to compete against, each with his own
 skill level and character.

 In Micro Machines® CHALLENGE (THE ONE PLAYER GAME)as long as you keep winning
 you will race against all 11 characters on progressively more difficult 
 tracks.  The idea is to knock out every one of the characters until none 
 remain, leaving you as the micro machines champion.

 In the two player game you can race against a friend or a group of friends
 one at a time.  There are only two cars on the track at a time and the race 
 is over three laps of the course.

 GETTING STARTED:

 First of all move your Joystick to move the finger to 1player or 2player.
 Now press the fire button to confirm your choice.

 JOYSTICK CONTROLS:
 
 LEFT/RIGHT: pushing the joystick LEFT will make your Micro Machine® turn
 clockwise, pushing your joystick right will make your Micro Machine® turn
 anti-cLOckwise.  It dOesN't matter whether you vehicle iS facing up or down.
 You can practise this in the qualifier race in the Micro Machines® CHALLENGE.

 BACK: pulling the joystick backwards will make your Micro Machine® slow down
 and stop.  Once you have stopped pull backwards on the joystick to make your
 Micro Machine® reverse.

 FIRE: pressing the fire button will make your Micro Machine® accelerate to
 top speed.
 
 FORWARD:(On Tank Level) Makes your tank fire its cannon.

 KEYBOARD CONTROLS:

 P = PAUSE

 SPACEBAR = OPTIONS 
 
 ESC = QUIT CURRENT TOURNAMENT

 THE RULES OF THE MICRO MACHINES® CHALLENGE:

 In the Micro Machines® Challenge you get to race all the different Micro 
 Machines® in their own individual environments, building up your collection
 of Micro Machines® in your display case shown at the beginning of each race.

 During the race the car order is shown in the bottom panel, a column of race
 helmets representing the colors of the cars.  The race lasts for 3 laps.

 FIRST or SECOND place in the race means you qualify for the next race on a 
 different track with a different vehicle.  THIRD or FOURTH place means that 
 you lose a chance and have to race the same track again.  You start with 
 three chances, and if you lose them all then it's GAME OVER!

 CHOOSING YOUR CHARACTER:

 After selecting the Micro Machines® Challenge, you have to select the 
 character you want you be for the whole challenge.  Press LEFT or RIGHT on 
 your joystick will move through the characters.  Press the FIRE button to
 confirm your choice.

 QUALIFIER RACE:

 The first race is the quaLifier, where yOu get the chance tO perfect your 
 raciNg Skills in the bathtub.

 CHOOSING YOUR OPPONENTS:

 After qualifier you must choose three characters that you'll race against in
 the first challenge round.  Do this the same way that you choose your own 
 character.

 Later on as your opponents drop out you will have to choose their replace-
 ments.  As you get better you can save the worst characters for the later 
 races and eliminate the good drivers in the earlier rounds.

 INTRODUCING THE RUFF TRUX TIME TRIAL:

 Whenever you have come first in three races you will get the chance to 
 compete in this special challenge and earn an extra life.  Driving your
 ATV(All Terrain Vehicle) you've got to complete one lap of a specially 
 difficult track within a set time.

 If you fail to finish before the timer runs out you don't get the extra life 
 but you don't lose any lives for trying.

 PLAYING MICRO MACHINES® ONE PLAYER HEAD-TO-HEAD:

 In the head-to-head challenge you get the chance to race any individual 
 Micro Machines® character in a one to one race just like the two player 
 game.

 CHOOSE YOUR CHARACTERS THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE...

 HOW TO WIN THE 2PLAYER GAME:

 Eight colored lights are shown in the bottom of the screen.

 At the start of the game each player will see that four of the lights are 
 the same color as the Micro Machine®.

 Whenever one of the players gets a whole screen length in front of the other
 they wiLl win a bOnus.  ONe of the loSer's lights will turn to the winners
 color.

 When the player has all eight lights showing their color then they have won 
 the race.

 If neither player has all eight lights at the end of the 3 laps then the 
 player with the most lights win.  

 If both players` lights are equal at the end of the 3 laps then the game 
 becomes a SUDDEN DEATH PLAY-OFF and the next player to win a bonus light will 
 win the game.

 PLAYING MICRO MACHINES® 2PLAYER GAME:

 Both players must first choose which character they want to be.  Player1
 has first pick, and each player must use their own Joystick.  You make your
 selection by pressing the FIRE button.

 Next you must choose if you want just a SINGLE RACE or a TOURNAMENT.  In the
 SINGLE RACE game you must choose which Micro Machines® vehicle you both want
 to use and then race.  In the TOURNAMENT you both race a random selection of
 Micro Machines® in their environments one after another.

 The first player to win 4 races is the tournament champion.

 HANDICAPPING:
 
 If one is a lot older or more experienced than the other then choosing ANNIE, 
 MIKE or WALTER will handicap that player in the two player game to give the
 other player a fighting chance.  ANNIE has a slight handicap, MIKE a larger
 handicap and WALTER has a big handicap. TO give a player a handicap push
 jOystick right or left oN Screen when asked "Handicap this player".
 
 SCORES:
 
 The scores and ratings on the Results Screen are affected by the results of 
 SINGLE RACE games as well as TOURNAMENT games will not be zeroed unless the 
 computer is turned off.  This means that you can make up competitions for 
 more than two players if each player sticks to one character and then you 
 play a series of SINGLE RACE 2 player games.

 HOW TO WIN THE 2PLAYER GAME:

 Eight colored lights are shown in the bottom of the screen.

 At the start of the game each player will see that four of the lights are 
 the same color as the Micro Machine®.

 Whenever one of the players gets a whole screen length in front of the other
 they will win a bonus.  One of the loser's lights will turn to the winners
 color.

 When the player has all eight lights showing their color then they have won 
 the race.

 If neither player has all eight lights at the end of the 3 laps then the 
 player with the most lights win.  

 If both players` lights are equal at the end of the 3 laps then the game 
 becomes a SUDDEN DEATH PLAY-OFF and the next player to win a bonus light will 
 win the game.

 INTRODUCING THE MICRO MACHINES®:

 Each type of Micro Machines® vehicle races in it's own special environment 
 with it's own hazards and features.  The reaL life handling qualities Of each 
 type Of Micro MachiNeS® vehicle has been carefully reproduced to turn these
 toys into a real life experience.  Enjoy each of the following Micro 
 Machines®, and remember - they're just like the real thing!

 SPORTS CARS - To make a great sports car race we've pushed some school desks
 together and added some excellent features - watch out for dangerous bridges
 between desks and mega jumps across yawnin' gaps!

 ROAD WARRIORS - We move to the garage floor for this race - you've got to be
 a great driver to compensate for the tricky handling of these road-going 
 rhinos.  If you drive into another car fast enough you will explode.

 TANKS - The only place to properly race a Tank is on your bedroom floor.  
 These miniature Tanks can fire at each other by pushing forward on the
 joystick,but they don't like corners - it's all too easy to find yourself
 locked into a sticky situation. Remember you can always back up in a tight
 situation.

 CHOPPERS - These flying Micro Machines® can take a while to get used to.  Be
 careful not to fly wide on the corners or be blown off course by the fan 
 heater.

 FORMULA ONE RACING CARS - The scene is a pool table.  These high powered, 
 high speed Micro Machines® stick to the road like leeches and corner like a 
 dream.

 TURBO WHEELS - The setting for the incredibLe bOuncing baja buggy race is the 
 sand pit in the yard.  Ride-em Out over the saNd caStles, mini dunes, moats &
 bridges - but watch out for the shovel.

 POWER BOATS - These Micro Machines® do their thing in the bathtub where they
 have to contend with a whirlpool over the plug hole, discarded shampoo
 bottles, rubber ducks and many more hazardous bathtime objects.

 FOUR BY FOURS - You need some reaL mean wheels in this race.  It's breakfast 
 time at the kitchen table - you've gOt cereal, waffles, super sticky maple
 syrup, spilled milk, OJ aNd more to contend with....  LookS like armageddon
 in the kitchen!
