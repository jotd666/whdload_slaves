 This install applies to "Master Axe" © 1994 Epic.
 
 This installer was originally done by me (as JST) on request from Epic Marketing.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 It can be quit by pressing right amiga key
 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=" but with that game it's not
  easy to find something that's not used).

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 2.0 MB OtherMem. It doesn't use
 the AGA chipset features, despite being sold as AGA. But the numerous animations
 probably call for 1.5 MB chipmem. So any amiga with 2MB chip can run it.
 
 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de
