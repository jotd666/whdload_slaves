               -Includes all Babalities, Fatalities and    
                Friendships + additional secrets for only  
                one-button joystick players (Amiga version)

Here is the mostly-completed list of finishing moves for the Amiga version
of Mortal Kombat II.  Keep in mind these all assume you are playing with a
one-button joystick.  If you are using a 2-button joystick, your moves may
be slightly different. (Found in TRD's doc release) If I have forgotten
anything, or you have a correction, send me Email and let me know.
All the moves below have been personally verified, unless otherwise noted.

A note from pATRiCiAn:
I've melted all the three docs (nn-mk2sm.txt, trd-mort.txt + Brett's msg)
in this same file for much easier access and using, hope you still aren't
too fed up with the game and have some use for this...
And thanks to dHM / Complex + fAtWA for the nice dTL logo ;)

Wait until the face pops out in the lower right corner and
says "Toasty!".  The face will appear when you uppercut your opponent,
or your opponent uppercuts you.  There is no determined way to get the
face to appear more frequently.  It can appear a few times during a
match or not at all.

As soon as the face appears, press the following simultaneously:
Fire+Down+Left.  This movement is not dependent on the direction you face.
Whoever presses their start button first will be the one who will fight
Smoke.
