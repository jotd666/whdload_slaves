This patch applies to "Mortal Kombat 2" (c) 1994 Acclaim - 3/4 disks.
Thanks to Carlo Pirri and Mad-Matt for the 3 disk version and Chris
Vella for the 4 disk US version!

REQUIREMENTS:
- Slave requires WHDLoad V17+.
- 1MB chip slave requires 1Mb chip mem/1.5Mb fast mem (+2.9Mb other memory for preload option)
- 512k chip slave requires 512k chip mem/2Mb fast mem (+2.9Mb other memory for preload option)

FEATURES:
- Full load from HD
- 2 versions supported
- RNC copylock removed (x2)
- Decruncher relocated to fast memory
- Slaves included for both 512k and 1Mb chip machines (more speech/effects)
- Snoop bug removed (move.b #0,$bfd200)
- Colour bit fix
- Instructions included (including summary of all moves)
- RomIcon, NewIcon and GlowIcon (created by me!)
- Quit option (default key is 'F10')

CHEAT MODE:
- Taken from Sweet Cheater by Keith Krellwitz and Codetapper!
- On the screen where you can select between {START} and {OPTIONS},
  type "FIONA".  The screen will flash green.  This turns off the
  blood.  To reactivate the blood type it again and the screen will
  flash red.
- Select options from that same screen and type "ZEDWEB".  A new
  option (DIAGNOSTICS) should appear at the bottom of the screen.
  Select this option and you will be given a list of cheat options.
  Note that the above code assumes a French keymap is used, for
  most English speaking countries type in "WEDZEB" to activate the
  cheat. For German keyboards, type "YEDWEB".

Previous memory configuration info:

If you have 2Mb of chip memory you should run the AGA version of the game
(it doesn't require the AGA chipset but all AGA machines have 2Mb chip so I
named it that!) as you will get a lot more speech and effects in most parts
of the game.  If you do not have enough memory to preload all images and
play the AGA version, simply use the normal slave to save some memory.

BUT:

The game really detects 512k chip or 1MB chip. The rest of the memory can be
fast memory, it doesn't matter. For some reason, the memory needs to be
aligned on 0.5mb boundary which explains that it requires more fastmem than
it should.
It also used to detect 32 bit memory and act weird, where there's no reason
for that, so I disabled that test.

GREETINGS TO:
- Mr Larmer for his assistance on the nasty copylock (and for the 
  magnificent copylock decoder)
- Mick for his JST source
- Jean-François Fabre for patching the original from the Prestige crack
  all those years ago
- Bert Jahn for constantly updating WHDLoad 
- Galahad/Fairlight for constant assistance :)
- The rest of the WHDLoad team (Bored Seal, Harry, Psygore)
- Frank for the French lessons, testing and superb icons
- And my great original suppliers Carlo, Chris and Mad-Matt!

Enjoy this superb game on HD and put those floppies away for good!
