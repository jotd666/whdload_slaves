Contents                                 

Your M1 Tank Platoon should contain a manual, this technical supplement, a
3.5" disk, keyboard overlays and a registration card.

Equipment

This simulation requires a Commodore Amiga with at least 512K of memory. It
runs faster on machines with 1 Megabyte (1M) of memory. You can play this
simulation entirely with the mouse, but many "tankers" find the keyboard
useful at points. A joystick is also supported for certain tasks.
512K Memory Machines: If your machine has only 512K of RAM (memory), M1
Tank Platoon requires that you use only one 800K 3.5" floppy drive. You must
unplug all other drives. If you leave additional drives connected, the 
operating system leaves M1 Tank Platoon with insufficient memory.

Saving Games

The game program disk has sufficient room to save all your platoon records.
You do not need a separate save-game disk.

Installation

M1 Tank Platoon is not copy-protected. It can be copied to other disks. If 
you copy it into a hard disk, make sure everything is in the same drawer.
Always play from a copy, never from your original.
You can only make copies of the disk for your own, personal use. Selling or
giving away any copies of M1 Tank Platoon is a Copyright Violation and against
the law. See the copyright notice at the end of the game manual.

Loading

M1 Tank Platoon can be loaded from the Workbench by double-clicking on the M1
Tank Platoon icon, like any other program.
In addition, you can auto-load the simulation by turning off your computer,
inserting the M1 Tank Platoon disk, then turning on your computer. (Exception:
if you have an Amiga 1000 that requires a Kickstart disk, you must use that
disk first, then insert M1 Tank Platoon when the computer asks for the
Workbench disk.)
If playing from floppy disks, leave the disk in your drive throughout the
game. Do not remove the disk until you quit the game.

Operating Problems

The latest notes regarding this program can be found on the disk in a file
named "READ.ME"
If the program does not load or run correctly, turn off your computer and 
restart it. On a 512K machine, make sure only ONE floppy disk drive is
attached. Also remove any other peripheral hardware. If you still have
trouble, make a new copy of the game on another Amiga and try it on that. If
the copy works on that machine, but not your own, your machine has hardware
problems. Take it to a dealer or service facility for examination. A common
problem is disk drives falling out of alignment.
If you have trouble loading on other Amigas as well as your own, you may be
one of the tiny percentage with a defective disk. In such cases contact
MicroProse Customer Service at (301) 771-1151, Monday through Friday, 
9AM-5PM, Eastern time. Please have a pencil and paper handy when you call.

MOUSE CONTROLS

The Amiga version of M1 Tank Platoon fully supports mouse operations in the
Amiga style. This means significant changes from the IBM system described in
the manual. For example, mouse actions are activated by the left-side mouse
button (a "left-click"), while holding down the right-side mouse button brings
up menus (a "right-holddown").
All options outside battle are mouse operated. The keyboard is used only to
erase and reenter names. The joystick is not used outside of battle.
During battle keyboard, mouse and joystick are supported. You can use the
keyboard controls and overlay as described in the manual, or the mouse
controls as described below, or any combination that suits you. In battle the
joystick emulates the keyboard's cursor keys (the controller).

Prepare for Battle

You must use a mouse for all these controls. Ignore the manual references to
Controllers and Selectors. Instead use the mouse to find and move the
highlight, and then left-click to make a choice. In addition, some screens
have yellow buttons. Click on these to perform various actions.
Staff Briefings (page 31-35): As you move the mouse, a selected option
highlights. Left-click to make your selection.
On the very first briefing page, where the platoons are listed, you can start
a new platoon by pressing the Esc key, typing a new name, and pressing Return.
This erases the old platoon and creates an entirely new one.
Vehicle Identification Quiz (page 33): As in the briefing, use the mouse to
highlight and left-click to make your choice.
Bivouac-Outfitting (page 35-36): You can highlighy the text areas in the top
half of the screen. Left-click on your platoon name, a vehicle name, a
crewman's name, or ammo supply. In each case you'll see detailed information
on the bottom half of the screen.
To transfer a crewman to another position (either in that tank or another 
tank), click on the man's name, click on the "XFER" button, then click on the
position he'll occupy. Illegal positions (see the lower box on page 36) will
not highlight.
To promote or decorate a crewman after a battle, simply click on his name and
press the appropriate button. A man's current rank and task may prevent
promotion (see the lower box on page 36).
You can change a crewman's name by clicking on it, pressing ESC, typing a new
name, and pressing Return. This permanently changes that name with the new one
(you'll never see that old name again!).
Bivouac-Briefing (page 36): Although the briefing is automatic, you can "speed
read" through it using the yellow buttons. "PREV" sends your back to the 
previous page, "NEXT" to the next page, and "EXIT" to the bivouac options.

Battle Controls Overview

Controllers: The "controller" swings your view left or right, elevates it up 
or moves it down. You can use the joystick, cursor keys, and/or mouse as the
"controller". Each operates somewhat differently; select the method(s) you
prefer.
Mouse Controller: In crew positions (TC, Gunner or Driver), use the mouse to
manipulate the device illustrated on page 40. The mouse moves the small
"Controller Position" boxes like "slider" switches along their respective
tracks (the left-right horizontal track, and the up-down vertical track).
To move the box, left-holddown on the box, wait until it changes color, then
drag it along the slider. The further you drag it, the faster the movement.
When you release the mouse button, the slider jumps back to center position
(the slider is "spring loaded").
For small movements, you can "left-click" along the slider beside the box.
This produces very slow movement as long as you hold down the mouse button.
When you release it the movement stops.
Joystick Controller: Holding the joystick left, right, up or down causes
accelerating movement in that direction. To move slowly, flick or tap the
joystick repeatedly. Movement stops when you release (center) the stick.
Cursor Controller: One tap of a cursor key starts movement very slowly in a
direction. Repeated taps, or holding the key down, accelerates the movement.
To stop movement, tap once in the opposite direction. You can use both the
special cursor keys and the direction keys on the numeric keypad.
Up and Down: Unlike the IBM version, the "up" button or control position 
device moves your aim upward, while "down" moves it downward.
The Pop-Up Menu: During battle a right-holddown with the mouse pops up a
general-purpose menu. This menu lets you change viewpoints, your OP (personal
location) and leaders. These options are described in more detail on page 37
and pages 66-67. The menu options duplicate certain function keys.
Selector #1: Frequently referenced in the manual, this is always the Return 
key or the Joystick fire button.
Selector #2: Also referenced in the manual, this is always the Space bar. 
There is no joystick equivalent.

TC Unbuttoned View

This view is illustrated on page 39 of the manual. As shown there, a mouse
left-click in the appropriate area fires a Smoke Grenade Launcher.
The Controller: Moving the controller left or right (with the mouse, joystick,
or cursor keys) swings the TC's cupola that direction, including his machine-
gun. Moving the controller up or down elevates or depresses your view and the
gun.
Firing: To fire the caliber .50 M2HB machine-gun, left-click on either handle,
or the area between them. A single click fires a short burst. Hold it down for
sustained fire.
Zoom/Unzoon: To use your 7x35 binoculars, left-click anywhere in the outside
view. To remove them, left-click again in the same area.
New Controls: There is a new switch, not illustrated in the manual, to the 
right of the Round-Loaded and Laser Warning lights. This switch toggles on/off
the image intensifiers (a night vision aid) in your binoculars. Obviously, if
you aren't using the binoculars this switch has no effect!

TC Buttoned View

This view is illustrated on page 41. A mouse left-click in the appropriate 
area fires a Smoke Grenade Launcher. In addition, left-clicking on the 
Ammunition Switch or the Main-Coax Switch instructs the gunner to change ammo
or weapon types. The other switches and lights are informational only. To 
operate them you must move to the gunner's position.
The Controller: Performs the same function here as the TC Unbuttoned View
(above).
Firing: AS in the real M1A1, you an fire the TC's caliber .50 M2HB machine-gun
with the hatch closed. Left-click on the small handgrip to the far right, just
below the vision slot. As before, a single click fires a burst, holding down
the button produces sustained fire.
Zoom/Unzoom: The TC can toggle between 1x (normal) and 3x (zoom) vision. To
do this, left-click anywhere in the vision slot view.
Night Vision: When buttoned up the TC has no night vision aids. The thermal
viewer is only available to the gunner, not the TC. (The US Army is aware of
this limitation and has proposed additional night-vision aids for future
versions of the M1.)

Gunner View

This view is illustrated on page 43 of the manual. A left-click in the 
appropriate area operates each of these controls: Smoke Grenade Launchers,
Thermal (night) Viewer Switch, Computer (Norm)/Battlesight Switch, Main-Coax
Switch, Ammunition Switch, and the Magnification Lever.
The Controller: Moving the controller left or right (with the mouse, joystick,
or cursor keys) rotates the turret and your viewpoint. Moving the controller
up or down elevates or depresses the main gun, the coaxial machine-gun and 
your view.
Firing Laser or Gun: The Gunner Controls Handgrip buttons are "clickable" with
the mouse. The LEFT button fires the laser rangefinder once. The RIGHT button
fires the gun. If the gun is set to "main", the 120mm cannon fires one round
and the loader immediately begins reloading. If the gun is set to "coax", the
coaxial machine-gun either fires a burst (with a click), or gives sustained
fire (if you hold down the mouse button).
Zoom/Unzoom: To toggle between the 3x and 10x views available to the gunner,
either left-click in the view area, or on the Magnification Lever.
Gun Stabilization: Whenever your laser strikes a target (i.e., any vehicle or
ground troops), the turret stabilization system is automatically engaged. From
that moment onward, the turret automatically rotates, elevates, or depresses
to keep the weapon aimed at the target, regardless of either your movement or
the target's movement. An "*" appears in your gunsight after the range when
your stabilization is running.
Stabilization is very handy. You just "zap" the target with the laser, then 
sit back and watch the weapon track the target. If you don't fire soon, it's 
wise you occasionally update the range with another laser flash.
If you move the controller, the stabilization turns off. If you leave the 
gunner's position, the actual crewman takes over and makes his own target
selection (which may not match yours!).

Driver View

This view is illustrated on page 47. As shown there, a mouse left-click
operates the Engine Exhaust Smoke Generator, the Night Periscope, and the
Brake Pedal. The Parking Brake (the smaller pedal) is not used during battle,
and is therefore inactive. 
The Controller: Moving the controller left or right (with the mouse, joystick,
or cursor keys) turns the hull in that direction. Moving the controller up
causes the tank to accelerate forward. Moving the controller back causes the
tank to slow down; if the tank is already halted and you move the controller
back, the tank moves in revers.
Firing: The driver has no weapons, and therefore cannot fire. The joystick 
fire button or the Return key apply the brakes. Remember that because of your
viewing angle, the brakes are off when the pedal is down, and applied when the
pedal is up.
Zoom/Unzoom: The driver has no zoom viewer. His vision slot is always 1x
(normal) power.
New Controls: The driver's handgrips in the M1 operate like motorcycle 
controls. Rotating them controls vehicle acceleration. For convenience, a 
mouse left-click on either handgrip immediately "puts the pedal to the metal",
accelerating the vehicle to maximum speed as fast as possible. The tank 
continues at maximum speed until you use the brakes.
Driving Notes: The mouse and joystick controls recenter when you release them,
causing the tank to coast to a stop. The cursor keys do not. Therefore, you
may find it convenient to accelerate to speed with the cursor keys, then steer
with the joystick or mouse.

The Mapboard

The mapboard is illustrated on page 56. All keyboard controls for the mapboard
work as described in the manual. Function keys F5, F6, F7 and F8 navigate 
through all mapboard options, and the regular alphabetic keys to issue orders.
In addition, you can use the mouse for a different and more intuitive control
of the map.
Mapboard Area: In the map area to the left, left-click to move the crosshairs
to any part of the map. To zoom or unzoom either use the keyboard "z" and "x"
keys, or move to the right and click on the "Z-zoom" or "X-unzoom" text in the
lower right corner. 
If you left-click on top of a unit on the map, in addition to putting the
crosshairs there, you also see the data window for that unit.
Manual references to "move to" and "turn to" orders (pg 13, 57, 59, 62) are
inaccurate because of the new mouse controls. The "m" and "t" keys are now 
used for these orders.
Data Window: The data-window (to the right of the map) operates on three 
levels of detail. The highest shows you a map key. To go to a friendly 
platoon, left-click anywhere in the list of US forces. You'll drop down to the
data for your first platoon (your MBT platoon of M1/M1A1 tanks).
The next highest level is platoon data, with a gray background. Left-click in
the upper left corner (on the vehicle symbol) to return to the map key. Left-
click on the platoon name across the top to go to the next platoon. Left-click
on an individual platoon vehicle to see a specific vehicle.
The lowest level shows information about a specific vehicle in a platoon (with
a white background). Again, left-click in the upper left corner (on the 
symbol) to move up to platoon data. Left-click on the vehicle's name (across
the top) to see the next vehicle in that platoon. For tanks in your platoon,
left-click on a crewman to go to that position (which exits the map). Note
that whenever you left-click to go to a crew position, your OP (observation
point) is automatically transferred to that tank (see page 66 for details on
your OP).
On both the platoon (middle) and vehicle (lowest) levels you can issue orders
to the platoon (page 58-63) or the vehicle (page 56-58). Move the mouse over
the order (it will highlight) and left-click. Keyboard equivalents are noted
beside each order. To change leaders from one tank to another you must use the
keyboard or the right-holddown menu. See page 66 for details.

The Outside View

This view is described on page 68. In the Amiga version a series of mouse
buttons are arranged across the top, with their keyboard equivalents noted in
blue. You can accelerate the left or right view by repeatedly clicking on the
same button. To stop turning, click once in the opposite direction. As 
described in the manual, "Turn to this Facing" rotates the vehicle to match
your current view direction.
