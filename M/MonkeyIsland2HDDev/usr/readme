 This install applies to "Monkey Island 2" Â© 1992 LucasFilms Games

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

History:
  version 1.3 (15.12.2018):
  - added POINTERTICKS=1 like Monkey Island (issue #0003987)
  
  version 1.2 (14.10.2018) done by JOTD:
  - only 1 "OS flash" when saving a game
  - source (included) is now compatible with VASM & Barfly
  
  version 1.1 (29.08.03):
  - Converted to WHDLoad v16
  - Tested on italian version

  version 1.0 (04.11.02):
  - Codewheel protection removed at least (UK & french versions tested)
  - Removed KickDOS, now uses original dos.library
  - Install script reworked
  - Manual and solution included
  - Source code included (note that I include a modified version of kick13.s
    because the original one is unable to run the game, which relies on the
    main loaded file to be "monkey2" or "monkey2.(something)")

  version 0.9 (2001): first WHDLoad release
  - Runs from HD using WHDLoad/KickEmu/KickDOS
  - Access fault removed
  - Protection not removed.
  - Choice of 3 kinds of icons

  old DOS patch
  - The patch I did 'round 1998 was a dirty DOS hack,
    cracking the game and fixing the display, but there were still display
    problems, and the pointer was still shifted (as it happens in the original
    DOS game on recent OS versions).
