 ==============================================================================

 This install applies to "ViroCop" (AGA) © 1995 Graftgold.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 version 1.6 (26.12.2023):

 but it's not obvious
 
 version 1.5 (01.04.2020):

   fixed (issue #0004093)
