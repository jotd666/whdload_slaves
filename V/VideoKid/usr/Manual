INTRODUCTION
  ------------
  
  Billy was just an ordinary everday kid who loved to watch television.
  One day, his father brought home a brand new video recorder and some
  cassettes.  Billy settled down to watch one, but instead of the sound
  of the video tape starting, he heard a crazy, evil laugh.  He approached
  the screen slowly, listening carefully.  Suddenly, the screen exploded 
  into a million particle, but instead of being thrown back by the blast,
  Billy found himself drawn in.

  He felt himself being sucked down endless tubes, tiny particles of light
  searing through his body.  Then, as suddenly as it had started, it 
  stopped, and the acrid smoke began to clear.  Looking down, Billy 
  realised that he was dressed as a Magician.
  'Billy, you are now trapped.  You must find your way through the mazes
  and worlds i have created for you.  There are five worlds to battle 
  through, each with evil monsters and hazards to impede you.  Should you
  succeed, you will be free to return to your normal life.  But if you
  fail......'.


  PLAYING VIDEOKID
  ----------------

  You are Video Kid.  You must travel through Five worlds, each of which
  is full of traps and enemies attempting to bring about your downfall.
  Each world except the first is made up of four sections, and ends with
  a Giant evil guardian, who must be destroyed before you progress to the
  next section.  Once you have completed the fifth world, you will have
  to face your biggest foe, but we will leave you to find out what that 
  entails yourself.

  The worlds that you will encounter are as follows:


  MEDIEVAL WORLD

  This world is placed within the confines of an ancient castle, and you
  will encounter Knights, Gargoyles, Giant enemy swords, ghostly monks
  and dangerous flying spears.  The castle will also prove dangerous,
  and you will find that a portcullis may try to crush you, a magical
  door may create extra enemies for you, or a gargoyle belch life 
  destroying fire at you.

  WESTERN WORLD

  This world has four parts, two dominated by cowboys, and two by Indians.
  On this level you will encounter hordes of dynamite wielding cowboys, 
  and more cowardly ones who hide in doorways or behind windows.  Vultures
  will swoop down and attack you, and lightning bolts from vicious clouds
  will try to fry you out of existence.  You will also come across fish in
  lakes which will attempt to ram you, and find that the forests are 
  populated with evil axe throwing beings.  The indian country has axe 
  wielding Indians who row across the water, as well as those hidden in 
  wigwams who will try to blow you up using small rockets.  Some clouds may 
  even try to drop anvils on your head.  Bats and snakes hide in caves, and 
  giant arrows from the end of world guardian will attempt to give you more
  holes than a teabag.

  SCIENCE FICTION WORLD

  The Sci-Fi world has many advanced life-forms, as well as quite a few not 
  very advanced ones, all attempting to zap your bones.  Flying spaceships 
  shoot widely at you, and bouncing aliens follow their bad example.  vicous
  splitting slugs and floating acid bubbles will also do you no good.  Alien 
  plants will shoot pods, and horrible tar drips from cavernous ceilings 
  try to engulf you.  Watch out for the missile armed spaceships hiding 
  within caverns, the spinning fans and advanced silicon chips that home in 
  on you, and just wait to you see the baddies waiting for you at the end!

  GANGSTER WORLD

  A very 1930's Chicago world with a vast array of men in heavy coats with 
  even heavier weaponary, attempting to machine gun you to death.  Watch 
  out for the cars packed with villians, and bi-planes who try to shoot or 
  bomb you with deadly grenades.  Once you are inside the bar area, hidden
  gangsters under tables will attempt to shoot you, or squash you with giant
  barrels, whilst all the time giant black bullets fill the air.

  HORROR WORLD

  Packed with ghosts, ghouls and zombies just for your delight, along with 
  skeletons and bats.  Monster trees will throw rocks at you, and coffins 
  open up to reveal mummies armed with deadly bullets.  Not to mention the 
  ghostly knights, and lots of other surprise beasties waiting for you.

  
  WEAPONARY AND WEAPON ICONS
  --------------------------

  You begin your quest with the standard fire weapon, but this can soon be 
  upgraded to more powerful arnaments.  The orange sphere will, when shot, 
  cycle through the different weapons available to you.  which weapons they 
  are will be dependant upon your current weapon, and what level of the game
  you are on.  They are in, in order, Missiles, Flame Thrower, Ripple 
  Arrows, Spheres, and finally the Laser weapon.  If you lose a life, then 
  you will lose one weapon, or one power up bonus.

  MISSILES

  Missiles are fast, but fairly weak.  They are still better than nothing
  though.

  FLAME THROWER
 
  This is the next step up.  The balls of flame move much more slowly than
  the missiles, but they do alot more damage.

  RIPPLE ARROWS

  The ripple arrows are next.  These arrows are a fast, and pack quite a 
  powerful punch. 

  SPHERES

  Slightly slower than the Ripple Arrows, but they are very powerful, and 
  do quite alot of damage.

  LASER

  The Laser is the ultimate weapon.  It has a medium speed, but is very 
  destructive, and is the only weapon that is able to pass through 
  background obstacles.


  POWER UP ICON
  -------------

  Collecting the Power Up icon, the blue sphere, will make Video Kids weapon
  more powerful and damaging.

  
  DIRECTION ICON
  --------------

  This is the grey sphere.  Shooting this icon will change it between three 
  different weapon types.

  1. Two Way Horizontal Fire

  This will allow you to fire your current weapon both backwards & forwards.

  2. Two Way Vertical Fire

  Allows you to fire current weapon up and down, as well as forwards, 
  providing weaponary in three directions.

  3. Two Way Diagonal Fire

  Your current weapon will now fire a total of three bolts forwards, making
  a very formidable weapon.

  
  EXTRA ICON
  ----------

  Instead of weapons, this icon will provide other assistance for your 
  perilous journey.  When shot, this icon will give you a choice of the
  following two weapons:

  SPHERE ICON

  This gives you a protective sphere which spins around.  This will kill
  any enemies that come just that little bit too close for comfort.

  BOMB ICON

  This will give you a bomb which will be thrown all of the time while 
  you have this.  these will fall through an arc before hitting the floor.

  SHIELD ICON

  Occasionally a shield icon will appear, which, if collected, will give 
  you a limited period of invulnerability.  The shield will spin around 
  you, and will slow down when it is about to expire.

  SMART BOMB ICON

  When collected, this icon will give you an extra smart bomb.
