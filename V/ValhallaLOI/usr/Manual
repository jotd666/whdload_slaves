                                 Prologue
                                 ~~~~~~~~


                     He said: I want to reach the stars
                         and I want you to help me.

                There exists a place where ideas are born
                      where the impossible is realised
                      where the creative spirit flies.

                        There came a day when reason
                         was exchanged for dreaming
                    and time was the greatest sacrifice
                    to witness nothing become something.

                        On this day the unbelievers
                looked up to the sky to see the sunrise on

                                 VALHALLA


                        He said: I like it up here!

                              The Beginnings
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        The two brothers had always been so different.
        The elder, Garamond, was a natural leader, strong and
	fair minded.  Infinity, on the other hand, was prone to
	tantrums and dark moods.

	Garamond was cherished by all of Valhalla - and, as
	the years passed, Infinity became wrought with
	jealousy.

	It was Valhalla law that decreed the eldest-born son
	of the high King was first in line to the Throne.
	When the old King died, Valhalla mourned for many
	days before Garamond was crowned King.

	The Bishop had watched Infinity on this day.  He had
	watched the hatred grow in his eyes and hew knew
	then Infinity would one day betray his brother.


                                 -PAGE 4-

                             ----------------



	Garamond was a good King: and under his reign
	Valhalla prospered.  He married a Princess from a
	neighbouring kingdom and she bore him a son - the
	little Prince of Valhalla.

	As time passed, Infinity became more and more
	withdrawn.  He would spend weeks wandering in the
	hills.  When he returned, he would lock himself in his
	chambers.  He would see no one.

	Then, on day a man dressed all in black, arrived on
	horseback and demanded to see Infinity.  The spent
	days shut away in Infinity's chambers, muttering
	quietly to each other.  This became a regular
	occurrence during the months that followed, until
	Infinity was receiving many visitors.

	The Bishop watched this new activity, his fears
	growing with each passing day.  He decided to inform
	the King.


                                 -PAGE 5-

                             ----------------



	Garamond would not listen, he had always
	defended his brother, refusing to see evil in
	anyone.  He told the Bishop not to judge Infinity,
	for this was not the was of Valhalla.

	No one remembers when the atmosphere of
	Valhalla began to change.  It had always been a
	kingdom of sunshine and laughter, but the days
	had begun to seem unnaturally-still and the
	people appeared subdued.

	The Bishop was wandering in the streets of his
	beloved Kingdom trying to understand what was
	happening around him, when he came across a
	small boy, crying in an alley.

	He told the Bishop he was frightened, and when
	the Bishop asked him why, the small boy stared at
	him with tear-filled eyes and said he had heard the
	people whispering about a plot to murder the King.


                                 -PAGE 6-

                             ----------------



	The Bishop cried out as he remembered the look on
	Infinity's face when his brother had been crowned
	King of all Valhalla.  The time had come: the betrayal
	was imminent.

	The Bishop ran to the castle and there he found the
	King in conference with his best warriors.  His face
	was pale and drawn.  The Bishop cried out: "Now do
	you believe me, can you see what is happening?
	My lord, your own brother is plotting to kill you?"

	The King rose to his feet, lifted his arms to the sky
	and cried: "Infinity, tell me it isn't true!"  The sound
	echoed through the chambers of the castle, and the
	reply came like a roll of thunder.  "You are not my
	brother, you are just an obstacle to my destiny and so
	you will die!"

	The stillness of the day that had gone before
	re shattered with that cry and Valhalla was filled with
	the sound of war.


                                 -PAGE 7-


                             ----------------



	It became apparent that Infinity had not been idle in
	those early years of Garamond's reign.  He had formed
	and army from the Nomads of Bandits who lived
	beyond the boundaries of Valhalla.  He had wooed
	them with talk of power and riches and they had
	become his faithful servants - the followers of Infinity.

	They fought with the fury of men with a mission,
	their minds had been poisoned by Infinity's words of
	evil - and, from the moment war had been declared,
	they descended on Valhalla like an army of
	destruction, leaving pain and suffering in their wake.

	Garamond had acted quickly to ensure the safety of
	the old, the women and the children - but the
	confusion and panic slowed him down and the
	followers of Infinity broke through the castle defences
	before they could escape.


                                 -PAGE 8-

                             ----------------



	Garamond found himself trapped by his people trying
	to escape.  He struggled to reach his wife but he was
	too late.  They killed he in cold blood before his
	unbelieving eyes; and act so abominable, he could not
	move or speak.  His cherished wife destroyed on the
	orders of his own brother.  It was too late for
	forgiveness.

	Garamond vowed on that day to protect his son at all
	costs.  The young Prince wa taken to the outskirts of
	Valhalla with only his nanny and a handful of guards
	to protect him.

	The war raged on for three long years.  How the
	Prince survived, no one knows.

	On the last night of the battle, the Kingdom of
	Valhalla was a land of destruction.  There were few
	men left to fight, but, exhausted as they were, they
	could not stop until either Garamond or Infinity was
	dead.


                                 -PAGE 9-

                             ----------------



	Outside the castle gate, in view of everyone beneath,
	a blood-red sky was there the final confrontation
	took place.  Garamond and Infinity raised their swords
	and prepared to fight.

	Garamond was still stronger, but, for one split
	second, a memory flashed into his mind of his brother
	when they were children.  Infinity saw his brother
	soften, he raised his sword high above his head - and
	struck!

	It was as if he fell in slow motion; the few survivors of
	the King's army staggered to their feet - but it was too
	late.  From that desolate place, they watched their
	King die.

	Silence engulfed the scene as Infinity gazed down at
	his broken brother; his eyes showed no remorse.
	This was his destiny.


                                 -PAGE 10-

                             ----------------



	The Bishop watched the outcome of his fears unfold
	before his eyes and could only turn his head away.
	As he did so, he noticed a small figure running wildly
	towards the dead King.  The old man's heart missed a
	beat as he realised it was the little Prince.

	Infinity screeched at his followers to kill the boy.

	The Bishop lunged forward and reached him first.
	As the small Prince struggled, the Bishop shouted for
	the help of one of Valhalla's warriors, who grabbed
	the child and slung him on to his horse.  Infinity could
	only watch as they galloped away.

	The very next day, Infinity crowned himself King.
	A shadow descended over the once-beautiful Valhalla
	- and there it has stayed for ten long years.

                             ----------------


	Despite extensive searched, the Prince was never
	found.  Though to this day Infinity swears he will not
	rest until the Prince is dead.

	The warrior who saved the Prince took him far to the
	north of Valhalla.  He stayed with him and taught him
	all the things his father had wanted him to learn.

	The Prince learnt of wisdom and temperance; he
	learnt of the history of justice and, most importantly,
	he learnt the secrets that had been passed down from
	King to first-born son for countless generations.

	Now, the Prince has come of age.  He is impatient
	to return to his beloved Valhalla, where he is the
	rightful King, to destroy his father's murderer and
	release the people of Valhalla from slavery and
	oppression.

                                 ~~~~~~~

	After drinking a potion, the Potion indicator on the
	left of the main screen rises to the top and slowly
	begins to descend.  When it reaches the bottom, the
	potion has run out and the Prince is no longer under
	the influence.  He can drink only one potion at a
	time, as a mixture could be fatal.


                                 Stamina
                                 ~~~~~~~

	If the Prince hurts himself, the Stamina indicator on
	the right of the main screen will go down.  When it
	reaches the bottom, you have no more stamina and
	the Prince will die.
	Do not be disheartened, though as you can always
	load in your previously-saved position or restart the
	level from the beginning.

	Stamina can be found during the course of the game
	so you can top-up your supply.

                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	If your wish to play the game without watching the
	beginning animation every time, then wait until the
	"Valhalla and the Lord of Infinity" logo has appeared
	and hold down the fire button on the joystick.  This
	will allow you to skip the credit sequence; and when
	the little Prince starts to make his introductory
	speech, he will will retire gracefully to allow you to get on
	with the adventure.
