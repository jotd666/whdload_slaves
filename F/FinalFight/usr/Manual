HINTS AND TIPS
--------------
-AS YOU FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH THE DIRTY STREETS-LOOK OUT FOR A STAIRCASE THAT
WILL LEAD YOU DOWN TO THE UNDERGROUND STOREROOM OF THE MAD GEARS.

-CRUSH ALL OPPOSITION IN THE STOREROOM BEFORE CONTINUING TO THE SUBWAY.

-BATTLE YOUR WAY ALONG THE PLATFORM UNTIL THE TRAIN ARRIVES.DURING YOUR JOURNEY
SEVERAL SUICIDAL ATTACKS SO BEWARE!!

-THE TRAIN STOPS BETWEEN STATIONS,GET OUT AND FIGHT YOUR WAY ALONG THE
TRACK,WHILE IN A DARK AND WET DRIPPING TUNNEL.

-YOU WILL THEN FIGHT IN AN UNDER GROUND WRESTLING RING AGAINST THE CHAPION,IN
FRONT OF 100`S OF SCREAMING MAD GEARS. STAMINA IS THE BEST WAY TO SUCESS.

-WHEN YOU HAVE DEFEATED THE ENEMY GAIN EXTRA POINTS BY SMASHING UP THE
CAR,PARKED AT THE FILLING STATION, AGAINST A TIME LIMIT.

-ATTACK THE ENEMY ON THE STREET JUST OUTSIDE THE RESTURANT THEN THROUGH THE BAR
AND INTO ANOTHER BLOOD THIRSTY WRSTLING ARENA,TO FIGHT MORE OF THE MAD GEARS
CHAMPIONS.

-FIGHT ALONG THE STREET AGAINST A CROOKED COP, HE WILL SHOOT AT YOU IN ORDER TO
DESTROY YOU,THEREFORE YOUR SPECIAL TECHNIQUES TO DESTROY THIS MENACING COP.

-WHEN CROSSSING A CATWALK IN THE INDUSTRIAL AREA, FIGHT THE MAD GEARS WHILE
AVOIDING JETS OF FLAME RISING FROM BELOW. THIS WILL LEAD YOU TOWARDS A
CONSTRUCTION LIFT WHERE YOU WILL COMBAT A MAGICAL,GRENADE LOBBING NINJA
COMMANDO.

-EXTRA POINTS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY BREAKING PANES OF GLASS IN THE FACTORY AGAINST
A TIME LIMIT.

-SAVE YOUR BEST COMBAT SKILLS AS YOU FIGHT PAST A RATHER ODD LOOKING STATUE OF
LIBERTY, FOR THE FINAL FIGHT TO FREE `JESSICA`

-BEGIN FIGHTING ON THE STREET NEAR THE HOTEL. ONCE INSIDE, AVOID FALLING
