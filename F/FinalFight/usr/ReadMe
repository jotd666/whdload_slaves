 This install applies to "Final Fight" © 1991 Capcom

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").
 (There is a "low memory" 512k slave provided which only needs 0.5 MB chipmem and 0.5 MB othermem)
 
 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

This installer requires the two original Final Fight disks. It supports two
versions. The original one and the KIXX re-release.

 version 1.7 (02.04.2020) done by JOTD:
 - added quitkey for 68000 machines (issue #0004203)

 version 1.6 (21.07.2016) done by JOTD:
 - removed remaining floppy drive access on KIXX version too

 version 1.5 (02.07.2016) done by JOTD:
 - removed remaining floppy drive access (SNOOP)

 version 1.4 (06.06.2016) done by JOTD:
 - 1MB slave provided: music during menu & fast character mirror supports
  (needs reinstall or decrunching of the "final" executable in "data" directory)
 - Install script rewritten from scratch
 
 version 1.3 (29.02.2016) done by JOTD:
 - now works on 68000 (access fault fix code introduced an odd address register value)
 - files can be crunched using ProPack, Crunchmania, TPWM, Imploder
 - installation subdir renamed to "data"
 - source code included
		
 version 1.2 (??) done by Gore Design:
 - Support for KIXX re-release added. Thanks to Andrew Barker for sending me his original
 - Icons changed

 version 1.0 and 1.1 (??) done by Gore Design:
 - Supports SPS version 1329
 - Slave now fully pc-relative
 - Exit key changed to Numl
 - Access faults removed
 - Disk protection removed
 
To activate cheat mode type SHERIFF FATMAN while pausing.

If you only have 512k chipmem and 24-bit expmem, you can use "FinalFight_512.slave" instead of the main one.
The game has a lot of issues with 32 bit memory, which explains it's better to remain on chipmem for high end machines.
