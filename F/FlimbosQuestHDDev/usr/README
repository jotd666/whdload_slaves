	That install applies to "Flimbo's Quest" © 1990 System 3.


	That install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.

	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").

	If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
	version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
	some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
	that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
	can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de
