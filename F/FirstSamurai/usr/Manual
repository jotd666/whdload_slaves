============================= First Samurai =============================

BACKGROUND
In a tiny village of ancient Japan, Lord Akira and his young samurai were collecting
taxes from the local peasants when the Demon King descended from the mountain.
The village was destroyed, all the inhabitants murdered, but the Demon King paid
special attention to the Warrior Lord. Fifteen minutes later, the young samurai was
alone with the Demon's final words; "Tell them about me, tell them I'm ready to take
back everything that is mine by right. Tell them their true Master has returned...!!"
On that cold morning, the young samurai swore revenge for his fallen Master.

For years the good people of the hills fought the Demon as best they could, until the
Wizard-Mage arrived from the sea and challenged the Demon. They fought long and
hard atop the Demon King's mountain, lightning and fire keeping the night aglow,
until the Demon, fearing defeat, escaped into time, hurling himself far into the future
where people had forgotten the magic and where he need fear no opposition...

The good people were safe, but for the young samurai there was no rest, for his soul
could not be at peace until he avenged his murdered Lord. So he begged the Mage that
he might follow the Demon into the future to bring The Demon King back so that he
could be destroyed at the foot of his own mountain throne....

This was how it began.



PACK CONTENTS

LOADING THE FIRST SAMURAI
Note: before we begin, please ensure that a joystick is plugged into the port marked
'JOYSTICK 2' on the Amiga, '1' on the ATARI ST and 'PORT 2' on the Commodore
64.



AMIGA & ATARI ST

If your computer is turned on, turn it off. After at least 30 seconds, turn on your
computer.

This will remove any virus which may be present and so minimise the risk of
infecting and possibly destroying your First Samurai disk.

Insert The First Samurai Disk One into internal disk drive (DF0: Amiga , or drive A
for Atari ST) Disk One contains a scene-setting sequence which can be 'fast
forwarded' by pressing the joystick firebutton.

When prompted to insert The First Samurai Disk Two, do so, and The First Samurai
will load and run.

Note: the sheer size of The First Samurai's map means that it is broken down into a
few carefully compressed bite-size chunks which are stored on Disk Two. For this
reason, The First Samurai Disk Two should remain in the computer's internal drive
for the duration of play. There will be no need to replace it with The First Samurai
Disk One, unless, of course, you wish to review the scene setting sequence.

If you wish to take advantage of the Personalized Access Code System (See YOUR
PERSONALIZED ACCESS CODE), you must ensure that The First Samurai Disk Two
is not write protected, ie, the hole in the top-left hand corner of the disk is closed.

==================================[ 5 ]==================================

============================= First Samurai =============================

COMMODORE 64


CASSETTE
Hold Down the 'Shift' key then press the "Run/Stop" key. Release and press PLAY
on the cassette deck when prompted.

The First Samurai will now load and run automatically.


DISKETTE

Ensure that the disk drive is attached to the Commodore 64 and turned on. Now turn
on your Commodore 64.

Insert the disk into the drive and shut the door, so to speak. Type LOAD "*",8,1 then
press the 'RETURN' key. The program will automatically load and run.

The credit screen is presented when The First Samurai has loaded correctly. From
here, play can begin or the Personalized Access Code menu can be accessed (see
YOUR  PERSONALIZED ACCESS CODE).

Press the joystick firebutton to return to the title screen at any time. From the title
screen, press fire again to start the game.

============================= First Samurai =============================

PLAYING THE FIRST SAMURAI
The Japan of the 24th Century is far removed from the country we know today. The
Demon King has ravaged the countryside and cities and now his minions inhabit the
ruins.

Our hero's mission unfolds through four sections of the tortuous countryside of
futuristic Japan (Fig 1) and continues with a thrilling high speed journey on (and in)
a subway train (Fig 2). The train's destination is the derelict suburbs of the Demon
King's city (Fig 3) beneath which his subterranean hordes roam in the complex sewer
network (Fig 4). Beyond the grime lies a near all-consuming battle through the
classier side of town (Fig 5) before the base of the Demon King's city skyscraper is
reached.

[Figure 1 omitted.]
Fig 1: The countryside of futuristic Ja-
pan looks serene but hides many dan-
gers such as bats and rats, fiery pits and
falling rock (some of them less obvious
than others).

speeding subway train in a scene vaguely
reminiscent of westerns of old.

many a ruck - and plenty of running and

=================================[ 13 ]==================================

============================= First Samurai =============================

BAD CREATURES

THE DEMON KING'S MALEVOLENT MINIONS
They are many and varied and each has its own characteristics and strengths. Note
that an adversary which has been hit will flash but that does not mean it will die as
not all minions can be killed. Points are given for each kill.



THE STATUS PANEL
The PHYSICAL ENERGY is that of the hero and is represented by an arm. The shorter
the arm the weaker the hero. When the hero's physical strength runs out, he dies
(unless he possesses the Magic Sword - see MAGIC SWORD).

Physical Energy is lost whenever the hero is hit by one of the Demon King's minions.
The hero begins his quest with his Physical Energy at a maximum.



MYSTICAL ITEMS

THE BELL
This is the most powerful mystical item. Use it only when no other course of action
can solve the problem you face.

=================================[ 14 ]==================================

============================= First Samurai =============================

ADDITIONAL WEAPONRY
There's no doubting the hero's unarmed combat skills - he's a lean, mean fighting
machine. But occasionally he may need a little helping hand in the form of an
additional weapon. These may be found during the Samurai's journey, but some
types may only be collected if the Samurai has sufficient magical energy. Only one
weapon can be held at a time: it is shown on the panel below the playfield. If the hero
is holding a weapon when he picks up another, the old weapon is lost. Additional
Weaponry is activated by pressing the joystick firebutton while the hero stands still.
When the player has insufficient magical energy a magical item will appear as a
sparkling star. Walking over the item will reveal its true form but the player will not
be able to collect it.


[Pictures of the weapons omitted.]
DAGGER
Throw out a deadly dagger. Better still, collect a maximum of three
daggers and you can have three on the go at once.

SEEKER
A deadly star orbits the hero until one of the Demon King's minions
nears. It then instinctively attacks the enemy. The hero can have a
maximum of 3 Seekers on the go at once. Bear in mind that a Seeker
will disappear when it runs out of hit power.

AXE
Throw a single axe. There can be no more.

=================================[ 15 ]==================================

============================= First Samurai =============================

MAGIC

THE WIZARD MAGE
The Samurai is not adept in the ways of magic. Fortunately for him, the Wizard Mage
is highly skilled in the mystical arts and may be summoned through time to aid the
Samurai.

Note: The Wizard Mage occasionally makes a fleeting appearance in times of trouble.
When he appears, you know it's time to summon him.



SPECIAL ITEMS

The Wizard Mage is powerful but sometimes the problems presented are not soluble
without a helping hand. On each level the hero needs to collect Special Items. When
a Special Item is collected, the Wizard Mage appears to take it from the hero. When
the moment comes, the Wizard Mage will use the Special Items to solve a particular
problem. Note that you do not have to collect EVERY Special Item on a level - just
most of them!

The MYSTICAL ENERGY is  that of the hero's Magic Sword (see THE MAGIC
SWORD). The energy of every creature killed is absorbed by the Magic Sword and
shown as this bar. The longer the bar, the greater the quantity of Mystical Energy
stored. This Mystical Energy is used to charge pots. The hero begins his quest with
a small amount of Mystical Energy, which is increased by defeating the Demon King's
Minions in battle.



REGENERATION POTS
Regeneration Pots are dotted about the landscape in opportune places (Fig 6). A
charged Regeneration Pot marks the position on the landscape to where the hero will
be returned when he is reincarnated following the loss of a life or when he uses a
transport option.

A pot is charged by positioning the Samurai over it and crouching down. The
Mystical Energy accumulated during play will then flow into the Regeneration Pot.
Only one pot can be active at any one time, but the hero can reactivate a previously
charged Pot and so determine a restart position for the hero.

=================================[ 16 ]==================================

============================= First Samurai =============================

[All pictures on this page omitted.]
FIG 6 : an uncharged Regeneration Pot



POTIONS
Pick up a Potion (Fig 7) and the hero is TRANSPORTED to the last
charged Regeneration Pot.

Fig 7: the potions transport the player to the determined restart point.



THE MAGIC SWORD
The hero begins his quest without his Magic Sword. The Magic Sword is only given
to the hero when he collects  sufficient Mystical Energy.  Not only does the Magic
Sword effectively extend the First Samurai's reach, it also spares him instant death.
When the hero's Physical Energy reaches zero, the Magical Sword is lost but the hero
lives on, his Mystical Energy converted to a small portion of Physical Energy.



TRANSPORTERS
Watch out for transporters. When the hero touches one, press and hold down the
joystick firebutton to transport him to a new area of the scenery.  It could even be
another transporter.



PLAYERS LIVES REMAINING
The player's mission begins with five reincarnations of the hero. See if you can
discover how to acquire extra lives.

=================================[ 17 ]==================================

============================= First Samurai =============================

YOUR PERSONALIZED ACCESS CODE

So what is your Personalized Access Code? Well, when a level is completed, the
program remembers the stage reached along with the number of lives and score at
that time and the time spent playing thus far. The player can store this information
on Disk Two and then access it to avoid playing what's come before. This effectively
determines the starting position of play.

The player can save the Personalized Access Code at the end of a game or after
quitting. At this time the game will go to the highscore table and then the title screen.
From the title screen credits, press 'F1' to call up the personalized access code menu.
There are 10 slots to which the state of play can be saved, one for each level. Any
previously saved situations will be shown. To save your current status, press the 'S'
key. Note that any existing code for the level in question is replaced.

To load a saved situation, press the corresponding function key for the level required.
For example, press F1 to restart at level 1.

=================================[ 18 ]==================================

============================= First Samurai =============================
 
BONUSES

The First Samurai rewards the player for good play in the form of many bonuses. The
Statistics for the bonuses acquired during a level can be viewed by pressing the 'B'
key. However, the actual bonuses are not given until the level in question is
completed. Press the firebutton to return to the action.

The quantity of food collected.

SPECIAL OBJECTS HELD

=================================[ 19 ]==================================

============================= First Samurai =============================

ADVICE

Try striking the scenery -- hidden bonuses may be uncovered, such as food or extra
weaponry. There is an object worth collecting which should throw a little light on the
position of hidden bonuses.

Some areas of the scenery are destructible -- don't be afraid to hit out at anything that
looks remotely fragile.

The chests hold treasure. Strike them a couple of times to scatter their contents.
Simply walk over the treasure to collect.

The baskets hold food which replenishes Physical Energy. Strike them a couple of
times to scatter their contents. Simply walk over the food to collect it.

Beware of landmines -- you will recognise one having trodden on one!

Watch out for opponents who drop weapons -- you can pick them up.

Finding it impossible to cross the flaming pit or in need of some means to reach
seemingly unreachable heights? The Wizard Mage will prove useful.
