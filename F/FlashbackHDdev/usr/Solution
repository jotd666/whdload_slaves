    First, I Must Say DON'T USE ANY TRAINERS.  They Fuck The Game, And
Besides They Are NOT Necessary. If You Can't Play The Game As It Is,
Drop It.

    Thanx To DELPHINE SOFTWARE  And US GOLD For Compiling Such An Excellent
Piece Of Software For The Best Machine On The Market.

    Special Thanx To JERRY For Providing Extensive Translations From French,
Since It Happens That I Do Not Speak That Language.  Withoout Him, I Don't 
Think I'd Get Too Far In This Fantastic Soft...

    Right Now The 100% English Fix For This Game Is Fantastic.  It removes
All Of The Password Protections And Works Excellent! Get It!!!
