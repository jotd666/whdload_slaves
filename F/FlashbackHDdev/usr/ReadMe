 This install applies to "Flashback" Â© 1992 Delphine Software

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick345.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de
