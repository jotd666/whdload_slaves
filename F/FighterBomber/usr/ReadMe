 EXTRA NOTES
 -----------
 
 A classic game for the Amiga, showing its age slightly, but still a great game.
 99 Designer game saves are possible, Pilots Log is generated on first runtime.
 
 The language selector never worked because there are is no French text in the game!
 The format option has also been removed, it is unneccesary.
 Not much else to say, other than I would much rather fix 20 Fighter Bomber versions
 than have to bother with 1 more version of Crackdown!!!
 
 Enjoy
 
Kindest Regards, Galahad of Fairlight
