     CREW BRIEFING
     An expectant hush fell over the briefing room as the powerful figure of Major
     Lance 'Deadeye' Mulchay took the stage. Glancing around the unusally
     crowded room, he leant his enormous, battle-scarred frame against the edge of
     his lectern. With a tap on the microphone, and a nod to his staff officers
     standing at the back, he began.

     "Don't worry fellas, I ain't gonna sing." How many times had he said that, he
     wondered, and at how many briefings. The War was a long time ago, but he felt
     every minute of it.

     "Ladies and gentlemen, and you flyers at the back there, welcome to Ellsworth
     Air Force Base." A nod to his left, and a series of slides began to appear on
     the screen behind him.

     "This is the annual Strategic Air Command Bombing Competition; ten years ago,
     the awesome collection of firepower out there on the tarmac would have been
     an unthinkable sight on a US Base. But in these days of detente, and goodwill
     to all men, even the Russkies," he paused for a laugh befitting a man of his
     seniority, "ha ha - only kidding comrades; where was I? Oh yeah - in these
     days when the cold war is becoming a fading memory, we of the free world can
     welcome pilots from all over to join us and test their capabilities against
     the best competition a defence budget can buy. This doesn't mean we're gonna
     let them out again, though, eh boys? Ha ha."

     The Soviet contingent merely smiled, content in the knowledge that in a few
     hours they were going to get the chance to wipe the smile of this ageing
     ace's face for good. The Major continued.

     "Behind me you see an aviation legend - The Lancaster Bomber. Without that
     baby the map of Europe might well be different today. An enormous beast, it
     could deliver a payload of staggering weight and destructive power. But it
     had one major problem - it was just too darn BIG. Little Messerschmitts used
     to creep up behind it and blow it out of the air. So we had to guard it, with
     other fighters like the Spitifire here, and the Hurricane. This was the same
     with all those big guys - the Wellington, the Stirling, our own B-17 and so
     on. Near the end of the war it became obvious that what we wanted was both,
     all in one plane. So we had the Mosquito, and later the F-100, and the
     British Lightning, that began to combine the speed of a fighter with the pay-
     load capacity of a bomber, and all in a much smaller package." Deadeye paused,
     for dramatic effect, and to smooth his moustache for the ladies. Both worked -
     the audience was his.

     ** Techie note here... since when was the Lightning a bomber, Activision?? **

     "And now we have the bunch of death machines you see outside - the ultimate in
     flying destruction, Multi-Role Combat Aircraft from all over, from the Soviets'
     Mig 27 to our own F-15. And in a few hours you will see just what those babies
     can do. They will fly against each other in mock battle, they will take out
     strategic targets around this and the neighbouring states - without any
     warheads, I can assure you, " he added for the benefit of a few front-benchers
     who had begun to look worried about the idea of armed MiG 27s flying over the
     Mid-West.

     "Oh, I don't know, Chief," came a voice from the back. "There's a few parts of
     Montana I guess we wouldn't miss."









     "OK Kowalski, very funny - now button it, or you're peeling potatoes all next
     week." One thing Major Mulcahy hated worse than a smart-ass flyer, it was one
     who got a bigger laugh than himself. But he recovered.

     "So, fellow officers, welcome guests, and members of the press, prepare
     yourselves for a display of combat flying that'll knock your socks off, and
     may the best man win," he said, peering at the Curtis E LeMay Trophy that
     stood in pride of place, waiting to won by the top team of the day.

     "As long as it's us, of course," he whispered quietly to himself.

     Sitting at the rear of the briefing room was a lone pilot with a hard task
     ahead of him. He knew the competition - every good pilot did - but this
     didn't make it any easier. He had to prove to his superiors that he was the
     best, that he was ready to go up against anything the enemy could throw at
     him and come out on top. And this trophy was the way to do it.

     He had already had a look around the area before landing his jet, checking
     out the four US states that would be the arena for the mock battle. Some of
     the most spectacular scenery in the west was here - Mount Rushmore, the
     famous monument to the four historic presidents, Devil's Tower national
     monument (how many times had he seen 'Close Encounters' - almost as many as
     'Top Gun' he guessed), and the plains and towns and cities of the American
     Mid-West, heartland to the world's leading nation.

     He knew the missions he must accomplish in order to score maximum points, to
     gain the title Ace of Aces, and he knew it was going to be tough - but then,
     no-one ever said war was easy.

     In FIGHTER BOMBER, you are that pilot. But first you must ready yourself with
     a series of training missions. Sure, you've flown those runs a hundred times,
     but never was the prize this big, never was the competition this hot.

     You have your pick of the best of the world's technology, and also the choice
     of combat enemies. This doesn't make life any easier, though - any one of the
     pilots gathered at Ellsworth could take this trophy.

     It's your job to see that they don't.

     THE CURTIS E LeMAY TROPHY

     The Curtis E LeMay Bombing Trophy, the prize every aspiring Bomber Squadron
     hopes to gain, is presented in honour of the retired Commander in Chief of
     SAC.

     It's first victor, in 1958, was the 92nd Bomb Wing of the USAF in a B-52D.
     From 1977 to 1982, the USAF FB-111A stood victorious, while in more recent
     years the trophy has been snatched twice by the British 617 and 27 squadrons,
     both using the Tornado.

     AIRCRAFT SELECTION
     FIGHTER BOMBER features seven different aircraft for you to fly. These are:

             The McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle - United States Air Force
             The McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom - USAF
             The General Dynamics F-111F Aardvark - USAF
             The Panavia Tornado IDS - Royal Air Force
             The Panavia Tornado IDS - Luftwaffe








             The Saab AJ37 Viggen - Royal Swedish Air Force
             The Mikoyan-Gurevich Mig-27 Flogger D - Soviet Air Force (CCCP)

     Information on the ability of each of these machines can be found by clicking
     INFO on each aircraft. ** This isn't totally accurate; for instance, the '27
     really IS a pile of crap, and everybody knows it! Also, the 'Aardvark' is
     actually an electronic counter-measures platform, not a bomber. **

     These planes are displayed for selection as soons as the game is loaded. A 2D
     and 3D representation of the various aircraft featured are available to you
     along with historical and technical information. We suggest you take advantage
     of this information as later missions will expect you to recognise instantly
     the kind of aircraft you are engaging.

     Selection is made with the mouse as normal.

     ENEMY AIRCRAFT SELECTION

     Uniquely, FIGHTER BOMBER allows you to select the kind of enemy
     aircraft you will encounter in your various missions. Each enemy
     aircraft will respond to you differently and you will soon learn which
     will present the greatest challenge in the various theatres of engagement.

     FB features seven different aircraft for you to fly against. These are:
             The F-14 Tomcat - United States Navy (USN)
             The F-16 Falcon - USAF
             The F-5 Tigershark - USN/USAF
             The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29 Fulcrum - CCCP
             The Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker - CCCP
             The Dassault Mirage 2000 - Armee de l'air (France)
             The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-31 Foxhound - CCCP

     PILOT'S LOG
     Press SPACE to enter a new pilot on the roster screen. Type in the name and
     press RETURN. Press RETURN again to select a pilot.

     Every time you fly, your progress is recorded and filed against your flight
     log. So leave your Pompey Pirates disk 22 write-enabled!

     MISSION SELECTION
     For your first flight in FB, we recommend you select FREE FLIGHT. This will
     allow you to familiarise yourself with the flight controls and become
     proficient at some of the more complex manoeuvres you will need to master.

     FREE FLIGHT differs to every other stage of FB in that it is the only option
     that allows you to choose where you start from, and use ACCELERATED TIME-
     skip all that boring uneventful flying!

     The start-point options available to you are as follows:
             MT RUSHMORE     Allows the programmers to show off
             ON RUNWAY       Starts you on the runway at Ellsworth
             AT 30000 FT     Allows practice of high altitude manoeuvres
             ABOVE BRIDGE    Allows you to practice bombing runs
             OVER CITY       Allows you to fly over Rapid City
             BEHIND TANKER   Allows practice of inflight refuelling
             LINED UP        Allows practice of landing procedure

     Once you are accustomed to your controls and environment, then you can attempt








     the first of the qualification missions.

     THE MISSIONS
     Each mission is only available when the previous one has been completed. To
     start with, only operation 'Sleeper' is available under COVERT.

     Once a mission has ended, the mission briefing screen will appear, allowing
     you to examine the route flown and your mission report.

     To continue, click on END, then select NEW MISSION for a... new mission!!

     ** Don't worry if you get blown out of the sky... your pilot doesn't die,
     remember this is all simulated war... you just get another unsuccessful
     mission on your flight log. Also, if you want a look at the missions you're
     not yet eligible for, when selecting a pilot, enter your name as "HOORAY FOR
     MICK". You can then play any mission, but you're stuck with that name! Other
     boring messages can be got by typing the following in for your pilot name:
     "KYLIE", "SO WHAT IF I DO" and "BUCKAROO". **

     MISSION BRIEFING
     The options are:
             MISSION TEXT    Your mission brief... read carefully and REMEMBER!
             AREA RECON      Check out any map area from a camera aircraft
             TARGET RECON    Check out any target from a camera aircraft
             TARGET INFO     Tells you what any target is
             OK              Commence mission

     MISSION DESIGN
     Options are:
             SELECT AIR BASE Select the mission starting point, any of the
                             flashing diamonds. It is not compulsory to land
                             at that base- you may land anywhere that's got
                             a runway!
             ADD TARGET      Select a target and then position it on the map
             REFUEL POINT    Select the altitude and position of the tanker
             DELETE LAST     Clears the last target entered
             RECONNAISSANCE  Allows you to view target areas in order to aid
                             area and target recognition. Target info can also
                             be obtained
             MISSION TEXT    Allows you to enter your description of the mission
             DISK MENU       Allows you to LOAD/SAVE missions
             TEST MISSION    Allows you to fly the mission, after which you get
                             the normal briefing, and are then returned to the
                             designer
             END             Leaves the mission designer

     ** To save missions, you will need a seperate blank disk. You cannot save
     on the FB disk! You can format a disk from within the disk menu. Then click
     on the blank area at the bottom of the file selector box, type in your
     filename, press RETURN, and finally click SAVE or LOAD. **

     ARMING
     After choosing the mission, you must arm your aircraft appropriately.

     Weapons are selected by clicking over the weapon's graphic and dragging it
     to the small underside view of the aircraft. If a pylon is available for a
     weapon, it will flash. Not all pylons are suitable for all weapons. Some
     pylons can carry multiple weapons, e.g. three Mavericks.









     AUTO ARM will arm your machine with a suitable payload, but it is often
     better to choose yourself. One exception is with the F-15E; manually loading
     with Mavericks will give you 13 in total. Auto arm will give you 14 for some
     reason... hell, don't knock it, that's the kind of bug I like!

     Weapons available are:
     1. 23/27 mm Cannon
     Used for close combat, many aircraft of the late 60's and early 70's were
     built without a cannon. The philosophy behind this being that with the
     advent of sophisticated guided missiles, an aircraft would never get within
     cannon range. The experience of the Vietnam war proved the fallacy of this.
     Most modern aircraft are equipped with a cannon either internally or as a
     centrally mounted pod taking up the centreline pylon.

     2. Air to air missile (AAM)
     AIM-9L Sidewinder / Bofors Rb-24 / AA-8 Aphid
     Weight:         195 lb (88.5 kg)
     Performance:    Mach 2.5 in 2.2 seconds
     Range:          11 miles (17.7 km)
     Mission time:   60 secs max.
     Warhead:        25 lb (11.4 kg) blast/fragmentation with active laser IR
                     proximity fuse
     The Sidewinder is an AAM guided to the target by locking on to the heat
     emitted by an enemy aircraft's tailpipe. Afterburners make especially
     attractive targets to such a missile! As the missile locks on to a target,
     a rising growl sounds in the pilot's headset until it reaches peek intensity
     at which point it is locked on, and the pilot should fire. When the laser
     proximity fuse senses it is close enough to a target, it explodes, sending
     out hundreds of preformed rods into the target.

     3. Air to surface missile (ASM)
     AGM-65A Maverick / Bofors Rb-75 / AS-7 Kerry
     Weight:         635 lb (288 kg)
     Performance:    Classified
     Range:          Up to 25 miles after Mach 1.2 release at altitude
     Warhead:        282 lb steel cased blast/fragmentation or 83 lb shaped charge
     The AGM-65A is a video guided ASM. The pilot selects the missile, causing it's
     gyro to spin up to speed and light up a weapon ready indicator on his control
     panel. The image from the video camera is swung round on to the target and the
     pilot engages lock mode. He then uses either the video display or his head-up
     display sight to lock on to the target. The weapon is then released. After
     release the weapon remains locked on to the video image of the target and
     intelligently tracks it, even if it's moving. In the event of the image being
     interrupted the missile will follow it's last known trajectory. Even if the
     warhead fails to detonate, the heat caused by the impact would kill or disable
     a tank's crew for instance.

     4. AGM-88A HARM
     Type:           Anti Radiation missile
     Weight:         796 lb (361 kg)
     Performance:    Mach 2+
     Range:          About 11 miles
     Warhead:        Fragmentation with proximity fuse
     The AGM-88A is a kind of missile developed as a direct result of the ever-
     increasing technology used in modern air warfare. The missile uses the very
     radiation emitted by a ground radar tracking station to home in on. The pilot,
     suspecting an enemy is in the vicinity, can fire the missile 'blind'. If the








     enemy emits any kind of electromagnetic radiation, the missile will lock on.

     5. Mk 13/18 Paveway II LGB
     Type:           Laser-guided unpowered bomb
     Weight:         1,030 lb (467.6 kg)
     Performance:    Freefall
     Range:          Dependent on rlease altitude
     Warhead:        High explosive
     The Laser Guided Bomb is a system designed to improve the accuracy of
     conventional bombs. The target is illuminated with laser light, either by the
     launch aircraft, a second aircraft, or even friendly ground troops. A ring of
     sensors around the nose of the bomb detects the reflected laser light and by
     passing signals to the movable controls surfaces of the bomb, keep it aligned
     with the target. The system is cheap, effective and requires no modification
     to the aircraft.

     6. General Purpose Bomb
     Type:           Unguided unpowered bomb
     Weight:         1,000 lb (454.6 kg)
     Performance:    as for LGB
     Range:          as for LGB
     Warhead:        as for LGB (** an LGB is one of these with bits bolted on **)
     The accuracy of these babies has in the past been soley dependent on the skill
     of the crew, wind, etc. With today's modern aircraft the computer takes over
     calculating velocity, altitude, wind-shear, etc. The pilot is told when to
     press the button and the computers do the rest. ** But not in this game. Great
     huh, we're reduced to guessing when to drop the damn things. Take my advice
     and never use the useless pieces of junk! **

     7. JP-233 MWI - Airfield Denial Weapon
     Type:           Submunition dispenser
     Weight:         11,200 lb (5,080 kg)
     Payload:        Various bomblets
     The JP-233 is a series of submunition dispensers for parachute retarded
     payloads which include pavement cratering bomblets and anti-personnel
     mines with or without delayed action fuses. It's main use is for denying
     enemy forces their airfields. ** The bomblets spread in a generally broad
     pattern, so cutting a swathe across all the nice clean tarmac! But, seeing
     as there are no missions requiring runway denial, you'll never need this
     weapon. Another cockup from Vektor! **

     8. BOZ-100 ECM Pod - Chaff and IR Decoy flare dispenser
     Weight:         1,000 lb (454 kg)
     Such devices are often fitted internally, but this is an externally carried
     one. It enables the aircraft under attack from missiles to defend itself
     in two ways: An IR guided missile follows strong heat emissions, so flares
     will fool it into tracking the flare instead of your tailpipe, and chaff;
     hundreds of strips of metal; will create an attractive radar target for radar
     guided missiles. Don't worry about running out of either chaff or flares- you
     have an infinite supply.

     9. Durandal - Runway Penetration Bomb
     Weight:         430 lb (195 kg)
     Warhead:        High explosive
     The Durandal is a simple but effective method of cratering and this rendering
     useless enemy paved landing strips. The weapon is released as lows as 185 ft
     and is immediately retarded by a parachute, causing it to point nose down. The
     rocket motor then fires the warhead deep into the concrete, from where it








     explodes upwards, creating a crater of up to 2,000 square feet! ** See note
     above about JP-233. **

     10. Rocket Pods
     These have been the mainstay of the ground attack arsenal since WW2. The pilot
     aims the aircraft at the ground target and fires a salvo of high explosive
     shells direct in the line of flight, just like using the cannon. This is
     particularly effective against mobile armour.

     11. ALARM - Air Launched Anti Radiation Missile
     Weight:         390 lb
     Performance:    Awful
     Range:          Abysmal
     Propulsion:     Two stage solid propellant motor
     Warhead:        Yes
     ALARM is the British equivalent of the US HARM missile. It is fired in the
     general direction of enemy positions (e.g. SAM sites) and climbs to around
     40,000 ft. It then pitches nose down and falls slowly, under a drogue
     parachute, while searching for hostile radio/radar emmissions. As soon as
     the enemy 'switches back on', the missile locks on the target and fires it's
     secondary motor, homing in on the enemy position. ** The real thing's range
     might be classified, but in the game it seems to be a paltry 2 miles!! I've
     found it next to useless, and it's probably better to use Mavericks and lock
     on visually- tricky, as radar sites are so tiny, and the closer you get, the
     more likely it is that you will intrude in it's radar net, and so be fired
     upon. Hey Sledge, looks like they've simulated it perfectly... the real
     thing doesn't work either, does it? Ha ha! **

     Okay, that's the original manual except for all the useless bumf and trimmings
     at the end (which is in the game itself anyway- the INFO selections for the
     different aircraft). The rest of this is all my own work as they say...

     THE AIRCRAFT
     F-15E           Originally a dedicated medium/short range fighter. Modified to
                     the two seat F-15E, and strengthened to carry heavy ground
                     attack payloads. Fast, manoeuvreable and carries a seriously
                     large amount of weapons. Take it!
     F-4E            Ancient (1960's), but a good workhorse. Designed as a fighter
                     too, but more than adequate as a bomber. Used as such to great
                     effect in Vietnam. Not particularly brilliant in any respect,
                     but certainly not lacking either.
     F-111F          Another golden oldie, the 'F' designation means Fighter as
                     always, but the F-111 really isn't up to the job. Poor
                     manoeuvrablity and sluggish handling will put you in hot
                     water when under attack from other aircraft. On the other
                     hand, it can carry a large amount of weapons comfortably
                     over large distances- witness the Libya raid of a couple of
                     years ago.
     Tornado         Designed as a bomber primarily, and damn good at it's job. It
                     has since been modified to the ADV (Air Defence Variant) type,
                     which is the RAF's equivalent of the F-15. So no problems in
                     the air to air combat department! Payload is excellent, it
                     responds well and it's a good all-round choice.
     Viggen          The aerial Volvo. Tough, dependable, and extremely good at
                     running rings around bandits. Payload isn't so hot... only a
                     light load can be carried, and not as large a range as the
                     Tornado or F-15. Fuel conserving isn't high on this baby's
                     list of priorities, either. The real thing has been designed








                     to use motorways as landing strips in case of paved runways
                     being destroyed. Whether you can do that in the game is as
                     yet a mystery... try it!
     Flogger         Oh dear... Well, one point in it's favour is that the Soviets
                     have a fighter version- the MiG 23-, so you can probably hold
                     your own in a dogfight. Unfortunately, payload is limited and
                     fuel is another problem. I'd only go for this if all the
                     other planes had been nuked or something...

     And the opposition...
     F-14            Ooooh... you are in deep you-know-what if one of these shows
                     up! Designed as a tough, fast, highly manoeuvrable long/medium
                     and short range fighter, it's got missiles with YOUR name on
                     them! It's size will give you an advantage if you engage at
                     high speeds- if you have a smaller aircraft you'll be turning
                     tighter than the F-14.
     F-16            Hell, you fly one in Falcon- you should know all about these!
                     Fast, tiny, mega manoeuvrable and seriously bad news if you're
                     weighed down with bombs! If you don't get it on the first pass
                     you better run for it, cos these guys are HOT in dogfights!
     F-5             Used by the US Navy Agressors squadron to simulate Soviet
                     aircraft (go watch Top Gun). Performance below that of the
                     F-16, but not by much. You might think these guys are an easy
                     option- not so. The speed and ferocity with which the F-5s
                     attack in the game has to be seen to be believed!
     MiG-29          The Soviet F-16? Nasty meeting one of these at close range...
                     hit him quick or he'll be all over you!
     Su-27           Wow, a gap in my knowledge... looks like a tougher, possibly
                     long range variation of the MiG-29/F-16. Maybe even as deadly
                     as the F-15 would be if you were faced with one!
     Mirage 2000     Ha ha ha... a frog plane! Meant to be a good all round fighter
                     but probably has problems at low speeds and altitudes, so a
                     dogfight won't be particularly worrying. Watch out if he tries
                     to sneak up on you at high altitude, though!
     MiG-31          No, not the Firefox! Still bad news though... almost
                     definitely the Soviet F-15, this one. Large, heavy, and not
                     primarily a dogfighter, it's more of a long range fighter.
                     This is my favourite adversary... it's so big, it can't really
                     worry me in a dogfight- it can't turn tight enough and ends up
                     making high speed passes and hoping for a good missile shot.

     COCKPIT DISPLAY
     The cockpit is mostly just decoration. The bits you'll need to worry about
     are as follows:

     ADI/Artificial Horizon: the brown/blue ball shows the attitude of your plane
     to the horizon. Sod all use really.

     Radar: switchable to ranges of 25/12/6/3 miles. Some aircraft (e.g. Tornado)
     have better radars. When locked on to an air target, the target's radar blip
     changes color with the better radars.

     Target display: this window shows either 'NO AIR/GROUND TARGET', the altitude,
     speed, bearing of an air target or a zoomed picture of a ground target.

     Information window: switchable to show current waypoint/current weapon ammo.

     Undercarriage indicators: if all three are green, your wheels are ready to








     kiss concrete. If all three are grey or black, the wheels are safely retracted
     and if there's any combination (e.g. one green, two grey), it's time to take
     up a new career- like maybe skydiving!

     Stall light: if this lights up, it means you've passed below the point at
     which your airspeed is sufficient to keep you aloft. The aircraft will nose-
     dive- wait until your airspeed goes up again to around 120 Kts and then pull
     up to avoid ploughing some farmer's field for free.

     IR light: if this lights up and beeps, there is an infra-red homing missile
     coming for a visit. Throw out some flares!!

     RH light: if this lights up and beeps, Mister Radar Homing Missile is about
     to arrive. Use some chaff, or die. Simple, huh?

     Message window: just tells you about major events in your locale. For example,
     incredibly interesting things like 'CHAFF RELEASED', 'TARGET DESTROYED', 'PULL
     UP YOU CRAZY IDIOT' etc. etc.

     Air brake light: if it's on, so's the air brake.

     Wheel brake light: no doubt you can figure this one out.

     Fire light: hmmmm... never had it light up myself, so maybe it's just more
     decoration. Anyway, if it does light up, I'd recommend a nice invigorating
     walk home. Either that, or stay in the plane and burn to death!

     Fuel indicator: when it hits the bottom, you're flying a bad tempered glider!

     Thrust indicator: shows level of engine power being used. Turns yellow when
     afterburner is being used.

     Compass: wow, who needs it?

     Airspeed indicator: the dial with KTS written on it. Totally useless. Use the
     HUD instead!

     Altimeter: the dial with FT written on it. Useless again.

     AND ON THE HEAD UP DISPLAY
     Altitude: shown on the right, above 'FT'.

     Airspeed: shown on the left, above 'KTS'.

     Heading: shown at the top (HDG).

     Current weapon: shown bottom left. If 'ARM' is above it, the weapon is armed
     and ready to fire. If it's 'LOCK' tben it's locked on to a target, it nothing
     is showing above it, there's no ammo left.

     Weapon sight: shown in centre, if weapon has a sight that is!

     LANDING YOUR AIRCRAFT
     (nope, nothing about this in the manual)

     REMEMBER the landing instructions you are given in the mission text. If you
     are given a number for the runway you need to land on, note it down. If you
     are given discretion about landing, you can land at any airfield- even the








     civilian ones- on any runway. To figure out what runway you need from the
     number given...
     Runway number   Runway points
          36            North
          18            South
     The runway will also have the number on the tarmac! The number is actually
     the heading needed to land on it divided by 10, e.g. runway 18=180 degrees.
     Also, in some missions you're told to use runways like '36L' or '18R'. The
     R and L mean left and right of course, so take the runway on the left or
     right, whatever you've been told.

     Now, once you've got the runway in sight, drop thrust to 20% to get your
     speed down. When at about 300 Kts, push it back up to 40%. Align yourself
     with the runway you're going to land on- you may find having a Maverick
     sight up will help. Point at the end of the runway closest to you, drop
     speed to below 300 Kts and lower the undercarriage. Keep thrust at around
     40% to keep from stalling. You should be aiming for crossing the runway
     threshold at about 100 Ft and 190 Kts. Once over the threshold, pull the
     nose up level, drop thrust to 10% (or even cut the engine if you want
     to be flash... but no second chances if you foul up, because you won't
     get the thrust to pull up) and hit the air brakes to drop speed to around
     140 Kts if you aren't that slow already. Now you should be sinking gently
     onto the tarmac- keep that nose straight now! The lack of airspeed will
     cause altitude loss naturally, so don't point the nose down unless you
     fancy digging a crater! When the wheels hit the tarmac (did you bounce?
     Yes? You useless idiot!), cut the engine, hit the airbrakes if they're
     not already on, wait a sec and then hit the wheelbrakes. Wait till you
     roll to a stop, and voila! Landing complete! On some missions you're
     required to land at more than one airfield- to pick up and drop secret cargoes
     at secret airfields. Just land and take off as normal.

     INFLIGHT REFUELLING
     This is incredibly tricky to start with! The FREE FLIGHT practice option
     is of limited use- to actually make some practical use of it, you'll have
     to alter your heading a lot and get well off the perfect approach you're
     lumbered with! For the real thing, you will probably fly right past the
     tanker as it flies head to head with you. So, hit the airbrakes, pull
     round as tightly as possible and follow it. Match altitude as exactly as
     possible, keep the wings level and use the rudder to position yourself
     exactly behind the tanker. Now keep your speed at around 350 Kts and let
     the tanker crew do the work. The tanker should line itself up pretty well,
     and drift towards you. When the refuelling basket is just about to hit
     your probe (or even if it's just missed and you're about to overshoot),
     hit the airbrakes again. The probe should lock firmly into the basket, and
     you are now 'snouting' successfully! Disengage when your fuel is full, and
     dive away to avoid hitting the tanker. A tip: the tanker always heads due
     South when the crew sight you, so try and get the tanker heading to be 180,
     then match the heading yourself.

     AIR TO AIR COMBAT
     When you first realise somebody's got their eye on you, turn hard towards
     them to get into firing position quickly! If they're very close or you can't
     see them even though the radar says they're right next to you, break hard
     away from their radar position- this means they're very close- maybe even
     below you, and that's bad news- collisions aren't fun! If you can eyeball
     them, hit them quick with missiles- but do wait for a good steady lock-on
     tone. Hear any beeps? You're in trouble- somebody's REALLY got their eye
     on you- that's a missile warning. Hit the flares and break hard right or








     left- or even up if you're desperate. Trade altitude for speed to shake off
     any annoying bogies- though the F-16 and it's counterparts won't be held off
     for long by doing this. Most important lesson: hit any bandits QUICKLY, or
     you won't be around to try again! If you think you have the time, try using
     the enemy aircraft view- the position your plane is shown in will help you
     find the enemy. Finally, never underestimate your opponent, or the risk of
     collision. A collision is NOT an unlikely event- keep an eye on the radar at
     all times. If he's getting close, dive as steeply as possible (or climb with
     afterburner). A tip: if you're out of missiles and cannon, just keep using
     flares and go home. The enemy will exhaust his missile supply and just follow
     you to annoy you. Then the only risk is that he'll try a kamikaze run on you!

     WEAPON DELIVERY
     Pretty straight forward- only bombs, JP-233 and ALARMs seem to tricky to
     use. The JP-233 spreads it's bomblets well ahead of the point you release
     it, depending on your airspeed. Use satellite view on free flight mode to
     practice using it successfully. The standard unguided bombs are much the
     same, but require even greater accuracy. The ALARM (much like the real
     thing I'm told), is pretty useless. You've got to within 3 miles of an
     active radar, and you have to use it like a rocket pod- point the plane
     at the target and then release the weapon. Only use the ALARM if you
     can't afford a Maverick! Mavericks really are useful- flying at around 500 ft,
     they can be locked on to a target at around 16 miles, and fired immediately.
     Then you can turn away and forget about it! If all else fails, go for a low
     speed, low altitude pass with your cannon centred on the target, and let rip.
     The cannon is remarkably good at it's job in this game!

     Air to air weapons are different- the cannon is used in much the same way,
     but I wouldn't advise getting that close to a bandit because of the collision
     risk. Instead, take him out with a Sidewinder (or equivalent). Press S to lock
     on to the target, manoeuvre so he's in your sights, wait for the circle to
     lock on the target square, and when the circle is red and you get a steady
     lock-on tone, hit fire. Splash one MiG! (Or whatever...)
