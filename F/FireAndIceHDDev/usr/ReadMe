 This install applies to "Fire And Ice" © 1990-1994 Graftgold

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 Floppy version:

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 There's a version which only requires 512kb ChipMem and 24-bit othermem (game
 doesn't like 32-bit memory at all)
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 CD³² version:

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 - ECS: added delay on "Cool Coyote" screen (skip with fire button)

   (Extra buttons beside red button didn't work beside other bad stuff with 1B A1200 motherboards)

 - CD32 version second button jump & higher level trainers directly activable from splash screen

 version 2.1 (2007)
 - CD³² version install fixed, no longer requires lowlevel.library,
   keyboard now works 100%, so does joypad & joystick emulation.
 - You can select J-8 controller (joypad) if you use a 2-button joystick
   so 2nd button works as the blue button (jump)
 - Joypad emulation keys:
   * P: pause the game
   * ESC: quit the game while in pause
   * SPACE: special weapon
 - reworked readme file (I think this is the final release of the slave!)

 version 2.0

   (there are 2 versions of the slave, one needing lowlevel and the other not, but
   with buggy keyboard & joystick controls)

Notes from original Ralf JST installer:

One of the best jump and run games ever - on any platform. Patched to run
from your harddisk in one day. One of Andrew Braybrook's greatest
games - runs now on the A1200 HD. Have fun!

Seeing the code, it's a miracle that we could patch it. Andrew Braybrook
code is very compact and obfuscated, with register-relative accesses, bit fields,
weird optimizations...
It's the main reason why I didn't add levelskip but only a "exit-when-you-want" option.

Many thanks to Carlo Pirri for sending me the original from
Australia!

The game has been sucessfully tested with an Amiga1200 030/50Mhz/18MB
with a Blizzard 1230/IV and an Amiga 1200 030/28Mhz/12MB, and with
a A1200 060/50MHz/64MB with a Blizzard 1260/IV.
