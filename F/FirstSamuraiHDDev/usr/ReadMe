 That install applies to "First Samurai" Â© 1991 Vivid Image.

 To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
 installation mode.
 
 You need 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 You can quit the game by pressing Help (key can be changed with
 Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly

History:
		  
 Version 2.0 (31.08.2019) done by JOTD (features added only for ECS original)
 - CUSTOM3=1 forces introduction skip (which could be achieved by holding fire...)

   Adding CUSTOM1 option enables more than one. 255 enables all options.

   Just press F1-F10 to reach corresponding level

 - password screen completely removed
 - added joypad controls (see full details at the end of the document)
 - added ESC key to quit current game (could not quit from pause, even if the manual says so)
 - reworked source code, source included, see how much control tweaks were added for joypad :)
 
 Version 1.6 (22.12.2010) Harry/Wepl
 - max volume for channel 4 fixed (issue #2260)
 - highscores will now be saved to a separate file instead into the
   second disk image
 - keyboard acknowledge delay fixed
 - v10 slave infos added
 - new install script
 - manual, solution and icons added
 
 Version 1.5 (30.03.1999) and all previous versions by Mr.Larmer/Wanted Team
 
 
 To our (Harry/Wepl) knowledge there exists no AGA release of this game.
 We think the game version Mr.Larmer refers to was probably a crack or
 aga-fix. The changes made with this update apply only to the original
 version.
 
 Update: http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=73962
 A A1200-compatible version was released. But it's the same as standard ECS version, with
 built-in AGA fixes
	
 Joypad controls: the game recieved special treatment to be able to played/saved
 all parts completely without the keyboard
 
 Joypad controls - Game:
 - FWD+REV+PLAY: quit to workbench
 - PLAY: pause (fire to unpause)
 - FWD+REV: quit current game
 - GREEN: enables bell
 - BLUE: jump (if jump option selected)
 
 Joypad controls - Menu:
 - FWD+REV+PLAY: quit to workbench
 - YELLOW: shows level selection menu

 Joypad controls - Level menu:
 - FWD+REV+PLAY: quit to workbench
 - YELLOW: save positions (level menu) ("S" key)
 - BLUE: select current level
 - FWD: forward one level (screen flashes green)
 - REV: back one level (screen flashes red)
 
 So pressing 2 times "FWD" then "BLUE" selects level 3. Wraps to 1 when reaches 10
 
 Joypad controls - Hiscore menu:
 - FWD+REV+PLAY: quit to workbench
 - BLUE: simulate ENTER (so no keyboard is required at all)

 Note: if you have a 2-button joystick (and not a joypad), blue button will still work
