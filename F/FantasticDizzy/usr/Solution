Welcome to the Fantastic Dizzy walkthrough and strategy guide.

This guide contains everything you will need to make your way through the only
Dizzy game on the 16-bit console. If you are a fan of Dizzy's earlier games,
such as Magicland Dizzy and Spellbound Dizzy, then you'll probably love this
game. It has all the puzzles and arcade action of the originals, yet in a full-
colour format with more than one music theme. In addition, it also brings many
of the aspects of the 64K and 128K games into one epic adventure, meaning that
you'll meet many old allies and adversaries from those games, and solve a host
of familiar puzzles. This guide takes you through the entire journey, including
the locations of all 250 Magic Stars and tips on getting past difficult areas.
The first part of the guide explains how to play the game, and following this
is the walkthrough itself. At the end is an appendix, containing a list of all
the items in the game of all the Magic Star and Magic Scroll locations.

Ready? Then let's begin!

Dizzy is an egg living in a world of magic and fantasy. Throughout the various
original games we learned more about Dizzy, his friends and his enemies, and as
the size of the world of Dizzy grew, so did the games.

The basic concept of the game is to move around the world, finding various
items and collectibles, and to use them in the right locations. Dizzy has no
special skills or abilities, save for his remarkable feats of somersaulting,
and must solve all problems he faces with the clever use of one or more items.

Many of the aspects of Dizzy are based around fairy tales, folklore and common
sense. Combining knowledge of myths and stories with observation and a generous
helping of lateral thinking is the key to winning through. If you would rather
not use the walkthrough directly, try looking closely at the items you have and
working out for what they could be used. Let me give you an example from one of
the earlier games - in this case, Magicland Dizzy:

There is a troll guarding a bridge, demanding a toll of 30 Diamonds. After
searching high and low for this quantity, you still fall short by quite a large
amount. There is a goat tethered to a pole near the troll, but it doesn't seem
to do anything. Checking your available items, you see that you have a cloth,
a gold cross, a wooden stick, an 'eat-me' cake, a dagger and a handle, amongst
other things. As the goat is tethered to the pole, it isn't going anywhere on
its own. Using the dagger cuts the rope, but the goat refuses to move. So, use
the stick to hit the goat and it runs across the bridge and knocks the troll
into the water. This is the only way to solve the puzzle, as quite a few of
the 30 Diamonds in the game are on the other side of the bridge, and they all
have a far more important purpose.

Put simply, all the puzzles in the game have logical solutions. It is simply a
matter of thinking of different possibilities using the clues available. If you
really get stuck, you can refer to the Items list to discover each item's
purpose. Otherwise, you can just follow the walkthrough. I am pretty certain it
is one of the most efficient ways, in terms of time, to complete the game.

Select the language you wish to use (English probably, as you are reading this
guide). The title screen appears, so press Start to begin the game. You are
given a short introduction:

"Daisy has been captured by the evil wizard Zaks. Only Dizzy is brave and
 clever enough to rescue her from a terrible fate. Leaving the safety of the
 Yolkfolk's treehouse village, Dizzy sets out on his greatest adventure!"

The game then begins.

This walkthrough is divided into acts, each covering a portion of the game. The
acts are further divided into numbered sections, each section representing all
of the actions to be carried out in a particular area before going to the next
area. As you will need to go back and forth quite frequently to master this
game, the section numbers are given to make keeping track much easier. Note
that the current area changes when you go through a door or go up or down out
of the screen. If you get stuck, use the world map given below:

getting to grips with the game and preparing ourselves for later challenges.

Home sweet home! You are in your very own treehouse hut, carrying

Walk left and jump onto the table to collect the first Magic Star (249). Jump
up onto the cabinet to the right and then into the rafters to pick up 'Dizzy's
door key'. Hop onto the smaller cabinet to grab another Magic Star (248). Drop
down off the left side of the cabinet to avoid getting burnt, then head right
to the door. Use 'Dizzy's door key' to open the door, then head outside.

You're on some familiar paths through the village, near your own hut, with

Go left and jump to collect the Magic Star (247), then head a little further
and under the spider as it ascends. Grab the Magic Star (246) and 'The key for
Denzil's elevator' at the end, then walk back and pick up 'A large strong plank
of wood'. Continue right past your hut. You may notice a purple animal running
around on this level. Don't worry - this is Pogie the fluffle, and it won't
hurt you. In fact, you'll find it essential later in the game. Jump up to grab
a Magic Star (245), then walk under the spider that follows. Drop to the ledge
below and drop 'The key for Denzil's elevator', then turn left and head down to
the next screen.

You are at the base of the Yolkfolk's secret treehouse village, carrying

> A large strong plank of wood


Continue left and jump to grab a Magic Star (244). Drop down to the floor and
head left to pick up 'The key for the ground elevator'. Return to the elevator
and drop 'A large strong plank of wood'. Use 'The key for the ground elevator'
on the elevator and you will be taken back to the platform above. Descend back
down to the floor and pick up 'A large strong plank of wood'.

Head right, being careful to avoid the spider. When you reach the edge of a pit
of spikes, use 'A large strong plank of wood' to create a bridge over. Walk
across, collecting a Magic Star (243) as you do so, then continue along the
grass. Jump to collect the Magic Star (242), avoiding the snail, then collect
another Magic Star (241) near the spider. A little further, watch out for the
snail as you grab a third Magic Star (240), then continue right and down to the
next area below.

Drop down the hill, ignoring the entrance to the mine on the left. Keep going
right past the spider, then jump to grab the Magic Star (239) between the snail
and the butterfly. Walk over the bridge and collect another Magic Star (238) a
little further on. Dodge the spider and step onto the jutting rock to pick up
'A machine wrench'. Turn around and head back across the bridge, and pick up 'A
red and white mushroom' on the other side. Continue all the way to the left and
head down into the mine, grabbing the Magic Star (237) as you go.

> Dora who has been turned into a frog!                          49 Magic Stars
> A small pigmy cow
> A long length of tough rope


Pick up 'A tender joint of cooked ham' (dropping 'A long length of tough rope'
automatically). Drop 'A small pigmy cow' as well, then walk to the right. There
is a rather burly man standing in front of a ladder. Address the Prince:

"The prince kisses the frog and instantly Dora returns. He is so pleased he
 gives you his crossbow."

Pick up 'A crossbow with lots of bolts', then return back to the left. Pick up
'A long length of tough rope' and jump to grab the Magic Star (200). You are
now about to leave the first section of the game, so make sure you've followed
this walkthrough exactly. If not, certain items may not be in certain locations
later, making things extra difficult. Go left and out of the village.

This next section of the game covers most of the events that take place in and
around Keldor, a village to the west of the Yolkfolk treehouse complex. The map
below is taken directly from the one given in the tunnels of Keldor, allowing
you to find your way around the village more easily:

Near the dangerous but glorious Crystal Falls of Swift River, carrying

> A long length of tough rope                                    50 Magic Stars
> A crossbow with lots of bolts
> A tender joint of cooked ham


Walk to the left and collect the Magic Star (199). Continue left down the rocks
and stop just as you pass the tree. Drop 'A tender joint of cooked ham' and
it will be thrown out of view to the left. The reason for this is that there
was a large boar lurking to the left, which would have charged at you if you
hadn't thrown 'A tender joint of cooked ham' to distract it. Luckily, the boar
is gone now, and you will never see it again.

Continue to the left, jumping to procure a Magic Star (198), and keep going
until you are between two jagged rocks. Pick up 'A heavy bag of gold coins' and
jump for the Magic Star (197). Walk left past the spider, and jump for another
Magic Star (196). Wait at the edge of the waterfall and a barrel will fall down
the first cascade. Once the barrel appears at the edge of the second (it will
be larger), jump onto it and then off to the other side. Take advantage of the
Magic Scroll waiting for you, then head left to obtain the Magic Star (195).
Continue to the left and jump up the rocks to leave the area.

On Castle Street, where you'll find the shopkeeper, carrying

> A long length of tough rope
> A crossbow with lots of bolts


Welcome to the village of Keldor. Jump up and grab the Magic Star (194), then
head to the left. There is 'A protective old umbrella' here, but don't pick it
up. Although it stops you getting hurt by acid drops, it has no purpose in the
story, and will just use up a valuable item slot. Instead, go through the door
nearest to you.

In a spooky tunnel between Castle Street and Bridge Street, carrying

> A heavy bag of gold coins                                      56 Magic Stars
> A long length of tough rope
> A crossbow with lots of bolts


Walk to the left and stop just before the troll Guard. Make sure you don't get
too close or he will painfully throw you across the room. Jump to grab a Magic
Star (193), then drop and pick up through the inventory until you use 'A heavy
bag of gold coins'. You throw the bag into the air and the Guard catches it.
Seemingly pleased with this toll (or bribe?), the Guard backs away into the
left doorway. Wait until he has disappeared, then walk through the left door.

> A long length of tough rope
> A crossbow with lots of bolts


Jump left to collect the Magic Star (192), then drop 'A crossbow with lots of
bolts'. There is a guillotine to the right that constantly falls and raises.
Wait until the blade has just fallen (it won't hurt unless it's falling), then
pass by. Jump over the rat and collect the Magic Star (191), then pick up 'A
barrel of pirates rum'.

Head back left past the doorway, minding the rats and the guillotine, then jump
up for another Magic Star (190). Go a bit further to the left, minding the rat
as you head to the centre of the bridge. Pick up 'A very strong crowbar',
dropping 'A crossbow with lots of bolts' at the same time. Return right back to
the door, then go into the tunnel again.

Be very careful of all four rats in this tunnel as you make your way from right
to left, jumping to collect the Magic Star (188) as you go.

Walk left across the bridge, hopping over the rat, then jump towards the wall
to grab a Magic Star (187). Head back to the right, past the doorway, then jump
up for another Magic Star (186). Keep going right until you reach Blackheart
blocking the path. Jump to collect a Magic Star (185), then drop and pick up 'A
long length of tough rope'. Use 'A barrel of pirates rum' to throw it over to
Blackheart. He seems pleased, and runs up the gangplank to the ship behind him.
Follow him up onto the pirate vessel.

Go to the right a little and stand in the middle of the trapdoor. Use 'A very

the bridge and pick up 'A crossbow with lots of bolts', then pick up 'A long
length of tough rope' that you drop automatically. This should leave 'Zaks'
portcullis winch handle' behind. Go left and jump into the wall to grab the
Magic Star (174), then head through the door.

doorway on the left, collecting the Magic Star (173) as you go. If you are very
lucky, you may get away with no damage, but it is very unlikely.

Castle Seige Mini-Game                                                     2.23

The style of play changes dramatically here. You will be facing a large castle
on the other side of a moat. Dizzy will appear at the bottom of the screen
armed with his crossbow, and a Status bar will appear beneath him. The bar
contains eight segments, four of which are lit when you start. A clock will
also appear in the top-right corner, indicating you have two minutes. The aim
of this little mini-game is to get the Status bar fully lit, and this is done
by shooting the soldiers that appear around the castle. The soldiers will not
be helpless though, and will throw rocks at Dizzy. As soon as the crosshair
appears in the middle of the screen, the seige begins:

Move the crosshair around the screen using the D-Pad. It will shake slightly to
indicate how difficult it is to use a crossbow while wearing boxing gloves.

Press 'C' to fire a bolt. If you hit a soldier, you gain one point on the
Status bar.

Press 'B' to duck. If a rock comes flying you way, quickly duck until the rock
has flown past. If you are hit, you lose one point on the Status bar.

If your Status bar is filled, Dizzy will back away and appear on the other side
of the moat. He enters the castle. Continue from the next section.

If your Status bar is emptied or the time runs out, Dizzy is defeated and loses
one life. You appear back in Castle Street, and will have to try again.

Probably the best way to tackle this area is to constantly duck while moving
the crosshair around. As soon as you acquire a target, quickly get up and fire
before ducking again. Doing this, you take a little bit longer firing at the
soldiers but are guaranteed not to get hit. This mini-game is pretty easy, and
you shouldn't have too much trouble getting through. If you have enough lives
to spare, it is quite entertaining to watch Dizzy crack from the rocks, but I
wouldn't recommend doing this. You've got a long way to go yet.

> A crossbow with lots of bolts


You must be very careful not to leave 'A crossbow with lots of bolts' anywhere
in this castle. If you leave without it, and later discover that you have left
something important in the castle, there is no way you can get back in. Just
make sure you have 'A crossbow with lots of bolts' before you leave.

Anyway, head left and jump onto the chair, grabbing a Magic Star (167) as you
do so. Hop onto the ledge on the left, then walk across and drop down onto the
floor, being careful of the rat. Keep going left, jumping to avoid the rat and
collect a Magic Star (166), then onto the chair.

Jump to the left to grab the Magic Star (165), then wait next to the spider.
When it descends, jump over and drop into the small alcove at the bottom to
procure another Magic Star (164). Quickly jump back to the ledge before the rat
comes along, then jump to the platform on the left. Jump back to the right to
grab a Magic Star (163), then jump right as if onto the ledge that is in the
screen above.

The third section of the game is set mainly under the sea and in the Diamond
Mines below the Yolkfolk village. This section begins with a mini-game very
similar to Bubble Dizzy, after which it's business as usual.

Chasm of Bubbles                                                           3.01
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

In true pirate fashion, Blackheart slowly forces Dizzy off the edge, but Dizzy
just manages to grab on to the plank. An Oxygen gauge is filling while this is
happening, and after jumping up and down Blackheart eventually gets Dizzy to
let go. He falls all the way to the bottom of the chasm, then the game begins.

You have to get back to the surface before the Oxygen gauge is depleted. This
is achieved by making use of bubbles that rise up from the floor. You have to
jump onto a bubble in order to let it carry you upwards. The bubbles vary in
size, speed and strength, and will pop after Dizzy has stood on them for a
certain period of time. The idea is to jump from bubble to bubble, before they
pop and cause Dizzy to fall back down. There are also 10 Magic Stars to be
collected in this chasm. Make sure you don't leave until the number 129 appears
after collecting the last Magic Star. Although you can come back here anytime,
it saves a lot of hassle later if you grab all the Magic Stars now.

You have about 135 seconds to reach the top, or you will drown and lose a life.
Once you reach the surface of the water, jump out onto the sand on the right.
You will need to get quite a good height out of the water in order to reach it.
Head right and you will be taken to the next area.

While you are carrying 'An aqua lung for under water', you will not drown. If
you are not carrying this important item, however, after a few seconds of

Jump up onto the beach, then again to collect the Magic Star (127). Continue to
the left until you reach 'A heavy duty rustproof pickaxe', then drop both items
in your inventory. Pick up 'A heavy duty rustproof pickaxe' and then the other
two items, then head back right and drop back into the sea.

this clam is harmless. Go back to the right, then down the hill to the bottom.

You will probably roll straight down and grab the Magic Star (124) before you
stop, after which you should quickly head back left to avoid the swordfish
soaring around. Head up the rocks and then down the other side to the left, and
grab the Magic Star (123) at the bottom. Jump between the crab and the yellow
fish, then collect another Magic Star (122) at the end. Head back to the right
and up the rocks again.

Continue to the right, past the swordfish, and jump onto the rocks. Grab the
Magic Star (121), then jump off to the right. Jump onto the ship wreck, then
over to the right and onto the beam above to grab a Magic Star (120). Drop off
to the right and pick up 'An empty treasure chest', then drop down to the floor
again, grabbing a Magic Star (119) as you fall. From the exact point that you
land, use 'A heavy duty rustproof pickaxe' to remove the large rock below.

Head right, being careful of the crab and the yellow fish, and collect a Magic
Star (118) at the end. Go back to the hole you made, and wait until a bubble
just begins to rise. Jump onto it and then wait until it reaches the ledge
above. Jump off to the right to grab a Magic Star (117), then head up to the
left to go into the area above.

By some geographical oddity you are now in the Diamond Mines near a mine cart
to the left. Don't approach this yet, or you'll be carried off to some other
area. Instead, go right past the acid drip, and jump up to the rocks ahead,
grabbing the Magic Star (111) as you go. Drop to the right and collect another
Magic Star (110), then head right past the two acid drips. Try to get past the
bird without getting hurt (not easy), then walk under another acid drip to the
elevator. Continue past the elevator, the spider and the acid drip all the way
to the end, where you can obtain a Magic Star (109). Go back left to the
elevator and take it down to the floor below.

Go right to collect a Magic Star (108), then head back left. Jump over the
crate ahead and grab another Magic Star (107). Mind the acid drip as you keep
going left, and be wary of the spider near the end. Pick up 'A bridgebuiler's
sharp axe', then pick up 'A dry match' that you drop automatically. Leave 'Some
sticks of dynamite' here, and go back right all the way to the elevator. Take
the elevator back up, then head left to the large rock. Jump up to it, then
leap left up to the area above.

This little mini-game is quite enjoyable. The idea is to steer the little mine
cart at each junction you come to, avoiding trolls, rocks and barriers. There
are 20 Magic Stars up for grabs in this area, all of which are obtainable in
one full run-through. The map below gives the layout of the entire network,
including the positions of the obstacles and Magic Stars. Start from the bottom
left corner and work your way up, moving to the next section when you reach the
top. There are four different exits from the network, but in this particular
instance you should aim for the very last one (marked D on the map). Make sure,
on this occasion, that you collect as many Magic Stars as possible, especially
those after exit C. We will be going through here again, although on the second
visit we will be taking the third exit, so you'll have another chance to obtain
any Magic Stars you missed before this. Good luck!

         Start


If you hit a troll, boulder or barrier, you lose a life and restart back near
the mine cart in the Diamond Mines. If you accidentally take one of the first
three exits, you will have to make your way back to the mine cart and try
again. Once you have made it through to exit D (hopefully, with an extra 20
Magic Stars), you will be in a tunnel on the far left of Bridge Street.

Drop down to the right and pick up 'A gravediggers muddy spade'. Head right and
wait until the rat below moves to the left. Drop to the floor, grabbing a Magic
Star (58) on the way, then head right and jump out of the tunnel. Hop over to
the steps, then head left and up into the area above.

Head left and pick up 'A key with a skull motif'. Continue left until you reach
a dip in the ground just below the bridge. Drop both the items you are carrying
near the other items, then stand directly above the dip. Use 'A gravediggers
muddy spade' and you will dig a hole down to the area below, to which you fall.

This area is filled with acid drips. Be very careful when moving about, and try
to time your walking and jumping effectively. Drop down to the left and then
jump to the next ledge above the pool nearby. Head to the left and pick up 'A
gymnasts bouncy trampet', then jump to the ledge near the top to grab a Magic
Star (57). Drop to the platform on the left then jump into the wall to collect
another Magic Star (56).

Go back to the right and jump across the ledges until you arrive back at the
ledge you first landed on. Pick up 'An empty bucket', then drop 'A gymnasts
bouncy trampet' to replace it. Next, drop down to the right to grab a Magic
Star (55). Step into the pool and drop 'An empty bucket' to fill it with water.
Pick up 'A bucket full of water', then jump to the ledge on the left and up to
the right onto the top ledge. Jump onto 'A gymnasts bouncy trampet' and hold
left to spring back up to the graveyard above.

Once you land, pick up 'A solid gold Irish shamrock' and 'A long length of
tough rope', then head left and jump to collect the Magic Star (54). Hop over
the snail to the left, then continue to grab another Magic Star (53). Jump onto
the ledge to the left, then up to the next one and onto the top to obtain the
Magic Star (52). Drop back down and grab yet another Magic Star (51). Go all
the way to the left, past the snail, and jump for the last Magic Star (50),
before going down to the grasslands.

The final section of the game consists of wrapping up the last few bits and
pieces. This will involve a lot of travelling around all the different areas,
and making use of the last items to get into and through Zaks' castle. It is
here that we will collect the remaining Magic Stars, and ultimately rescue
Daisy from the evil wizard.

The fact that you are back here will alert you to the looping nature of this
world. Head left and jump over the snail to grab a Magic Star (49). Continue
left and pass another snail to drop into the cave beyond, collecting another
Magic Star (48) en route. Jump out to the left, then drop 'A bucket full of
water'. Approach Shamus the leprechaun and give him 'A solid gold Irish
shamrock'. Pleased with your gift, Shamus leaps over you and into the cave
below. Drop 'A long length of tough rope' to clear your inventory.

Head left, past the spider, all the way to the broken bridge. Drop down and
jump up to the other side, then continue left and down to Carber Bay.

Walk left along the beach and pick up 'An aqua lung for under water' and 'A
pair of flippers for swimming'. Dive into the water and swim left, over the two
islands, until you reach the beach on the other side. Drop 'An aqua lung for
under water' and 'A pair of flippers for swimming', then head left and up to
the countryside above.

Make your way left through the graveyard and hop over the hole in the ground.

The white fluffy clouds manage to support Dizzy's weight momentarily, but he
will slowly drop through them if he lingers too long. A lot of jumping is
required on the clouds to prevent Dizzy from falling straight through.

Jump to the cloud on the right, grabbing a Magic Star (36) on the way, then
leap over the butterfly to collect another Magic Star (35) on the cloud nearby.
Jump back over the butterfly, and down to the cloud by the beanstalk. Hop over
to the cloud on the left, then across and onto the next one. Jump to the cloud
just above, procuring a Magic Star (34) in the process, then over to the right
cloud above. Walk across and hop to the next cloud, then continue past the
beanstalk. Jump to the small cloud on the right when the butterfly is out of
the way, then across to the top cloud. Jump up to the area above, grabbing the
Magic Star (33) as you do so.

Hop straight up to the cloud above, then over to the one on the left. Jump to
the cloud high up on the right, and mind the butterfly as you grab the Magic
Star (32). Jump back to the lower cloud and across the beanstalk to the one to
the left of it. Leap to the cloud nearby to collect another Magic Star (31),
then jump over the butterfly to the next one. Drop all the way down to the
cloud at the bottom on the left, then hop over to the one following. Jump past
the butterfly to the left, grabbing a Magic Star (30) on the way, and land on
a long cloud. This cloud is firm, and you will not fall through. You could
probably guess that from the weight of the huge castle that it is supporting
behind you. Go to the far left and collect the Magic Star (29), then go back
and use 'Zaks' portcullis winch handle' to open the gate. Head inside.

Dizzy walks in from the bottom left, and the screen scrolls upwards to show the
trial ahead of you. At the top, Daisy is trapped on a ledge calling for help,
and Zaks is beneath her. He begins to fire molten rocks down the steps below,
and the screen scrolls back to the bottom. You can now control Dizzy.

The idea here is very simple - to get to the top of the tower. The movement of
Dizzy is slightly different here. He moves more slowly and his jumps are lower
and more jerky. Simply jump from step to step, avoiding the molten rocks that
fall from above, until you reach the top. It is possible that you may lose a
life or two here, but fortunately you will reappear in the same place you died
if this happens.

Once you reach the top of the tower, quickly head over to the mirror on the
right and wait. Zaks will shoot a blast of energy directly at Dizzy. Jump just
before it reaches you and the energy will reflect from the mirror and back into
Zaks. After he explodes, make your way over to where he stood and jump up to
Daisy on the ledge above. Dizzy kisses her, and the game is complete.

The credits roll.

There are five Magic Scrolls located around the world, and examining them takes
you to a little bonus game where you can win an extra life. A picture of Dizzy
and the good wizard Theo appears, after which the image splits into sixteen
pieces and is shuffled around. Dizzy is pacing about on the grass beneath the
image while this is happening. After a short while, the shuffling stops and the
puzzle begins.

Move the cursor around with the D-Pad and hold 'A', 'B' or 'C' to lock on to
one of the tiles. Once a tile is locked, push the D-Pad towards the piece you
want to swap it with, and the two tiles will be exchanged. Move around the

You have a pretty safe 95 seconds to complete this task, else the screen clears
and you return to the game. If you succeed, Theo jumps in and casts a spell
upon Dizzy. This causes Dizzy to split into two - an extra life. After the two
Dizzys walk off the screen, the normal game is resumed.

Every item in the game is listed here, including the locations found and the
functions they serve. Due to the nature of the descriptions, alphabetical order
is a little difficult to use, so I've listed the items in the order that they
are first acquired in the game. There is also a summary of the locations of all
five Magic Scrolls, should you need them.

The links show some of the original games upon which aspects of Fantastic Dizzy
are based. I may have missed a few, as I cannot clearly remember all of the
games exactly. It's been many years since I last played the old Dizzy games.
I have also included hints for each item to explain how the item itself gives
clues as to where or on what it should be used.

   Function: Allows Dizzy to swing across large gaps by pressing 'B' - only
             works on hooks hanging above

             This item does not need to be used - it functions by just being
             in the inventory

   Link:     None

   Hint:     Some of the large gaps have hooks above them, and the description
             states that the item is tough


A pile of dry straw

   Function: Must be placed near Denzil and ignited to thaw him out

   Link:     Prince of the Yolkfolk (although cheese must be used as bait)

             difficult to catch with boxing gloves

   Location: Treehouse Village - First Floor, once you've captured Pogie

   Function: Give to Dylan in return for 'A small pigmy cow'

   Link:     Prince of the Yolkfolk (exactly the same)

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Graveyard, only accessible after building a bridge to it

   Function: Switches on the elevator in Zaks' castle

   Link:     None

   Hint:     The fact that this key has a skull means it is probably usable in
             an unfriendly place, and the elevator in Zaks' castle doesn't work

   Location: Pirate Ship - Lower Deck, on the far right of the area

   Location: Carber Bay - Above Water, on the small island in the middle

   Location: Carber Bay - Deep Under Water, on the shipwreck

   Function: Usable as a step to reach Grasslands of Shamus from Carber Bay

   Link:     Treasure Island Dizzy (exactly the same)

   Hint:     The cliff on the right of Camber Bay is too high to jump, although
             a sturdy step would make it easier


A large bag of salt
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Carber Bay - Above Water, on the beach on the right of the area

   Function: Increases density of water in the grasslands so the log rises up

   Link:     Fantasy World Dizzy (although rocks are used to raise water level)

   Hint:     A little physics required here - there is a log at the bottom of a
             small pool of water, and salt increases water density


A dry match
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Grasslands of Shamus, between the pool and Shamus

   Function: Lights 'A pile of dry straw' to thaw out Denzil

   Link:     Magicland Dizzy (although hot water is used to thaw him out)

   Location: Diamond Mines - Second Level, on the far left of the area

   Function: Cuts through the bridge in the countryside

   Link:     Treasure Island Dizzy (exactly the same)

             in any other way - this axe is designed for bridges


A pair of flippers for swimming
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Denzil's Pad, after thawing out Denzil

   Function: Allows Dizzy to swim about underwater by pressing 'C'

             This item does not need to be used - it functions by just being
             in the inventory

   Link:     Spellbound Dizzy (exactly the same)

   Hint:     Fairly obvious


A pair of brass cymbals
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Diamond Mines - First Level, in the water right of the machine

   Function: The loud noise wakes up Dozy

   Link:     Magicland Dizzy (although a lightning bolt is used)

   Function: Give to Shamus to allow you access to the special soil

   Link:     Spellbound Dizzy (although Shamus gives you an item in return)

   Hint:     Leprechauns are an Irish myth, and there is one particular
             leprechaun who may need to be persuaded to move


A gravediggers muddy spade
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Keldor - Bridge Street, on the far left of the area

   Function: Digs a hole in the middle of the graveyard

   Link:     Treasure Island Dizzy (exactly the same)

   Hint:     The description suggests it should be used in the graveyard,
             and there is already a dip with a pile of mud next to it


A gymnasts bouncy trampet
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Subterranean Cave, on a ledge in the left part of the cave

   Function: Springs Dizzy high into the air to get out of the cave

   Link:     Spellbound Dizzy (exactly the same)

   Hint:     The exit from the cave is too high to reach by jumping alone


An empty bucket
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Subterranean Cave, on a ledge in the right part of the cave

   Function: Fill with water to create 'A bucket full of water'

   Link:     Fantasy World Dizzy (exactly the same)
             Magicland Dizzy (exactly the same)

   Function: Douses the flame in Zaks' castle

   Link:     Fantasy World Dizzy (although used to grow the beanstalk)
             Magicland Dizzy (although filled with hot water to melt Denzil)

   Hint:     The large fire in Zaks' castle needs to be passed


A thick Persian rug
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Dozy's Hut, after waking him up with 'A pair of brass cymbals'

   Function: Covers the row of spikes in Zaks' castle

   Link:     Fantasy World Dizzy (exactly the same)

   Hint:     There is a row of spikes that cannot be jumped over, and there
             is no hook to swing across either


A magic green bean
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Location: Keldor - Castle Street, as payment from the Merchant for either
             'A small pigmy cow' or 'A large gold coin'

   Function: Sprouts into a beanstalk in the special soil in the grasslands

   Link:     Fantasy World Dizzy (although the bean needs to be watered)

   Hint:     This should be planted, and the sign with the bean on it gives a
             good clue as to where

Me

Jonathan Mathews' ASCII Generator

At the moment, I don't really have anyone else to thank for helping me make
this walkthrough (apart from the creators of Fantastic Dizzy at Codemasters and
Sega for producing and publishing this excellent game). This is mainly because
it was written entirely by myself. I alone have scribed the lengthy walkthrough
and strategies. No other resource, save for the ASCII Generator and Fantastic
Dizzy itself, has been used in the creation of this guide.

Any additional information or rectification of mistakes will earn credit for
their source in future versions. This section will then have some use.

I am perfectly happy for this guide to be used on anyone's sites, so long as my
permission is first obtained. Please do not remove, amend or add anything from
this guide. If you feel something needs to be changed, please e-mail me at
either address below and I will make appropriate adjustments.
