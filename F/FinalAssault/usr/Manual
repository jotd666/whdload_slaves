                        THE ADVENTURE OF A LIFETIME

You're  in the Alps,  ready to start off on an  expedition to  the  highest 
peaks  of Europe.   And you're going to do it the hard  way,  avoiding  the 
easy,  well-marked  tourist trails with their ladders and  handholds.   The 
more risky and difficult the route,  the greater the challenge.  That's why 
you're here.

Before  you  go,  you  think  back over the  history  of  the  Alps,  where 
mountaineering began.   This great mountain chain runs through the heart of 
Europe,  beginning on the French Riviera and passing through France, Italy, 
Switzerland,  and Germany before coming to an end in northeastern  Austria.  
The best climbing is between Chamonix,  in France,  and Innsbruck, near the 
German border in Austria.

Right  outside  of  Chamonix is Mont Blanc,  at  4807  meters  the  highest 
mountain  in  western  Europe.   To the east is the great  pyramid  of  the 
Matterhorn,  one  of  the  most famous mountains  in  the  world.   To  the 
northeast stand the Monch and the Jungfrau - the Monk and the Virgin.  Near 
them is the Eiger, easily the most dangerous mountain in Europe.  This Ogre 
has claimed dozens of victims both before and after its "conquest" in 1938.

The Alps have towered over Europe since long before mankind arrived, but no 
one  tried  to  climb them until near the end of  the  eighteenth  century. 
Villages,  farms,  and monasteries sprung up at their feet,  and sheep  and 
cattle grazed in the lowland meadows.   Armies struggled through the  great 
passes to invade the countries beyond.   The Carthaginian general  Hannibal 
even  managed  to  drive  elephants  across  the  Alps  during  his  daring 
midwinter invasion of Italy in 218 BC.   (It took 17 years,  but the Romans 
won.)

On  a more peaceful note,  Leonardo da Vinci travelled widely  through  the 
Alps  on  meteorological expeditions.   But everyone stopped short  of  the 
summits,  and  as  late  as 1725 guides to  Switzerland  featured  detailed 
descriptions of the dragons believed to live on the mountaintops.

True mountaineering  had  to wait for the modern age,  with  its  drive  to 
understand  and explore.   In 1787 a wealthy scholar  from  Geneva,  Horace 
Benedict  de Saussure,  reached the summit of Mont Blanc at the head  of  a 
huge expedition that even included his valet.

The  French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars effectively closed  off  the 
Alps  for  the  next 30 years,  but after peace returned in  1815  an  ever 
increasing flood of adventurers began.   The year 1854 marked the beginning 
of the Golden Age of Mountaineering.   One after another,  the great  peaks 
were scaled, and at last, after seven failed tries and the death of four of 
his companions, Edward Whymper conquered the Matterhorn in 1865.

By  now  even  the great unclimbables,  such as the deadly  Eiger  and  the 
treacherous North Face of the Matterhorn,  have been scaled at least  once.  
But the Alps are still a climber's paradise.   You're up against  hazardous 
rock and unpredictable weather,  but if you plan well and climb skillfully, 
you'll earn yourself a place in the select company of Alpine conquerors.

     Mount Blanc and the Chamonix Pinnacles    4807m (15,767 ft.)
     Eiger    3971m (13,025 ft.)
     Monch    4099m (13,445 ft.)
     Jungfrau    4159m (13,642 ft.)
     Matterhorn    4479m (14,690 ft.)


                             LOADING THE GAME

     1.  Set up your system, following the instructions in your manual.
     2.  If you're using a joystick, plug it into joystick port 1.  If
         you're using a mouse, plug it into mouse/joystick port 0.
     3.  Insert the Final Assault disk into drive A, label side up, and
         turn on your system.
     4.  When the mountains appear, press Spacebar or your fire button to
         start the game.


                              GETTING STARTED

CHOOSING A ROUTE

It's  almost time to get started on your trek to the summit.   You'll  soon 
see the routes you can choose from.   Some are harder than others, but none 
of them are easy.   To begin,  make your selections from the dialog box  in 
the first game screen.

Disregard the Resume selection for now.   You'll use it later when you play 
a saved game.  (See the "Stopping and Saving" section for details.)

If you want to practice first,  press "T" (or move the pointer to  Training 
and press the fire button or Return).   The training trail is a real climb, 
with  a glacier to cross and a combination of ice and rock cliffs to  scale 
before  you  reach the summit.   You don't have to pack your  own  rucksack 
though, and you can follow the on-screen prompts to improve your technique.  
Best of all,  there are no fatal falls in training!   Try a training course 
first,  and you'll make it to the top - or at least live longer - when  you 
get out on your own.

If you're ready to go out on your own, decide how many routes to include in 
your  trek.   You can combine up to three at a time.   To select a  number, 
press the 1,  2,  or 3 key (or position the pointer on the number you  want 
and press the fire button or Return).

Now you can see the routes winding into the mountains.   Routes marked with 
a  circle are relatively easy to traverse;  those marked with a square  are 
intermediate;  and those marked with a diamond are the hardest.   Depending 
on the number you chose in the dialog box,  you can pick from one to  three 
routes in any combination.

     Route names:

     1.  Hat Trick                  4.  Footloose
     2.  Side-Burner                5.  Knucklehead
     3.  Edge of Fright             6.  Consider Me Gone

To select a route, move the pointer to its symbol and press the fire button 
or  Spacebar.   Now you can read its description.   You'll see the  route's 
name,  its total elevation gain in meters, the level of difficulty, and the 
estimated time it should take you to complete the climb.
Note:  You can also press keys 1 through 6 to select routes.

If  you want to accept the route,  press "Y" (or move the pointer  to  Yes, 
then  press  the  fire button or Return).   If you  don't  want  to  accept 
the route,  press "N" (or move the pointer to No and press the fire  button 
or Return).

If  you're selecting multiple routes,  repeat this process for  the  second 
(and third) route.   After selecting the last route,  you'll  automatically 
proceed to the supply screen where you'll pack your gear.

PACKING FOR THE TRAIL

You rucksack is automatically supplied with a basic selection of provisions 
and climbing gear, but it's smart to check it out before you accept it.  It 
may  not  contain everything you need,  or it may have things  you  can  do 
without.

You're the best judge of what you need.   If your trip is going to be long, 
for example,  you should pack more food.   On a short trip you might decide 
to  bring  more luxuries.   Just as in real life,  you may find  that  your 
packing ability gets better with experience.   To make sure that you  don't 
leave out anything essential,  go through the Packing List in this  section 
while you make your selections.

The  total  weight of your rucksack and rack (the climbing hear  you  carry 
outside your rucksack) can be seen in the upper left corner of the  screen.  
You  can  find  out what you're carrying by moving the  pointer  over  each 
article in your rucksack.   You'll see its name,  weight,  and how many  of 
that article you have.  The first layer you see includes the items that are 
packed  on  top.   To see the next layer,  select Next and press  the  fire 
button or Spacebar.

Note:  The rucksack icons include both rack and rucksack items.

If  you decide to accept the basic selection,  press "A" (or select  Accept 
and  press the fire button or Spacebar).   If you want to modify the  basic 
selection,  press  "R"  (or  select Refuse and press  the  fire  button  or 
Spacebar).

You'll  now  see all your potential choices laid out  for  you.   Move  the 
pointer  over  each article in turn.   Once again,  you'll  see  its  name, 
weight,  and how many you already have.   Press the fire button once to add 
one  of that item.   Press the fire button more than once to add more  than 
one.

To  see  additional items,  press "N" (or select Next under the  items  and 
press the fire button or Spacebar).

To take items out of your rucksack,  move the pointer over the item in  the 
rucksack.  On screen you'll see the item's name, weight, and number.  Press 
the  fire button to remove the item.   Press more than once to remove  more 
than one of the same item.  When all the items of one type are gone, you'll 
see whatever's on the next level.

As  you add and discard,  you'll see the weight of the rucksack  change  to 
keep track of your total.   Try to keep the weight to 25 kilograms or less.  
(A kilogram is 2.2 pounds.)  If you exceed this limit, you'll tire out more 
quickly  on  the  trek and you're more likely to slip on a  cliff  or  fall 
through the ice.

Once  you've packed the rucksack to your satisfaction press "D" (or  select 
Done and press the fire button or Spacebar).

SETTING YOUR DEPARTURE TIME

Set  your  departure  time  in the dialog  box  that  appears.   Trips  are 
automatically set for a 9 A.M.  start.  If that's OK, move the pointer over 
the time and press the fire button or Spacebar.   If you want to change the 
time,  move  the pointer to "+" or "-" and press the fire button  or  Space 
until  you see the 24-hour time you want.   Then move the pointer over  the 
time and press the fire button or Spacebar again.

You'll  now  see  a dialog box asking if you want to  leave  in  summer  or 
winter.  Choose your season by pressing "S" or "W" or by moving the pointer 
to  your selection and pressing the fire button or  Spacebar.   The  screen 
changes to bring you to the trailhead, ready to begin your climb.


                               ON THE TRAIL

HIKING AND JUMPING

Now  you're ready to head for the summit.   Begin walking at a steady  pace 
(see  the table below).   If the ground ahead looks unstable,  test  it  by 
poking it with your ice ax.   (By the way,  you always have your ice  axes.  
That's why they're not on the list).

Jump over crevasses.  If you make a mistake and fall, try to catch yourself 
with the same joystick or keyboard motion.   If you catch yourself,  or  if 
you fall all the way but survive, you'll have climb out.  Climbing out of a 
crevasse  is  the same as climbing an ice cliff,  so turn to  that  section 
(Climbing  on  Ice)  for advice on technique.   Once you  get back  on  the 
glacier, continue walking, but be more careful this time.

Test the ground.   Press fire button.        Press Spacebar.
Jump.              Push handle up.           Press up arrow.

USING YOUR SUPPLIES

To open your pack, press Return to bring the pointer onto the screen.  Move 
the  pointer  onto  the pack and press the fire  button  or  Return  again.  
You'll see a list of the pack's contents.   Push the joystick handle up and 
down or press the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the list.   When 
the article you want is highlighted,  press the fire button or Return.  You 
hear  a chime,  and the article disappears from the list (or you  have  one 
less of that type) because it's now outside the pack.

To  put  something back in the pack or to use any rack item  (such  as  the 
rope,  strap,  or  stirrups),  press  Return.   Move the pointer  onto  the 
climber's head and press the fire button or Spacebar.  You'll see a list of 
what  you're carrying.   Again,  use the joystick handle or arrow  keys  to 
scroll through the list.   When the article you want is highlighted,  press 
the fire button or Spacebar.   You hear a chime, and the article disappears 
from the list because you're now using it or it's back in the pack.
When you select some items,  either in your pack or on your body, you won't 
hear  the chime (but a tone will sound) and the items won't disappear  from 
the list.   These items are used automatically.   For example,  you have to 
have  pitons,  carabiners,  and a hammer to secure yourself with  the  rope 
while  you're climbing on rock.   But all you have to take out is the  rope 
itself.

BEGINNER'S LUCK

The first time you take what should have been a fatal fall, you'll see this 
message:  "You  were lucky this time.   Keep trying."  On an  easy  course, 
you'll get two,  and on a hard course,  just one.   You don't have to climb 
out when you're saved by luck.  Just press ESC.

CLIMBING ON ICE

Sooner or later, you'll come to your first ice cliff.  The best thing to do 
is  to  stop just before you get there,  open your pack,  and put  on  your 
crampons.  Then select a rope and proceed.

If  you find yourself on the cliff and you haven't had a chance to  put  on 
your crampons, play it safe and attach yourself to the wall with the strap.  
This  allows  you  to get into the pack  even  while  climbing.   Put  your 
crampons on, choose a rope, and proceed.  The strap automatically unfastens 
when you start moving.

To climb, first dig your axes into the ice (see the table below).  Then set 
your first foot.   With your foot secure,  pull yourself up.   Now set your 
second foot and pull yourself up.   Then repeat the process,  starting with 
digging in your axes.

Action             Joystick Moves            Keyboard Controls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dig in axes.       Push handle up.           Press up arrow.
Set first foot.    Pull handle down.         Press down arrow.
Pull yourself up.  Press fire button.        Press Spacebar.
Set second foot.   Pull handle down.         Press down arrow.

Keep  an eye on the little man to the right of the cliff.   He'll tell  you 
how  far  you've  come and how far you have  to  go.   You'll  make  steady 
progress as long as you're wearing crampons.   Without them you'll find  it 
takes several tries to set each foot.

Climb  this way until you're back on level ground.   For best results  move 
quickly enough to climb steadily,  but not so quickly that you interrupt ax 
or foot work.

Note:   See  the  section  "Using the Rope" for  more  information  on  ice 
climbing.

CLIMBING ON ROCK

As soon as you've conquered the ice, a new challenge confronts you: a steep 
rock  face.   If  possible,  stop just before you get  there.   If  you  go 
straight from ice to rock,  with no flat ground to stop in, secure yourself 
with the strap when you first get on the rock.

Take off your crampons if you're still wearing them.  (You can't climb rock 
with crampons on.)  Open your pack,  put on your soft shoes and helmet, and 
take out your chalk.  Finally, select a rope and start climbing.  The strap 
automatically removes itself when you set off.

Climbing on rock is the ultimate test of skill and coordination.   You have 
to find secure handholds for your hands and feet, pull yourself up smoothly 
and quickly, and sometimes even dodge falling boulders.

It's best to have three strong holds at all times, so that you can move the 
fourth limb safely.   The hand and foot icons to the right of the rock face 
are  your guides.   If an icon is steady, you have a secure hold with  that 
hand or foot.  A slashing icon shows a weak or tenuous hold that you should 
move as soon as possible.  If you don't see an icon, you don't have a hold.

You  can move one hand or foot at a time (see the table below).   The  limb 
that's  selected will flash on your climber.   To choose a different  limb, 
press  the  fire  button  or Spacebar enough times  to  move  the  selector 
clockwise to the limb you want.

                                              boulder's direction.

Your  first  concern should be placing a hand or foot that doesn't  have  a 
hold.  Then secure any hold that's weak (flashing icon).  If all your holds 
are secure, move the limb that will best help you advance.

When you're positioned well enough so that your arms can pull and your legs 
can push,  hoist yourself up.   Move sideways to dodge boulders and get  to 
some holds.  Sometimes you'll have to move downward to reach a secure hold.

You  may be able to change position and even hoist yourself up with one  or 
more weak holds,  but you have to move quickly.  Look carefully at the rock 
as you climb.  Try to place your hands and feet in the cracks.  They're the 
most secure places.

It  takes practice to climb well.   If you can maintain  a  smooth,  steady 
pace,  moving quickly from one good hold to another,  you'll make it to the 
top.

USING THE ROPE

The rope can save your life on either ice or rock.  But you can only use it 
if  you've packed a supply of carabiners,  ice pins,  and either pitons  or 
chocks, plus a hammer to fasten the pitons and ice pins.

Selecting the rope automatically selects the needed accessories.   It  also 
displays  a message box which  reads  "Security:  Recover/Abandon".   After 
you've climbed either 20 or 40 meters,  depending on the rope you're using, 
Security begins to flash.   You've come to the end of a pitch and you  must 
recover your rope and equipment.

If  you've packed your jummar,  you can use it to recover the rope and  all 
the  climbing aids you used.   Press Return to bring the pointer  onto  the 
screen, move it to Recover, and press the fire button or Spacebar.

If  you've  forgotten the jummar,  Recover won't  work.   You  must  select 
Abandon.   You get the rope back,  but you leave your climbing aids behind.  
If you've exhausted your supply of climbing aids,  you won't be able to use 
the rope again.

To continue climbing with the rope,  select it again from the rack and keep 
going.   If you come to a difficult pitch and you can't make progress,  try 
using your stirrups.  These are slings that fit into the carabiners to make 
artificial steps.  To use the stirrups, first select a foot and place it in 
the desired position, the press Return to move the pointer onto the screen.  
Point  to the climber's head and press the fire button or Space  to  access 
the rack.  Select the stirrups and press the fire button or Spacebar again.  
You foot will now be in a stirrup.   When you move that foot,  the stirrups 
are returned to your rack.

WHEN YOU'RE COLD, HUNGRY, OR TIRED

Climbing  is strenuous and the weather in the mountains  changes  fast,  so 
you're going to get cold,  hot, hungry, thirsty, and tired.  When you do, a 
little  climber  appears in the lower right of the screen to  tell  you  in 
words or gestures what he needs.

You  can  ignore your alter ego's demands and keep going,  but  you'll  get 
steadily  weaker  and less able to concentrate.   Pretty soon  you'll  find 
yourself hurtling down a rock face or falling into a crevasse.  Before that 
happens, it's best to stop and take care of your needs as soon as you can.

You can follow basically the same procedures to eat,  drink,  and warm  up.  
Press Return to bring the pointer onto the screen.  Move the pointer to the 
rucksack and press the fire button or Spacebar.   Find something that fills 
the bill, and press the fire button or Spacebar again.

If you've satisfied his/your needs,  the little climber and/or his  message 
disappear.   Sometimes,  though,  whatever you've chosen isn't enough.  For 
example, the little climber is shivering.  You get him a wool hat, but he's 
still cold.  Go back into the pack and take out the anorak.  That should do 
the trick.

Follow  the reverse procedure if the little climber gets  too  hot.   Press 
Return,  move the pointer over the climber's body, select the extra clothes 
in the list and return them to the pack.

When  the climber get tired,  he needs a nap.   If you're on level  ground, 
take  out  the tent.   This automatically puts him  to  sleep.   If  you've 
forgotten  the  tent,  take  out the shovel to dig  an  igloo.   If  you've 
forgotten both the tent and the shovel,  you're in trouble.   You can  keep 
going,  but  you'll get more and more tired.   If you get the cold  message 
while in the tent,  take out the sleeping bag.   If that doesn't work,  try 
the foil cover or some warmer clothes.

The clock speeds up while the climber sleeps.  The tired graphic or message 
will disappear when the climber's ready to get up.

When it's time to wake up.  reverse the procedure to put the tent or shovel 
and the sleeping bag back in the pack.   You'll probably want something  to 
eat, and then it's time to get back on the trail.

If you get hungry, thirsty, or tired while climbing, check your progress by 
looking at the little man on the right.   If you're close to the top,  keep 
going and then open your pack on level ground.

If you don't want to wait,  secure yourself with the strap, open your pack, 
and take out what you need.   If you're on a rock face,  you can even sleep 
during your climb,  using the hammock instead of the tent.   Of course,  if 
you've forgotten the hammock, you'll have to keep climbing.

IF DISASTER STRIKES

Moutaineering is dangerous,  and no matter how skilled you become, you  may 
still  make  a fatal miscalculation while climbing or overlook  a  crevasse 
while trudging across the glacier.  If you've used up your beginner's luck, 
that's the end of the game.   Fortunately, it's easy to bring yourself back 
to  life and start over.   Just press ESC and you'll find yourself  at  the 
trailend, ready to start for the summit again.  Better luck this time!

                               ENDING A GAME

STOPPING AND SAVING

To stop the clock while you take a break, press the "P" key.

To save a game in order to resume it later,  be sure to pack the Save  Game 
Disk when you're selecting items for your rucksack.   When you're ready  to 
stop  and save,  open your pack and take out the disk.   Your game will  be 
saved at that point.

When you're ready to resume play,  load the program.   When you're asked to 
choose a route,  select Resume.  You'll start climbing again from where you 
saved the game.

TRIUMPH - AND A NEW GAME

After  a  day or even longer of hard work and danger,  you reach  the  last 
summit of your trek.  You may be tired, but this is your moment of triumph.  
Enter your name in the scoring screen that appears and then press Return.

When  you're  ready  to start again,  press the fire  button  or  Spacebar.  
You'll find yourself back at the trailhead, ready to choose a new route and 
strive for new heights.

To quit the program at any time, press "Q".

                              CLIMBING TERMS

AID CLIMBING.   Climbing by actually pulling yourself up on the rope, or by 
using attachments such as a jummar and stirrups,  instead of using the rope 
for protection only.  Compare to FREE CLIMBING.

BELAY.   Any means of breaking the fall of a climber on a rope.   Also,  to 
take in or let out the rope in order to protect a climber.

BOMBER.  An extremely secure hold.  Also called "bombproof".

BOULDERING.   Climbing  on boulders,  usually to practice  difficult  moves 
before rock climbing.

BUCKET  HOLD.   A  secure hold around which  the climber can curl  all  the 
fingers of one hand.

BUILDERING.   To climb on buildings or other man-made structures.   Notable 
assaults  have  included  the  World  Trade Center  in  New  York  and  the 
Transamerica  Pyramid  in  San  Francisco.    The  prospective   skyscraper 
builderer should be prepared for a fine and a short stay in the city  jail, 
in addition to the chance to be on TV.

CAIRN.  A small pyramid of rocks used as a trail marker.

CARABINER.   A  metal  link with a gate for opening to insert  a  rope  and 
locking to secure it.   Used to connect the rope to climbing gear.  Usually 
called "beener" by climbers.

CHALK.   Special  chalk  used to keep the hands from slipping  during  rock 
climbing.   Often  called "gymnastic chalk" because it was first  developed 
for gymnasts.  It is available in colors that blend with the rock.

CHOCK.   An artificial anchor to wedge into natural gaps in the  rock.   It 
consists  of  a  piece  of metal with a rope or  metal  sling  to  which  a 
carabiner is attached.  Chocks come in a wide range of sizes.

CLASS.  The difficulty of a climb.  Climbs are rated from class 1, which is 
essentially flat ground climbs,  to class 6,  which are climbings requiring 
artificial aid.   Most expert rock climbers are interested in high class  5 
climbs,  which are extremely difficult but can be accomplished without aid.  
Classes are called "grades" in Europe.

CORNICE.   A  permanent lip-shaped snowdrift formed on the  lee  (windless) 
side of a ridge or summit.

CREVASSE.   A fissure (crack) in a glacier.  Crevasses can be very deep and 
dangerous and are often hidden by surface snow or thin ice.

CRUX.  The hardest part of a climb.

DECIMAL SYSTEM.  A subdivision system for rating the difficulty of a climb.  
Class 5 climbs, all of which require rope but must be done without aid, are 
rated from 5.1,  which is fairly easy, to 5.13, which is almost impossible.  
All climbs are rated according to their most difficult, or crux, move.

EPIC.  A dangerous climb that's more fun to talk about than endure.

EXPOSURE.   Any  situation where a fall could be lethal.   How  frightening 
this  is tends to increase with the distance to the ground,  regardless  of 
the actual increase in danger.

FREE CLIMBING.   To climb on the natural holds on the rock or ice.   A rope 
can and should be used, but for protection only.

FRIEND.   A  special  chock that automatically adjusts to a wide  range  of 
crack sizes and shapes.

FROSTBITE.   Freezing  of  flesh,  usually resulting  in  its  destruction.  
Frostbite  is  most common in the fingers,  toes,  and  face,  and  can  be 
prevented by protective clothing.

GLACIER.   A large expanse of ice, often many thousands of years old, which 
moves slowly downhill.

GLISSADE.  A controlled slide down a snowy slope.

GRADE.   In the United States,  a rating system based on the length of time 
it takes an experienced climber to do a route.   Grade I routes take  about 
an hour; grade VI routes take two days or more.

GRIPPED.  Taken by sudden fear, usually caused by EXPOSURE.

HYPOTHERMIA.   Cooling of the body core.  Hypothermia can be fatal if it is 
not treated quickly.

ICE PIN.   A pin which is hammered into ice for protection.   It has an eye 
to which a carabiner can be attached.

JUMMAR.   A mechanical device used in aid climbing.   It will slide up  but 
not down.  Also called "ascender".

MINIMUM  IMPACT.   Ecologically  sound camping,  in which no signs  of  the 
camper's presence are left behind.

PITCH.  The distance between belay points, usually one rope length.

PITON.  A pin which is hammered into rock for protection.  It has an eye to 
which a carabiner can be attached.

PROTECTION.  Anything to which the rope is attached.  usually called "pro".

RAPPEL.  To descend from a cliff by sliding down the rope.

RACK.   All  the  protection the climber carries,  usually slung  over  the 
shoulder outside the pack.

SOFT  SHOES.   Specialized shoes for climbing rock.   They are very  tight, 
with treadless soles of sticky rubber, similar to the rubber used for drag-
racing tires.

SNOW PACK.  The accumulation of snow on the ground.

WHITE  OUT.   A  combination of heavy snowfall and high wind  that  reduces 
visibility to near zero.
