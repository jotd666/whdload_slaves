 This install applies to "Future Wars/Les Voyageurs Du Temps" © 1990 Delphine

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

Notes, comments & thanks:

- For pre-v3.0 versions, due to my fawlty crack on the "puzzle" protected version,
  some parts of the game were unplayable (first one to occur is in the "Middle Age"
  section I think), at least for the french version but random bugs could occur
  anywhere. I think the U.S. (with paintspot protection) was not affected.
  Thanks to P. Bareges for reporting them and testing. I think v3.0 is the final
  release (but who knows :))

- A working crack existed (from a german version) which could be easily adapted to all
  other versions (including the US version with the spotted trousers). I finally gave up
  all my complex crack attempts (which did not work very well: Monk part bug) in favor
  of the simple crack I adapted => everything works fine now

- To upgrade from 2.x or 1.x to 4.0, just reinstall, or copy the file
  called "startup-sequence" in data/s (create s directory if needed)

- If you've got a saves disk, you can copy its contents in the game directory.

- Thanks to Chris Vella / Olivier Schott / Christian Sauer / Juergen Borgmeyer
  for original disk images

- Thanks to dosgraveyard.com for their pdf document on Future Wars

- The install should also work with cracks, although it's not guaranteed.
