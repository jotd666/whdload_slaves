The aim of the game.

Similarly to Frankenstein of older times, Professor Bloodheart believes

Professor Bloodheart yuo have escaped from his clutches.

Your mission, if you decide to accept it, is to fight your way through
hordes of his mutants ever onwards towards your final confrontation with
the mad Professor himself. The tower is filled with tricks, traps, stairs,
passageways and secret rooms. Scattered around are various weapons and
potions to aid you in your quests well as heaps of treasure which will
increase your score.

Enjoying link play

"Fears" may be played by two people on different Amigas providing the
machines are joined by an appropriate cable. Select the option from the
main menu and load the game on the first machine. Once the game has been
loaded on the first machine then it may then be loaded on the second. If
different speed machines are joined then Fears will run at the speed of the
slower of the two machines.

Using the editor 

Included with the game is a level editor which with practice will allow you
to create your own levels to play in Fears. this is a simplified versiom of
the actual editor used to create "FEARS" which we hope will provide you
with hours of enjoyment. You will not be able to construct some of the more
difficult effects used in the game. (eg doors activated by distant switches
are not allowed ) as this requires some specialist knowledge. However you
will be able to create quite complex mazes which should be great fun
particularly in "link play". We should be pleased to receive your efforts
and if we have enough we will make them available via an add on disk.

WE STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU CAREFULLY READ THIS SECTION OF THE MANUAL IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEMO LEVEL SUPPLIED BEFORE EMBARKING ON YOUR OWN
MASTERPIECE. PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE USE OF BOTH SHAPE EDITORS.

The editor at first sight will appear daunting to use but with patience and
practice you should soon be producing complex mazes. To begin with we
recommend that you learn to create simple rooms joining them by doors and
staircases before advancing to more complex shapes.

The editoe is loaded by selecting EDIT MAZE from the main menu and is
controlled by the use of seven screens accessed by the keys F1  to F7 or by
use of a push button pad in the top right hand corner of each edit screen.
Detailed below is a description and use of each of these seven screens.

There is a demo level in the editor when it is loaded. Remember that these
screens will need to be removed from the editor before you can start work
on your own masterpiece. Select "NEW"

F1  SHAPE EDITOR

On this screen you design the shape and heights of your maze. There are
also icon words for:

Load / save          save up to 3 levels on a standard formatted disk.
Please ensure that you have a formatted disk to save on before designing a
level.

New                  clears everything in the current level.

Clear                Clears current screen

Player               Allows placement of starting position of each player.

Direction arrows     Used to select the direction a player is facing at the
start of a level.

Placing players on the map

This is acheived by 3 left button presses on the mouse. Click left mouse
button on the word / icon "PLAYER" once. Click right mouse button a second
time on the word / icon "PLAYER" and then move the mouse pointer to the
position on the layout grid in which you wish to place the player. Select
right mouse button and the player will be placed in the appropriate
position facing in the direction indicated by the direction arrows. If you
wish to change the direction a player is facing then us the direction
arrows.

Designing a maze shape

The maze is viewed from above in the large layout grid window. On the right
hand side of the screen are a range of colours from turquoise (lowest) to
pink (highest). Each colour represents a different height within the
maze. Thus a floor coloured in a shade of blue is lower then one in a shade
of red. Within each colour band there are eight diffeeent shades. Each
shade represents a level a step higher or lower than one immediately above
or below it.

This sounds complicated but if you wish to build a flight of stairs for
example that ran from an area at height dark blue then you would place on
the map a series of squares using that colour range. Just try it and you`ll
soon pick it up.

Using the left mouse button, select a colour from the right hand bar and
create your floor areas. Each area needs to be surrounded by a wall and
naturally to create this effect you should choose a colour for the wall
that is higher than the level you are surrounding. As a rough guide a wall
should be eight colour bars higher than the floor that it surrounds. This
same technique is used to create a complete overhead view of the your maze.
You may make the maze as small or as large as you like. You are only
limited by the size of the grid. 
   
F2 ADVANCED SHAPE EDITOR

This is similar to the editor om F1 but now you can also see your design in
profile. The main screen is divided into two main areas. The top view is an
overhead view as in F1. you may scroll the map of your maze up and down
using the arrow keys. As each section moves under the highlight bar that
runs across the upper part of the screen a side on view of that section of
the maze is displayed in the lower window. In this lower window you will
notice that there is are height bars depicting the floor height of each
level of your maze. It will normally appear as two walls with a gap in
between. You need to add a ceiling.

Adding a ceiling

This is achieved by selecting one of the small bars immediately at the top
of the lower section with the right mouse button and bringing it down to
meet the top of the surrounding walls. This will set a height which you
must continue across the whole of the room if you wish to create a room
with a ceiling of uniform height. Continue to scroll the map in the upper
section under the highlight bar setting each ceiling height as you go. With
practice you will be able to create variable height ceilings and walls even
within the same room setting.

F3 ITEMS EDITOR

On this screen you can place items and monsters in the game. You are
presented with an overhead view of your maze ( remember to "CLEAR" any of
the demo maze.) On the rigth hand side there is a list of items/monsters
that can be placed on the level. Select an item/monster with the left mouse
button and place it where you want in the maze, pressing the left mouse
button. To erase something press the right mouse button.

You are allowed to have a maximum of 999 items and 63 aliens on a level. By
pressing the "tab" key you can view where all the items of the same kind
are situated.

F4 TEXTURES EDITOR

This screeen is used in conjunction with the textures selection screen (F5)
to place a texture on walls, ceilings and floors.

There are a range of buttons immediately above a right hand panel which
control the main area of the screen display:

TEXT. WALL UP         This refers to walls that come down from the ceiling.

TEXT. WALL DOWN       This refers to walls that come up from the floor.

TEXT. CEILING         Refers to the ceiling.

TEXT. FLOOR           Refers to the floor.

In the right hand panel is a list of numbers and colours that refer to the
various textures available. Some are specified particularly for ceilings
and floors whilst others are doors and end of level. You can if you wish
use wall textures for floors and floor textures for walls. The layout is
just our opinion.
Select, using the buttons the area on which you wish to add a texture. Then
select the texture you wish to add with the left mouse button from the
current list in the right hand panel. Select an area on the main grid which
depicts your maze and add the texture to this area with the left mouse
button.
When selecting a texture for a floor or ceiling the whole of the floor or
the whole of the ceiling will default to the selected texture unless areas
are done individually.

F5 TEXTURES SELECTION

This screen is used in conjunction with the TEXTURES EDITOR (F4). The
textures available are divided into three separate sections. You can
highlight each section by using the small counter arrows on the right hand
side of the screen. Each bank of texture corresponds to the panel on the
right hand side of the screen F4 i.e the top left hand texture is for the
floor, whilst the bottom right hand texture can be applied to an exit. Once
you have selected your textures return to the TEXTURES EDITOR (F4) to use
them in your maze.

F6 THE MONSTERS LIST

This screen is used to select the monsters that can appear in your maze.
You are allowed to have three monster types in each maze. Select a
compartment in the lower part of the screen by selecting the appropriate
button with the mouse and then select which monster you wish to place in
this compartment. These compartments correspond to monsters 1,2 and 3 on
the ITEMS EDITOR (F3)

F7 THE DOORS EDITOR

Of course you will wish to have doors in your maze. You may have up to 63
doors in a level. The 64th door is always used as the exit of the level.
Using the counter in the right hand panel select a door number. To place a
door on the layout screen select a position with the mouse and press the
left mouse button. You will notice that the right hand panel gives a
profile view of the door in a closed and open position. Adjust the heights
of the open position (ensuring that the surrounding walls are the same
height as the doorway.). There are eight different settings possible for
each door which correspond to the positions of the switch which operates
it. These can be altered with the left mouse button. Work your way through
the level placing and setting all the doors that you require. Remember that
the END OF LEVEL EXIT MUST ALWAYS BE NUMBERED AS DOOR 64.

If you wish to delete a door this can be done by clicking on the
icon/letter "D" in the right hand panel.

Rememeber creating a level involves quite a lot of careful and thoughtful
planning and attention to detail. At each stage of design you can test out
the level by saving and then reloading it into the game environment. If
walls are too high or ceilings too low you can then return to the editor
and make the adjustments necessary. We look forward to seeing your efforts
