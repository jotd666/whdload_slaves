 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

     Cheat (from Abaddon Sweetcheater):
            
        Save your position in the dungeons or caves.  The go through it and
        open doors until you run out of keys.  Now restore your position,
        and you will have all your keys, but all the doors will still be
        open.  Repeat as often as you need.

        Go to the dark evil castle.  Stand right up against the force
        field.  Let yourself starve so that you faint.  When you wake up,
        you'll be on the other side of the forcefield.

        Find the green turtle, jump on his back and start attacking.
        Nothing will happen except your bravery points will keep piling up.

        On the island with the Crystal Castle press RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON
        while speaking with the sorceress and luck increases to 65.  Ask
        the sorceress several times.
        
        A secret entrance to the fort exists.  On the left side, near even
        with the door.
        
        If running low on Green keys, use a secret entrance for the fort.
        It's on the left side, almost even with the door.

        Beating the Turtle is not beating, it is pushing, so push the
        turtle across the land, to use it in special places: The turtle was
        programmed in asbestos, and can swim in Lava. It can be used to
        enter the black citadel at the south.  Also, while it is present,
        you are not attacked, but by the time one has the turtle, one is
        already invincible.

        Save a game to a back up file and patch byte 18 to a non-zero value
        and you know have these cheats at your disposal:

                ARROW KEYS____Move very fast over any terrain.
                'B'__________________________Summon gold swan.
                'R'___________________________Rescue princess.
                '='_______________________Display coordinates.
                'F9'________________Increase time by one hour.
                'F10'_________________Location in coordinates.
