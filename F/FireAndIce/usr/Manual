The Story So Far
-----------------

Suten quietly congratulated himself . This was the perfect place to hide.
Already worshipped by the indigenous Human population,he could
remain here undisturbed.He needed to rest from some time ,it had been a
long journey,over 12 light year across the coldness of space.Here he
could absorb energy from the heat of the midday sun,and it was verry hot
here.He began to make plans for his takeover of this small planet ,all he
needed now was time to replenish his energy.He laughed out loud as he 
recalled the moent of his escape from his prison of two thousand years
It had actually been verry easy ,he thought.The guards had become slow
and lethargic,they had made mistakes.He knew they would ,after all,he
had time to wait ,nothing but time.
Glemm had picked up the trail at last.It had take a while,but he knew
that somewhere there would be evidence of the vast expense of magical
energy required to transport his old enemy away from this place .How
could they have let him escape ,he wondered `He called upon the 
elemental forces to begin the chase .He would have to be careful ,Suten
was dangerous.He would have no qualms about starting a full-scale
elemental battle wherever he was,and at any cost to his surroundings
Glemm remembered how ab entire solar system had been destroyd prior
to Suten`s capture.That was why he had been incarcerated for the 
remainder of his existence.
The trail led to a small blue-green planet ,the third of nine orbiting a
yellow star.Suten was bound to be somewhere in the hotter regions.Fire
had always been his favourite elemental force.It was more desturctive 
than the others.This was not goin to be easy .Direct confrontation would
be disastrous for all the life-forms on the planet .No ,there had to another
way.Glemm needed an agent ,someone he could help to defeat Suten
without arounsinf too much suspicion.Who would be the best choice
certainly not a Human ,they were far to stupid and clumsy .They couldnt
here their way out of a paper bag.The sort if hero required needed to be
smart ,cunning ,fast ,and willing to travel!
Glemm began his search near the northern polar ice cap.There werent 
many suitable canidates here at all.He could feel Sutens evil magic
even here ,he didnt have long.Many if the less inteligent creatures were
already behaving agressively towards each other,on a path of certain
sel-destruction.Where was the hero he needed?Walruses? Too slow!
Peskimons ? Too stupid! He focussed on a small igloo ,and heard the distant
sound of music.He had chanced upon tge gine if ibe Ciik Coyote.He could`t
risk direct contact .His materialisation would almost certainly be 
detected by the rejuvenated Suten.He would have to help the hero in
more subtle ways....

Weaponry
---------

Cool Coyote`s main weapon is ice pellets,small round lumps of ice 
wich can freeze enemies.More than one hit may be required to do this.
Jab fire to launch an ice pellet.Secondary special weapons may also be
obtained.Metal discs may be found lying arround ,which bear symbols
relating to their function.Touch the disc to pick it up,It turns blue and
moves to the top right of the screen to confirm that it has been collected
The special weapon display also shows smaller versions of the symbol.Up
to three of these are displayed ,showing the last three shots of the weapon
Some many only start with one or two shots.Picking up another disc of the
same type as already held will accumulate shots,whereas picking up 
a different type will replace the old weapon.
Multiple special weapons discs are contained in bonus ice blocks,and 
crystal orbs.
More special weapons are revealed as the game progresses.You will find
such weapons as airbombs ,rain clouds,shields and the sonic bark.

Clouds and Snow Bombs.

Cool Coyote can carry up to secen snow bombs at a time,launched by 
duckin down and holding fire pressed for a short time.These bombs rise
into the air and hit all enemies on screen.Snow bombs can be optained
from three places:
1) clouds.This is the main source,not to be confused with thunderheads,
wich are an altogether unpleasent experience.Fire at the fluffy white 
clouds to cool them down.They will start to rain,then hail,the snow if
you continue fire at them.Once snowing the deposite large flakes,
wich may be collected for later use . After a short time the clouds can
snow no more and become storm clouds.Move away at this point to avoid 
being struck by lightning.
2) bonus ice block.Instead of special weapons discs,occasionaly a snow
bomb may be released
3)crystal orbs,behaving much as bonus ice blocks.

Freezing Enemies
-----------------
One more of the hits from ice pellets or snow bombs is required to freeze
each enemy.They will stay frozen for a few seconds before flashing.This 
indicates that htey are thawing out.They will then resume their normal
ativities,but beware ,they will be more immune to a second freezing,In order
to elminate a meanie you must shatter is while it is frozen by
walkin or jumping into it.
The puppies can also shatter enemies.Note
also that freezing a flying enemy will cause it to crash on the ground and 
shatter.
At the moment that you shatter a meanie it will receal a key part if it was
carrying it,accompanied by a sound effect.The key will remain where it
was produced until Cool Coyote approaches it,whereupon it will chases him
until picked up.

Displayed Information
----------------------

*SCORE     LLLL ####
   0       ******

* is a snowflake showing the number of days remaining to complete the
land each `arm` of the flake represents one day and night.When the flake
is gone on the seventh night ,the fire wizzard will have had time to locate
our hero and hot things up for him.

LLLLL is the lives remaining display.Up to nine may be held ub reserce

##### is the special weapon display ,showing the last three shots and the type.

*** is the snow bomb stock,up to seven may be carried.

Getting from Place to Place
----------------------------

Each of the countries visited by Cool Coyote is split into as many as five
lands.Some lands are secret locations and others may be skipped if you
find secret exits.It is not neccesary to visit all lands to complete the game.
You are given a percantage of lands covered with your high score 
entry.It is possible to visit all the lanfs in one game ,there are either/or
situations.
Exit from most lands will be via the ice door,wich Cool Coyote must locate
on each land.This will be shaped a key-hole. The key to open this has been
split into six pieces and each piece has been given to one of Suten`s minion
types, e.g. one of the penguins will have one part (alwaysthe same part,
not always the same penguin!). As our hero collects eachpart, all currently
collected parts are shown at the bottom of the screen. Touching the exit door
with an incomplete key also does it. Touching the exit door having collected
all the parts will open the door. Jump through the door to get to the next
land.
Some lands have secret and not-so-secret exits, jumping into these will also
get to another land. The full key is not required to do this.

Ice Steps and Bridges
----------------------

Situated around the landscape are magical ice switches. Step into them to
activate a column of ice steps or an ice bridge. These temporarily provide
access to other places. They slowly melt and finally are unable to support any
weight. The hotter the land,the quicker they melt. Puppies will use the steps
and bridges,but lead them away before the ice melts.

Puppies
--------

On many lands, Coyote puppies can be found. If on screen or just beyond they
will attempt to jump towards Cool Coyote for protection. they are to small to
concern other creatures and will not be hurt by them. Like Cool Coyote,they
are able to fire small ice pellets,and do so when he does. They can be led to
the exit doorway and through it to yield an extra life. One way to do this is
to stand opposite exit.
Puppies are afraid to use moving platforms and cannot jump large gaps or into
deep holes. They will also wander off it left behind. They can be made to jump
ahead of Cool Coyote by firing rapidly for a short time. This makes the puppies
feel brave and they will move off in the direction the Coyote is facing.
Stop firing for a short while and they will return. The puppies can also
shatter frozen enemies,and,since they can fire ice pellets, are capable of
eliminating meanies on their own,ceven if Cool Coyote has been hit.

Days and Nights
----------------

The sky colour changes from day to night every so often,and the snowflake at
the top left of the display information loses one `arm` at every nightfall
(Except the first). After seven days and nights,the fire wizard will track
down Cool Coyote and hot things up for him. Keep going at this point,and hurry
to the exit,it only gets hotter from here on.

Bonus Objects
--------------

Many small bonus objects are dotted about each land. These may be collected
for bonus points and are also accumulated towards extra bonuses.

Extra Lives
------------
Extra lives,indicated by the 1UP symbol are awarded at 20.000, 70.000,
150.000, 260.000 and 400.000 points. They are also obtained by piching up
the bonus-us ice bones and by guiding puppies through the exit doors.
