                               HOW TO PLAY

[1mHOW TO PLAY THE ADVENTURES OF DIZZY[0m
Daisy has been captured by the Evil Wizard Zaks.
Only Dizzy is brave and clever enough to rescue her from a terrible fate.
Leaving the safety of the Yolkfolk's treehouse village, Dizzy sets out on
his greatest adventure!

As you walk Dizzy around, he will be prevented from adventuring further
by various puzzles.
You can solve these puzzles by using the objects found along the way.
To pick an object up stand Dizzy over it and press the RED button. Dizzy
can only hold 3 objects at a time.
To take a better look at them press the FFWD button. To solve a puzzle,
find the correct object and put it in the correct place, eg. put the
key down over the door to unlock it.

                             HINTS AND TIPS

[1mLIFE FORCE AND DAMAGE[0m
Dizzy starts the adventure with two lives. Dizzy will meet all kinds
of evil creatures. Some may kill Dizzy immediately while others will
only damage him a little bit. If Dizzy takes too much damage he will
lose one of his lives. Eating fruit found along the way will heal
some of his damage. You can also win bonus lives by solving the sliding
puzzles.

[1m250 MAGIC STARS[0m
Around the map there are 250 spinning stars. Each of these represents
one magic unit. You must eventually collect all 250 in order to enter
Zaks' magic castle and complete the game. You can use the number
of stars remaining as a guide to how far through the game you are.

[1mAN EXAMPLE PROBLEM AND HOW TO SOLVE IT[0m
Later on in the game, high in the tree house there is a platform
which is too high to jump onto. Attached to this platform is a rope
and a hook. At another part of the map close by there is a weight.
You can pick up the weight, take it to the tree house, attach it
to the hook and bring the ramp down to where you can jump on it.

[1mHOW TO PLAY THE SLIDING/SWAPPING PUZZLE[0m
If you come across one of these, there is a bonus life to be had if
you can solve it before the egg-timer runs out! You'll see a
flashing square over the top left block of the scroll. You can move
this UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, using your control pad. Press and
hold the RED Button whilst pushing in a direction to swap the square
you are on with the adjacent square. In this way you can unscramble
the picture. Watch out for some variations on this puzzle - you'll
have to work them out for yourself!

[1mHOW TO USE THE ROPE[0m
The rope is handy for getting across chasms which are too wide to
jump. Unfortunately, there has to be a hook over the chasm for
Dizzy to attach his rope to. Put Dizzy in a good position for
starting his swing, and then use the rope by pushing your RED Button
while the rope is in any space on your OBJECTS HELD window in the
bottom panel.

                            THE STORY SO FAR

[1mTHE STORY SO FAR.....[0m
The land of the Yolkfolk had always been a safe and peaceful place.
The Yolkfolk themselves, with their oval shaped bodies and bright
red gloves and boots, lived in treehouses high in the forest.
They spent their days exploring the forest and mining diamonds,
to trade with the trolls in the neighbouring town of Keldor.
This had been the tradition for as long as anyone could remember...
that was until that fateful day, when a dark stranger came to the
land.

The stranger, known as Wizard Zaks, wore a long black cloack and
a pointed hat which shaded his glowing eyes. He took over Keldor
Castle, and summoned the head of the Yolkfolk.
Grand Dizzy went to the castle, only to be greeted by armour clad
trolls carrying axes. He introduced himself as a friend, but
Zaks ordered the guards to seize him. Grand Dizzy cunnungly
somersaulted over their heads and escaped. From that day forward,
the Yolkfolk have lived in fear of Zaks and his evil powers.

One Day, Dizzy and his girlfriend Daisy, were walking in the
forest when the sky turned black, and Zaks cast an evil spell
over the Yolkfolk. A large bird swooped down and carried Daisy
away to Zaks' newly build castle in the clouds.
It is now up to Dizzy to undo Zaks' evil spells on his friends,
and rescue Daisy from his evil clutches.

             A message from the authors of Fantastic Dizzy AGA
             -------------------------------------------------


Fantastic  Dizzy was originally written for the NES a few years back, since
then  we  (Purple  Haze) have coded the Sega Megadrive/Genesis versions and
the Amiga A500 and Amiga A1200/A4000 (AGA) versions for you to enjoy!

The  original A500 version of Fantastic Dizzy was technically great and was
presented well...  So why did we earn less that 3000 pounds from it???

Piracy!!   You  Amiga  owners have finally done it!  Software houses are no
longer producing Amiga games!!!  The future looks bleak...

UNLESS...  You start buying games!!

You can start by buying the ORIGINAL of FANTASTIC DIZZY AGA or CD32!!

If  we  don't  make  any  cash out of this version we will NEVER do another
Amiga game, Ha!
