	That install applies to "Xenon 2" © 1988,1991 The Bitmap Brothers.
	It supports 6 floppy disk and the CDTV version of Xenon 2.

	That install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the WHDLoad package.
	To install from a different drive than DF0: select Expert as
	installation mode.

	CDTV: You need 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	Floppy: You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	
	You can quit the game by pressing F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=").

	Features:
	 - some access faults removed
	 - highscores will be saved
	 - after game over a wait has been added, which waits until the fire
	   button is not pressed for a while, this is to prevent filling the
	   highscore table with 'AAA' if autofire is used
	 - the game hs been patched so that cash can be taked over from one
	   shop to the next (in original cash is cleared on shop exit)
	 - trainer added, gives 100000 cash and 9 ships, trainer will be
	   enabled via Tooltype Custom1, if trainer is enabled the highscores
	   wont be saved
	 - in the CDTV version Custom2 redirects the left mouse button to the
	   fire button B (if you don't have a joypad)
	 - CD music control from the game is currently impossible (CDTV), 
	   maybe there will be a future version of WHDLoad which makes it
	   possible

	if you have problems with this installation please try first to get
	a newer version of this install from 
		http://www.whdload.de
	if that does'nt help try some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC,
	NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. if that also does'nt help inform the
	author via the Bug-Report-Form which can be accessed on
		http://www.whdload.de

	Wepl in December 1998 and May 1999.
	Thanks to Frank Brandis for support.

	version Floppy 1.12 (14.07.2019) done by JOTD:
	- reduced chipmem usage to strict $80000 instead of $81000, so 512k chip amigas can use it.
	- fixed another prefetch issue for 2 ancient versions
	  (related to copylock protection, see notes on WinUAE on 1.8, same root cause,
	  strange as it used to work with previous versions of WinUAE without "more compatible")

	version Floppy 1.11 (25.02.18) by JOTD:
	- CUSTOM2 allows to skip introduction for floppy versions which have one.
    - quitkey available for 68000

	- adapted to WHDLoad v17

	- supports another disk version (one disk version by Speedlock
	  Associates)
	- autofire highscore writer preventer added

	version Floppy 1.8 (13.08.04) by Wepl:
	- two more disk versions supported (budget: one disk without intro
	  and one disk complete on PDos), thanks JOTD
	- SMC on two disk versions removed which caused problems on UAE
	  (Toni Wilen)
	  
	version Floppy 1.7 (11.05.03) by Wepl:

	- highscore saving fixed (sorry, old scores are lost)
	- cash takeover added
	- trainer fixed
	
	JOTD notes:
	- I originally intended to create a "superpowered" cheatmode, but I gave up because this game
	  is quite difficult to understand and there are a lot of versions so I lost patience. I just added more
	  continues in the existing trainer.
	- What would be also cool would be using the second button for "dive" feature (instead of space),
	  which is available later in the game. Once again, 7 versions to support + testing/debugging at some advanced
	  stage daunted me (for now).
	- The patch removes the "zero credits after shop", which is not faithful to the original game (some advice states: 
	  "you cannot take it with you"). Makes game slightly easier by allowing not spending all the money. Maybe a stupid design
	  from the programmers, but the original design.
	- Also we could use in-game keys: F1: resplenish energy, F2: levelskip, ...
