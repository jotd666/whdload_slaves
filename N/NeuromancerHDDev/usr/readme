 This install applies to "Neuromancer" © 1988-1989 Interplay

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

Requirements:

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 The game requires a installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

History:
 
 Version 3.0 (21.12.2020) done by JOTD:
 - proper sound fix (avoids lockups on very fast machines,
   that also explains why it failed on version 1.0 probably)
 - proper blitter fix
 - reassembled with latest kickemu => 68000 quitkey (issue #0004897)
 
 Version 2.0 (2002)
 - does not use KickDOS anymore but direct dos emulation with newest kickemu
 with interrupt system fixed: no longer locks, music plays ok.
 - Annoying bug fixed: when loading a game from title screen, the game "forgot" to
 draw the control panel: the result was a mix between title screen and game.
 - lots of self-modifying code fixed
 - Also better crack (no need to press RETURN) and rewritten installer script and
 major source cleanup (shorter slave)
 - Source code included
 - Nice icons by Frank
  
 Version 1.0 (2001?)
 - first release.
 - Sometimes the game locks on title screen. Don't let it happen,
   click on "New" or "Load" quickly. Music does not play right too.
 - Docfile/walkthrough included
