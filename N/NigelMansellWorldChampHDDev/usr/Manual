COUNTRY. AND EACH OF THE 16 TRACKS IS REPRESENTED.OBVIOUSLY,YOUR AIM IS TO
EMULATE THE SUCCESS OF NIGEL MANSELL, AND WIN THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AS
FAST AS POSSIBLE.

ON LOADING
----------
WHEN YOU FIRST LOAD WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, THE FIRST SCREEN WHICH YOU
ENCOUNTER AFTER THE TITLE SCREEN WILL BE THE MAIN SCREEN.

TO MOVE BETWEEN THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS.MOVE THE JOYSTICK UP OR DOWN, AND
EACH OF THE OPTIONS WILL BECOME HIGHLIGHTED.TO SELECT AN OPTION, PRESS THE
FIRE BUTTON WHEN THE OPTION IS HIGHLIGHTED. EACH OF THE OPTIONS IS FULLY
EXPLAINED IN THE NEXT SECTION OF THE MANUAL.

SECTION 1; RACE A CIRCUIT
-------------------------
IF YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE PART IN A SINGLE RACE, THEN A SCREEN WILL APPEAR
WHICH WILL ALLOW YOU TO SELECT WHICH OF THE 16 CIRCUITS YOU WILL RACE ON,
MOVING THE JOYSTICK UP AND DOWN WILL HIGHLIGHT EACH COUNTRY IN TURN, AND A
PICTURE OF THE TRACK WILL APPEAR TO THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN. ONCE THE TRACK
WHICH THE PLAYER WISHES TO RACE UPON IS HIGHLIGHTED,PRESSING THE FIRE
BUTTON WILL TAKE THE PLAYER TO THE RELEVANT TRACK INFORMATION SCREEN.

TRACK INFORMATION SCREEN
------------------------
THIS SCREEN OFFERS A DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCUIT WHICH YOU ARE ABOUT TO
RACE,AND BENEATH THIS IS A WEATHER FORECAST AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RAIN AS A
PERCENTAGE.UNDERNEATH THIS PANEL YOU ARE OFFERED THE CHANCE TO TUNE YOUR
CAR.QUALIFY FOR THE RACE,RACE THE CIRCUIT,OR CANCEL. EACH IS EXPLAINED ON
THE FOLLOWING PAGES.

TUNING YOUR CAR
---------------
THIS SCREEN ALLOWS YOU TO CONFIGURE YOUR VEHICLE TO SUIT A PARTICULAR RACE.

ON THIS SINGLE SCREEN THE PLAYER HAS THE OPTION TO SET-UP THE CAR TO SUIT
THE WEATHER AND TRACK CONDITIONS. THERE ARE 4 PARAMETERS THAT CAN BE
CHANGED TESE ARE LISTED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.

GEARS
-----
THE CHOICE OFFERED HERE IS BETWEEN MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC GEARS.AUTOMATIC IS
THE DEFAULT MODE. WHEN AUTO GEARS ARE SELECTED THE PLAYER IS RELIEVED OF
THE NEED TO CHANGE GEAR THUS MAKING THE GAME EASIER TO PLAY,HOWEVER,THERE
IS A SMALL PENALTY TO PAY AS THE POINT AT WHICH THE GEARS ARE CHANGED IN
AUTO IS NOT THE OPTIMUM SETTING.

GEAR RATIO
----------
HERE THE PLAYER MUST SELECT low, Medium WHICH IS THE DEFAULT. AND HIGH. LOW
GEARS WILL IMPROVE THE CARS ACCELERATION BUT REDUCE THE TOP SPEED. MEDIUM
OFFERS A BALANCE OF ACCELERATION AND SPEED. WHILST HIGH HAS SLOWER 
ACCELERATION BUT OFFERS A BETTER TOP SPEED.FROM THE TRACK INFO THE PLAYER
HAS TO ASSESS WHICH CHARTERISTIC,WETHER SPEED OR ACCELERATION IS BETTER
SUITED TO ANY PARTICULAR TRACK.

TYRES
-----
THE CHOICE HERE IS BETWEEN HARD,THE DEFAULT `SOFT` AND WET TYRES. THERE ARE
2 PARAMETERS RELEATING TO TYRES,RATE OF WEAR AND GRIP. FAST CORNERING AND
RUNNING OFF THE TRACK INCREASES THE RATE OF TYRE WEAR. HARDER TYRES WEAR
SLOWER. THE TYRES CAN WEAR OUT ENTIRELY,OF COURSE FORCING A PLAYER TO
RETIRE FROM THE RACE. IN THIS SITUATION 5HE PLAYERS CAR WILL BE POSITIONED
LAST IN THE RESULTS TABLE. SOFT TYRES IMPROVE THE CARS GRIP ABD SO IMPROVE
CORNERING BUT REQUIRE CHANGING SOONER. IN A NORMAL RACE THE PLAYER WILL
ONLY NEED TO CHANGE HARD TYRES ONCE,HOWEVER, SOFT TYRES MAY NEED TO BE
CHANGED TWICE. THE PLAYER HAS THE OPTION TO CHANGE THE TYRES ANY NUMBER OF
TIMES IN THE PITS, BUT ENTERING THE PITS OBVIOUSLY RESULTS IN PENALTY TIME.
IF THE TRACK HAS RAIN ON IT ,THEN WETS WILL HAVE TO BE USED. WHEN THE TRACK
IS WET THESE TYRES WILL WEAR AT THE SAME RATE AS HARD TYRES BUT IN THE DRY,
WET TYRES WEAR FASTER THAN SOFT TYRES. IF THE TRACK IS WET BOTH HARD AND
SOFT TYRES HANDLE POORLY AND THE CAR WILL BE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE. THE
CONDITION OF THE TYRE IS DISPLAYED AS PART OF THE CONTROL PANEL

AEROFOIL
--------
FOR AEROFOILS THE CHOICE IS BETWEEN ACUTE,THE DEFAULT IS MID, AND
SHALLOW.SETTING THE AEROFOIL TO ACUTE WILL IMPROVE THE CARS CORNERING IN A
SIMILAR MANNER TO SOFT TYRES,HOWEVER, IN THIS POSITION THE AEROFOIL WILL
INCREASE THE CAR DRAG AND THUS REDUCE ITS SPEED. SETTING THE AEROFOIL TO
SHALLOW WILL RESULT IN THE CAR HAVING A BEST TOP SPEED BUT POOR CORNERING.

QUALIFY FOR THE RACE
--------------------
IF THE PLAYER SELECTS QUALIFY FROM THE TRACK INFO SCREEN THE PLAYER HAS THE
OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE FOR GRID POSITION. THE PLAYER HAS TO SO ONE LAP AND
THE TIME WILL DTERMINE HOW MANY CARS ARE IN FRONT OF THE PLAYERS CAR AT THE
START OF THE RACE. THE ACTUAL POSITION OF THE PLAYERS CAR WILL BE
DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE QUALIFYING LAP TIME ACHIEVED BY THE PLAYER WITH
A REFERENCE TIME FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL TRACK. AS IN REAL FORMULA ONE RACING,
THE PLAYER WILL HAVE TO AVOID THE OTHER CARS ON THE TRACK,ALTHOUGH THE
PLAYER IS NOT DIRECTLY COMPETING GAINST THEM. ON COMPLETION OF THE
QUALIFYING LAP THE PLAYER WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO ONTO THE RRACE.

RACE THE CIRCUIT
----------------
IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO QUALIFY FOR THE RACE, THEN YOU AUTOMATICALLY BEGIN THE
RACE FROM THE BACK OF THE GRID,THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THE FASTEST WAY TO GET
INTO A RACE.BUT IT WILL BE A LOT EASIER TO FINISH AMONGST THE LEADERS IF
YOU BEGIN AT THE FRONT OF THE GRID,THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

CANCEL
------
THIS WILL TAKE YOU TO THE TRACK SELECTION SCREEN SHOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR
MIND.

RACING
------
THE PLAYER MAY ENTER A RACE DIRECTLY FROM THE TRACK INFO SCREEN OR VIA A
QUALIFYING ROUND.THE PLAYER COMPETES AGAINST 11 OTHER CARS OF VARYING
ABILITY,THE COMPETITORS CARS ARE GROUPED INTO 3 CLASSES,FOUR GOOD,FOUR
AVERAGE,THREE POOR.
EACH RACE WILL TAKE PLACE OVER 5 LAPS WITH THE FASTEST CAR TAKING BETWEEN
50 SECONDS AND 2 MINUTES TO COMPLETE EACH LAP. THIS IS DEPENDANT UPON WHICH
TRACK THE RACE IS ON. THE RACE SEQUENCE WILL END WHEN THE PLAYER HAS
FINISHED 5 LAPS,UNLESS ALL COMPETITORS HAVE FINISHED,IN WHICH CASE THE
PLAYER IS OBVIOUSLY LAST.

PITSTOPS
--------
THE PITS ARE LOCATED NEAR THE START OF THE TRACK IN A FIXED POSITION FOR
EACH CIRCUIT AND THE PLAYER MAY ENTER THE PITS AT ANY LAP. THE ONLY REASON
TO ENTER THE PITS IS TO FIT NEW TYRES. WHEN THE PLAYERS CAR ENTERS THE PITS
THE SCREEN WILL CHANGE, AND THE PLAYER WILL BE PROMPTED TO SELECT THE TYPE
OF TYRES TO FIT. ONCE THIS IS DONE, AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE OF THE CAR BEING
LIFTED AND THE TYRES BEING CHANGED WILL RUN, THE PIT STOP TAKES BETWEEN 5
AND 9 SECONDS, THIS TIME BEING RANDOM, AND NOT UNDER CONTROL OF THE PLAYER.
