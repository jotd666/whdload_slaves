 This install applies to "Nick Faldo's Championship Golf" © 1992-1994 Grandslam

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 Floppy:

 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 CD³² version:

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick345.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 Cheat (from Sweetcheater):

  On the title screen, type "MAJORTOM".  You should now find an option
  to play a round on mars.

  To get a hole in one everytime, choose to play as an amateur, then
  start the game.  When you putt, the {A MULLIGAN} option will appear.
  Click on {OLD} and your shots should decrease by one.  Repeat until
  you are on stroke one, and put the ball in.
