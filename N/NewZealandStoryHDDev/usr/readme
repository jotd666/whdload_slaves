 version 2.4 (xx.11.2020) done by JOTD:
 - merged version 2.2 bugfixes that I overlooked (but most fixes from broken 2.1 were
   already been fixed). Means just optimize the slave code, nothing more
   
 version 2.3 (12.09.2020) done by JOTD
 - restored original title picture (can be paused with BUTTONWAIT)
 - self-modifying code removed: end screen was completely trashed
 - high-scores aren't saved anymore if any cheat is set
  (oxygen, level skip, start at level)
 - added pause (P or joypad play)
 - added speed regulation (game was too fast on some machines)
 - added reverse+forward+yellow: quit to workbench
 - added selectable start level
 - slave was using a wrong name for highscore files.
 - swapped CUSTOM2 and CUSTOM3 (CUSTOM2 now enables arcade style controls)
 - reworked/cleaned up source code
 - hopefully fixed controls (issue #0004766)

Version 2.2 (StingRay)
- Patch was broken since v2.1 and crashed with access fault shortly
  after the title screen, buggy menu patch fixed
- Copperlist problems fixed

Version 2.1 (Hungry Horace)
- Configuration features for WHDLoad v17 added
- Fixed 68000 specific bug causing a black screen on game loadin
 
 version 2.0 (16.11.2008) done by Hungry Horace
 - Load / Save scores to HD (file 'highs')
 - Highscore saving is disabled if either CUSTOM1 tooltype or the
   original game cheat are used.
 - Game now returns to the highscore table after game completion,
   instead of the menu screen.
 - After completing the game the round number for game completion
   is entered as "END".
 - Highscore table delete function now fixed to three characters
   to prevent overwriting of score.
 - Blitter waits adjusted to make speed closer to the original.
 - Loop which locks the game where no sound is enabled (emulation)
   is now removed.
 - JST source level emulation removed (JOTD) so HH can improve the
   patch in a full WHDLoad source fashion.
 - Install script & readme rewritten to fit WHDLoad standards (JOTD)
 - Trainers on CUSTOM1 can be combined (added) for multiple trainers:
   - CUSTOM1=1 - Infinite Lives
   - CUSTOM1=2 - Infinite Oxygen
   - CUSTOM1=4 - Enables Levelskip (Help key, original cheat)
   - CUSTOM1=8 - Enables cheat with only one key

 - CUSTOM2=1 enables the "fast cheater" - press any key to enable
    the original game cheat.
 - "Fast cheater" now supports both game versions

 - CUSTOM3=1 enables two button support
 - This operates exactly like the arcade version;
   - Jump is now activated by the second button and not "up".
   - Upwards movement of a balloon or rider is activated by the
   second button.
   - After collecting the Joystick item, or riding the spaceship,
   the joystick up control is used.

 - CUSTOM4=1 enables the music player
   - Press any key on the number line (starting at 1 and ending with 
     the plus key) to activate any of the game music.
   - This tooltype overwrites and disables the easy-cheater on CUSTOM2
