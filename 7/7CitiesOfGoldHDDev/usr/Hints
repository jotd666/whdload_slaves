                         SEVEN CITIES OF GOLD

Typed in by APPLE REBEL. Edited by Parasite.
 
 
IN EUROPE
THE COURT - NOT EVERY VISIT TO THE PALACE WILL THRILL YA WITH THE SAME
EXULTATION AS THE FIRST. NEVERTHELESS, HERE YOU MUST RETURN FOR RECOGNITION
OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS, FOR THE GLORY AND POWER OF TITLES, PERHAPS FOR MORE
GOLD DESPERATELY NEEDED TO CONTINUE YOUR SEARCH.
 
HOME - HERE IN PRIVATE YOU MAY LOOK AT YOUR SUCCESSES AND FAILURES AND STUDY
THE MAPS YOU'VE CREATED ON YOUR JOURNEYS. HERE YOU CAN ALSO JUDGE THE
PROGRESS YOU'RE MAKING TOWARD YOUR GOALS - HOW MUCH LAND AND HOW MANY
RIVERS YOU'VE EXPLORED, HOW MANY  NATIVES YOU'VE ENOUNTERED AND HOW MANY
SPECIAL LANDMARKS (GREAT LAKES, LUSH JUNGLES, ETC...) YOU'VE FOUND. YOU MAY
LEARN HOW MANY MISSIONS YOU'VE ESTABLISHED AND HOW MUCH GOLD YOU'VE FOUND
THAN YOU'VE SPENT.
 
LISTED, EXCEPT MISSIONS AND LIVES, INGRANTING TITLES. THE HIGHEST RANK,
VICEROY, IS RESERVED FOR THOSE WHO CAN ACHIEVE AN OVERALL RATING OF AT LEAST
50% BY 1540. (LOSING AN EXPEDITION COMPLETELY - DYING - COSTS YOU THE MAPS
AND DISCOVERIES MADE SINCE THE LAST TIME YOU STOPPED AT THE PUB. IT ALSO
COSTS YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET FUTURE CREDIT AND YOU LOSE A YEAR AND HALF
OF YOUR VALUABLE TIME.)
 
THE OUTFITTERS - IT'S HERE THAT YOU'LL SPEND YOUR GOLD TO EQUIP AND PROVISION
YOUR EXPEDITIONS. TIP - FOOD IS BOUGHT AND BARTERED FOR IN RELATION TO THE
NUMBER OF MEN IN YOUR EXPEDITION. DECIDE ON THE NUMBER OF MEN YOU WANT
FIRST, THEN ON HOW MANY WEEKS WORTH OF FOOD YOU'LL NEED.
 
THE PUB - WISE CONQUISTADORS WILL STOP BY HERE AFTER EVERY TRIP TO RECORD
THEIR MAPS AND DISCOVERIES.
 
THE EXPEDITION

THE VOYAGE - WHEN YOU LEAVE PORT, MARK WELL THE INDICATIONS OF YOUR VOYAGE &
HOW THEY CONSTANTLY CHANGE. ON THE SCREEN, N=TOP, W=LEFT. AT THE TOP OF
THE SCREEN YOU'LL SEE THE MONTH AND YEAR AND NUMBER OF VESSELS STILL IN
YOUR EXPEDITION. TO THE LEFT IS THE SIZE OF YOUR ARMY AND THE NUMBER OF
WEEKS YOU CAN FEED THEM. TO THE RIGHT IS THE LEDGER OF YOUR CARGO GOODS AND
GOLD. AT THE BOTTOM IS YOUR SPEED.

THE SHIP'S CARTOGRAPHER CAN HELP YOU A LOT IN YOUR SEARCH. CHOOSE THE 'VIEW
MAP' OPTION TO LEARN YOUR LATITUDE AND AND PAY ATTENTION TO PASSAGE OF TIME.
 THERE ARE MANY PERILS IN THE WATERS BEYOND SPAIN. MEN DIE OF SCURVY OR OF
STORMS. THOSE SAME STORMS CAN BLOW YOU FOR OFF COURSE AND COST VITAL TIME.
YOUR FOOD SUPPLY DWINDLES AS YOU PLY YOUR WAY ACROSS THE OCEAN. WANDER TOO
LONG IS SEARCH OF LAND, AND YOU WILL SURELY BITE THE DUST.
 
DISCOVERY AND EXPLORATION - BRING YOUR SHIPS INTO SAFE MOORING CAREFULLY AND
LEARN FROM YOUR COSTLY MISTAKES. DONT LOSE YOUR SHIPS THE SAME WAY YOU DID
BEFORE: RUNNING AGROUND, STORMS, ETC.. REMEMBER ALSO IF YOU LEAVE YOUR SHIPS
UNATTENDED WHILE YOU SET OFF ON LONG JOURNEYS, THE SAILORS (WHO AREN'T
INCLUDED IN YOUR ROSTER COUNT) JUST MIGHT SAIL AWAY BEFORE YOU RETURN.
 THE CHURCH HAS A POWERFUL ALLY IN YOUR NEED FOR FOOD AND SOMEONE TO HELP
CARRY IT. UNLESS YOU FIND AND LEARN TO DEAL WITH SOME LOCAL INHABITANTS, 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET VERY FAR IN YOUR QUEST.
 
TIPS - (1). YOUR OWN PROGRESS DEPENDS ON YOUR USE OF RIVERS - A MODERATE
PACE ON A RIVER MOVES YOU AS FAST AS A RECKLESS PACE ON LAND.
       (2). YOUR COMPUTER WILL BUILD MAPS FOR YOU AS YOU GO. USE THEM OFTEN.
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO USEFUL PLACES AND AVOID THE
DANGEROUS ONES. (ONE SCREEN MEASURES 120 MILES ON A SIDE ON THE EXPLORATION
MAPS.)
 
THE NATIVES
MAKING CONTACT W/NATIVES - IN ANY REGION, WHERE THE NATIVES LIVE WILL NOT
BE VISIBLE UNLESS YOU LOOK FOR SIGNS. WHEN YOU ENTER A VILLAGE, THINK OF HOW
YOU WANT TO ACT. RECKLESS AGRESSION? OPEN-HANDED GENEROSITY? ETC..
 THERE WILL BE A VARIETY IN THE NATIVES YOU ENCOUNTER. SOME WILL BE MORE
POPULOUS, SOME MORE CREDULOUS, SOME  HOSTILE, AND SOME MORE COMPLEX 
COMBINATIONS OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES.
 
TRADE OR CONQUEST - BOTH ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU. BOTH, IS SUCCESSFUL, BRING 
VALUABLE BEARERS AS WELL AS GOODS. TO TRADE, AS THE NATIVES WILL BE QUICK TO
TELL (IF YOUR GAIT AND PERHAPS YOUR GENEROSITY SEEM SUITABLE), YOU MUST
DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THE CHIEF. HE ALWAYS STANDS IN THE CENTER OF THE VILLAGE
UNTIL AN AGRESSIVE THREAT CAUSES HIM TO VANISH OR YIELD IN DESPAIR.
 CONQUEST IS QUICK, BUT CONSUMES LIVES. TRADING IS SAFER, BUT IT'S ALSO 
SLOWER AND REQUIRES MANY GOODS. 
 
ESTABLISHING FORTS & MISSIONS - BOTH TRADE AND CONQUEST CAN BRING YOU THE
OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH A MISSION ON THE SITE. HOW MANY MEN YOU MUST LEAVE
TO ESTABLISH MORE THAN A THINLY MANNED FORT, AND HOW FEW TO AVOID AN OVER-
GARRISONED ARMORY, WILL DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE NATIVE POPULATION AT THE

AND MISSION BE YOUR GUIDE AND LET EXPERIENCE TELL YOU HOW EAGER THE
CONQUERED ARE WILLINGTO REVOLT DURING YOUR ABSENCE.
 
PLAYING TIPS 
(1). PAY ATTENTION TO THE TIME OF YEAR AND TO YOUR LATITUDE.
TOWARD THE NORTH AND FAR SOUTH, THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE BECOME VISIBLE IN
THE FALL, WINTER AND SPRING. AND, SINCE HOW MUCH FOOD YOU'LL FIND IN A
VILLAGE DEPENDS ON WHEN THE LAST HARVEST WAS, YOU'LL FIND PAYING ATTENTION 
TO THE SEASONS IMPORTANT.
(2). DONT UNDER ESTIMATE NATIVE COMMUNICATIONS. SOME CAN SPREAD WORD OF
YOUR ACTIVITIES TO CITIES YOU HAVEN'T VISITED YET. AND BEARERS CAN SHOW YOU
THE LOCATION OF OTHER SETTLEMENTS - AND OF TREASURES, IF YOU PAUSE LONG 
ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO THEM.
(3). A MISSION CAN SUPPLY NEARBY SHIPS AND CAUSE THE SAILORS TO WAIT 
PATIENTLY FOR THE RETURN OF THE LANDING PARTY, PROVIDED CARE HAS BEEN TAKEN
TO INFORM THE MISSION INHABITANTS OF THE LOCATION OF THE SHIPS.
 
1540 AND BEYOND - YOU MAY CONTINUE YOUR EXPLORATIONS AFTER 150 IF YOU WISH, 
BUT YOU'LL RECEIVE NO MORE TITLES FROM THE COURT OR OTHER RECOGNITION FOR
YOUR EFFORTS. 
 
ADVANCED PLAY
NOTES ON THE WORLD MAKER - THE NEW CONTINENT GENERATOR WILL CONFORM TO
BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE, MOUTAIN RANGES ARE GENERATED WHERE THE
PLATES BUMP INTO ONE ANOTHER. AND SECONDARY RANGES (LIKE THE ALLEGHENY
MTS.) MAY BE CREATED AS WELL.  THE PROGRAM ALSO CONSULTS A CULTURAL
DISSEMINATION FOR ITS WORK. THE INFLUENCES OF MAJOR CIVILIZATIONS ARE
PRESUMED TO SPREAD OUTWARD. CONSEQUENTLY, PUEBLO DWELLERS GENREALLY WILL BE
FOUND BETWEEN CITY-STATES AND PRIMITIVE AGRICULTURISTS. THE MODEL WILL ALLOW
FOR VARYING LEVELS OF THIS INFLUENCE AND THUS PRODUCE OCCASIONAL CONTINENT
ARRANGEMENTS WHICH HAVE NO INCAN LEVEL CIVILIZATIONS. IT CAN ALSO MAKE VERY
RICH AND POWERFUL ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS THE 16TH-CENTURY JAPAN, ARE HIGHLY
CIVILIZED FROM COAST TO COAST.
 
CIVILIZATIONS
1 DARK BROWN HUT = TRIBAL, POOR HUNTERS AND GATHERERS.
2 DARK BROWN HUTS = TRIBSL, RICH HUNTER AND GATHERERS.
3 LIGHT BROWN HUTS = TRIBAL, PRIMITIVE AGRICULTURE.
1 GREEN STRUCTURE = CHIEFDOM, AGRICULTURE.
1 PINK STRUCTURE = CITY-STATE CONFEDERATION, AGRICULTURE.
1 LIGHT BLUE = EMPIRE/NATION, ADVANCED AGRICULTURE.
