# W6 implementation and verification ledger

Status: **in progress**, not player-enabled. The user authorized consistent
simulation speed independent of achieved FPS and smooth 50 FPS on capable PAL
hardware. `game-time-plan.md` records the design and all acceptance gates.

## Exact clock foundation

`time-core.s` advances one unprocessed CIA interval. It retains a 128-bit
fractional world phase in units of LCM(10..80), with an exact rate table for
all supported divisors. One interval earns `1024 * LCM / F`, or eight times
that under compression; one world update spends `225 * LCM`. No fraction is
rounded or reinterpreted when F changes. The largest single-interval intermediate
fits four longwords, including a nearly full incoming phase and 8× compression.

The caller must execute all returned world updates (zero to four) before advancing
the CIA cursor again. Unprocessed CIA intervals are retained debt, not multiplied
into the bounded phase. The separate service accumulator earns 1024 and spends
2560, corresponding to 128-unit F=20 updates. It is unaffected by Time Scale or
compression. This is a clock kernel, not yet a replacement game loop.

`game_time_core.py` generates the exact constants and 426 native CPU cases.
The independent rational oracle tests every case and a 10,000-interval mixed-rate
sequence. The actual 68000 assembly executes every generated case at VERIFY
sim-v1 load and aborts on a mismatch. The kernel and vectors are currently
VERIFY-only; no new original-executable byte range is patched by this checkpoint.

The frozen foundation VERIFY image has text size 109,818 bytes and SHA256
`6e955ab6bc08c7e6a54912231d5734fba5da9f95343cce6d9bd878924c0d0654`.
A500, 68020 and cached 68030 boots completed the self-test and reached the native
flight anchor. The 68020 and 68030 completion counters were independently read
as 426. Evidence: `tmp/dev/tmp/prof/w6-core-*/`.
These are arithmetic and boot checks, not timing-mode gameplay or FPS results.
The normal and developer build hashes remain byte-identical to W5 (recorded in
`game-time.md`). Each owned emulator was quit before the next CPU capture.

A first read-only interpolation audit brackets one native `sim:0056c` render on
68030: 394 h3 bytes change, while all 280 captured player-object bytes remain
identical. The changed h3 regions still require classification, and other active
objects/camera modes are not covered by this one-frame sample. Evidence is in
`w6-core-030/render-writes/` beneath the local profile directory.

## Scheduler and input contract

`game_time_scheduler.py` is the rational scheduling oracle. Its tests cover
frame-partition independence of deadlines and input, timer wrap, exact Time Scale
changes, independent services, compression, bounded work batches, retained debt,
pause/rebase and explicit input queue overflow. It accepts a quantum parameter;
the current native arithmetic candidate uses the planned 225 units.

Input acquisition in CIA interval N assigns eligibility N+1, preserving producer
sequence for ties. Freeze the eligible input set before running that boundary's
world updates. This prevents a late keyboard IRQ from changing a second compressed
update at the same boundary differently on faster hardware. Commands are consumed
once; held state persists. Overflow must fault explicitly rather than silently
remove old events. No input implementation is claimed merely from this model.

## Next integration work and gates

1. Reserve the developer timing bit and install sim-v1 hooks with original-byte
   checks; leave the player verified mask unchanged until completion.
2. Add producer-side timestamped input, separate world and presentation ownership,
   and VERIFY logs. Cover keyboard, joystick and mouse; native input polling has
   direct hardware reads and menu side effects, so it is not IRQ-safe as a whole.
3. Split the main loop and execute due world updates in order, including its
   command/world counters and immediate mission/death exits. Keep sound service
   and timestamped menu/pause transitions responsive between bounded batches.
4. Move timed camera/repeat work to the independent service clock and message
   expiry to active-flight time, leaving dirty buffers tied to publications.
5. Add render interpolation of consecutive world states and the one-field PAL
   cap under W6. Audit native render/camera writes; drawing must never feed
   interpolated state back into physics, AI, collision or RNG.
6. Run the full state, physics/combat, input/transition, 50-FPS presentation and
   CPU-capacity matrix in `game-time-plan.md`. No release claim before these pass.

At this checkpoint 79 host tests pass. The clock self-test is not a substitute for
the eventual scheduler twin, full active-object comparisons or live interpolation
checks. W6 remains unfinished until those requirements are handled.


## Native input queue foundation

`time-input.s` implements a 256-entry FIFO with 16-byte timestamped records.
The producer publishes its wrapping sequence number only after the complete
record is stored; the consumer publishes tail only after copying a due event.
Full queues latch overflow and retain every old entry. Producers must be
serialized by the eventual IRQ wrapper; this module does not yet install input
hooks or replace native polling.

The native self-test covers two complete fills/drains, exact four-long payloads,
full-queue rejection without eviction, future/deadline eligibility, 16-bit sequence
wrap and both signed and unsigned 32-bit CIA boundaries. Modular timestamp
comparison explicitly clears subtraction overflow flags before interpreting the
signed distance. The caller requires distances below half the CIA counter range.

A500 VERIFY text size is 114,426 bytes, SHA256
`f79a037322e0c81b1874d81f51189e06a73324044838495713a698b4ed9caea8`.
It reaches native flight with completion counters **426 clock cases and 512 input
events**. The counters were read from the saved RAM snapshot after checking an
exact match of its live marker against all twelve flight-entry metadata fields.
The first live collector failed on a non-UTF-8 copyright byte in the assembler
listing; that collector was corrected, and the retained snapshot avoids requiring
another boot. Evidence: `tmp/dev/tmp/prof/w6-input-a500/selftest-result.json`.

The test buffer and kernel remain VERIFY-only. This is sequential native FIFO
verification, not a claim of live interrupt interleaving, device capture or an
implemented game scheduler. The owned emulator is shut down.


## Keyboard acquisition hook

VERIFY CUSTOM5 bit 20 installs a checked six-byte replacement for the relocated
LEA at `sim:308b6`. Its IRQ wrapper timestamps the decoded transition for the next
CIA boundary, appends the event and restores all incoming registers/flags except
a0, which receives the original keyboard bitmap address. Native code at
`sim:308bc` then performs its original bitmap store and key-command FIFO handling.
The observer does not consume or replace native input. CUSTOM5 bit 21 enables a
four-transition supervisor-VBlank fixture (Right down/up, Fire down/up) through
the actual installed hook and original decoded-key tail. It does not cover the
host key mapping or the CIA serial handshake.

The 68030 fixture uses VERIFY SHA256
`634ca59a93848d7114673787cf049afece305e5e658f28fb3cc15cd4d674d2f5`,
text 118,982 bytes. Four independently logged acquisition timestamps match their
queued eligibility boundaries exactly at acquisition+1. Head/high-water are four,
tail is zero, and overflow is clear. Four debugger entry/exit register pairs verify
all exposed registers and status flags, with only the expected a0 and PC changes.
The native hook's instruction/branch/relocation audit reports zero errors.
Evidence: `tmp/dev/tmp/prof/w6-input-fixture-030/`. `input_events.py` rejects wrong
deadlines, overflow and extra/contaminating events rather than filtering them out.

All 82 host checks pass. This proves the observed keyboard producer contract;
it does not yet connect keyboard events to world ticks, capture mouse/joystick,
or implement the gameplay loop. The owned test emulator is shut down.
