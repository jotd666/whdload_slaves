(Here's some docs for this game i found on some ibm board... blah blah blah..)
(they are probably totally un-useful, so don't even read them! later! [RYGAR])

I have been waiting for this one since it was announced, and it looks
like it was well worth it, full 256 color 451 only graphics. And it is quite
responsive and playable unlike some 451 games released to date. It has better
graphics than Knights of the Sky and better playability than Blue Max. So
after playing it for an hour or so I made up some quick doc's. These are by no
means complete but will get you started until the real doc's come out (if they
do)

Flight Controls:

+ & - on Keypad 1-8 on keyboard              throttle
Space                                        fire guns
Return & second joystick button              switch between inside and outside  
                                             views

U			      Un-jam guns (if jammed)                             
C			      Time compression on/off(only when not in battle)
M & A                         Communicates with wingman
Q & ESC                       End mission


Keypad and arrows control plane, you can select joystick just by pressing 
any button at the title screen.

ALT-Q                         Quit to DOS
ALT-R                         Brings up realism menu
ALT-J                         Enable/Disable joystick
ALT-D                         Enable/Disable mouse
ALT-S                         Enable/Disable sound
Views:

F1                            View from cockpit
F2  			      Rear view
F3 			      Left
F4			      Right
F5                            Look up
F6                            Look down
F7                            Battlefield view of plane from rear
F10                           Preference menu

While in outside views mode (Return) hitting the Function keys will shows 
various views			

If your plane is hit, damage will acumulate by showing your wing-spars being
shot, if they break, you are dead. 

Also, you can change various aspects of the mission while in the briefing mode
by moving the pointer over the raised lettering, you can change weather,
planes and the enemy doing this.

Also you can use the mission recorder to play back old missions and re-fly them
again and again

Hints:

While in a dogfight, turn, turn and turn again, don't stay level! the Zepplins
are the hardest for me, I have yet to shoot one down.

This one will take a while to play, it has to be the best simulation made yet.
All the options allow you to virtually change everything!

Greets to Doctor PJ, Byter, Phantom, Slavelord (nice release), Michael Myers
and all the PoWR crew! ESp. GREETINGS TO RYGAR FOR BEING SO COOL
