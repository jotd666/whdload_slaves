 This install applies to "Red Zone" © 1992 Psygnosis

 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

 thanks:

 - Bored Seal for providing me WARPS of this game (through Angus, I believe)
 - All the WHDLoad team for interesting discussions and support
 - Bert for fixing the SMC detection in WHDLoad

 notes:

 - This game is lame, slow, jerky, detects 68020+ CPU but on the other hand uses
   a lot of self modifying code, and runs in chipmem only: worst configuration for
   a 3D game !!! Shame on the coders.
 - Needs RawDIC v4.0
