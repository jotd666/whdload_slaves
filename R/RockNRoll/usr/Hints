                        ROCK'N'ROLL - HINTS

You can warp from level 6 to level 8 by placing three platforms in the
correct positions. The action takes place in an area with many ventilators,
where the railing is missing in the lower right corner. If you place one
platform in each row, the warp will be activated.

You can warp from level 4 to level 11 by smashing all eggs. To get to the
egg-area, you must buy one repair-set and place it to the right of the
middle arrow. Then, it is possible to roll straight on over the abyss until
you reach the egg-area.

You can warp from level 14 to level 18 by smashing the correct eggs. In the
big egg-area you have to roll an >M< into the seperated, upper left zone and
a >G< into the seperated zone to the right. You are not allowed to smash any
other egg.

You can warp from level 2 to level 20 by smashing the correct eggs. In the
egg-area you have to smash all eggs near the railing. You are not allowed to
smash any other egg.

You can warp from level 3 to level 24 by placing three platforms in the
correct positions. Near to the starting point, you will find three repair-set
shops and to the right a small abyss-area. Warp is activated by placing all
three platforms in the middle row.

You can warp from level 27 to level 7 > NO JOKE < by pushing four small balls
into the correct positions. Each ball has to be pushed into the abyss in the
center of its edge.

You can warp from level 7 to level 30 by pushing two small balls into the
correct positions. To enter the ball-area, you need one bomb, which you get
automatically when warping. You can warp from level 27 to 7. In this area, you
have to push the left ball to the left into abyss and the right ball to the
right into abyss.

You can enter the BONUS LEVEL 33 by repairing the hole on the right side of
level one (it's the one you don't fall in when rolling over it).
