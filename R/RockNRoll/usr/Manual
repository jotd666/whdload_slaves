  Welcome to the world of Rock'n Roll! You are at the beginning of an 
  exciting adventure, set in a strange and foreign world, during which
  you will be confronted by both good and evil with plenty of challenges
  and surprises to keep you busy. Rock'n Roll is filled with crazy yet
  unique action, with ten great Rock'n Roll tracks and a massive overall
  hi-score table. Your task is to guide a ferocious rolling ball through
  a total of 32 levels and seven continents, each with it's own particular
  peculiarities, signature tune and landscape. The path is marked, but 
  watch out for secret shortcuts and obstacles that deduct energy from
  your ball. And, beware that the ball doesn't fall into the precipice!



                               Introduction :
                            --------------------

  Welcome to the world of Rock'n Roll, which is constituted of 7 continents,
  each with its own particular peculiarities, signature tune and landscape.

  Your task is to guide the ball through a total of 32 levels. The path is 
  marked but watch out for rumours giving tips regarding secret short-cuts.
  Fundamentally, there are three things which you must be aware of in
  order to reach the finish unscathed. Firstly, certain obstacles will 
  deduct energy from your ball. Secondly, the ball must not be allowed 
  to fall into the precipice. And, thirdly, there is a time limit in some
  zones, so move fast!

  If you solve certain puzzles in some zones you will be rewarded with a 
  variety of bonuses, all will be revealed as you progress.


                                 Loading :
                              ---------------

  a) Set up your Amiga in the usual way. Refer to your User's manual if
     required.
  b) Switch on your monitor or TV, then your Amiga. Place the program
     disk in the drive. After a brief period the game will begin to load.

  [Returning of defective disks omitted.]


                                Controls :
                             ----------------

  In this game, you can only control the ball with a mouse. Keyboard and
  joystick controls are not available. The faster the mouse is moved in
  a given direction, the faster the ball will roll across the landscape.
  Extra options may be accessed by pressing the right mouse button, and
  utilized by pressing the left one. Key 'F1' turns music on/off; 'F2'
  turns sound effects on/off; Esc restarts the level less one life and
  Delete ends the game.


                          Building and blasting :
                       -----------------------------

  To build a path, select the appropriate 'extra' symbol. Then, keeping
  the left mouse button pressed, roll the ball over the area you wish to
  build the path. To explode a bomb simply select the bomb symbol, and
  press the left mouse button when the ball is situated on the spot you
  wish the bomb to explode. The bomb is automatically lit and will 
  explode shortly afterwards.

                            Features and Tips :
                         -------------------------

Shopping Tips :

  To buy an extra you must simply roll the ball over the appropriate symbol.
  The price is shown to the right of the symbol.The money will be booked
  from your accound and the shop will then close. If you haven't got enough
  money to pay for the extra, there is an alternative. It is possible to pay
  with energy. To make such a risky deal the ball needs to remain on the
  symbol for few seconds. Only than will such an errangement be accepted
  (providing you have enough energy).

Speed Up :

  The right tip for all high-speed freaks. Whoever shops here will armour
  their ball with effective additional power. Up to four of these 'Speed-
  Ups's' can be used simultaneously. Unfortu-nately this speed-thrill re-
  mains for only 90 seconds, after which the ball will change down a grear.

Armor :

  High-Tech makes it possible ! If you go for this extra your ball will be
  wrapped in a tough, protecting shell for a short period of time. Although
  the ball cannot penetrate the normal barriers, fragile ones are no longer
  problematic obstacles.

Repair-Set :

  Unfortunately some of the tracks may be interrupted. This is where the re-
  pair-sets come in useful with which you can build a new path. You should
  use these repair-sets sparingly as there are seldom more sets than are ab-
  solutely necessary ....... !

Parachute :

  Despite the fact that parachuting may not be your favorite passtime, you
  will soon learn to value them very much ! They can be your last hope when
  you roll off of the path into the precipice. If you react fast enough and
  open the parachute before the ball hits the ground, you will once again
  have saved a life.

Continue :

  If you should be lucky enough to come across one of these shops, don't
  stop to think. If you possess one of these powerful extras, you are able
  to continue playing in the level where you lost your last ball. Is that
  an offer ????

Bombs :

  Bombs: Warning ! Explosives ! These bombs tend to be quite dangerous but
  very effective. It's never a bad thing to have one or more of these in
  your pack. But don't hang around too long in the explosive area - that
  could be painful.... !

Spikes :

  It's no secret that control is difficult on an icy surface. Spikes with
  which it is possible to equip your ball for a short time, naturally make
  stopping easier. The question remains, through, can you buy something more
  important with your money ??

?????? :

n  Hummmmm. We didn't really want to give anything away about that. We will
  just say enough for you to know that it's always worth popping into this
  shop. Information which will make life easier will be given in return for
  an admittedly high price.

Keyboard :

  Due to circumstances beyound our control, german keyboard layout exchanging
  'Z' and 'Y' keys is active. This will in no way affect the enjoyment you
  will experience playing Rock'n'Roll.


                              Game Elements :
                           ---------------------

Keys & Doors :

  Restricting doors can be opened with the appropriate keys (distinguished
  by colour). You need only roll against the door-the door will be opened if
  the correct key is handy.

Diamonds :

  The players eyes widen in delight. These diamonds will be collected in
  your account. A red diamond is worth 300 bonus points, a yellow diamond
  is worth 700 poits, a green diamond is worth 1500 bonus points and a blue
  diamond is worth 4000 bonus points.

Ice :

  Without spikes you must be extremly careful - on ice you'll be slipping all
  over the place. Slow down !

Fragile Platforms :

  Not all platforms are plaesant. It is only possible to roll over these
  fragile platforms 1, 2 or 3 times, depending on how strong they are, after
  which they disappear. Therefore think carefully about where you roll !

Eggs :

  If you roll the ball over these eggs, you will, of course, squash them.
  It seems at first sight as though there is no adventage in this, but who
  knows... Pleasant Surprises rarely come at the wrong time.

Eyes :

  The more eyes thet are collected, the more of the level map you will be
  able to see. For technical reason this element is not available on the C64.
  
Fragil Barriers :

  Unlike the fragile platforms the fragile barriers are not unpleasant. 
  Armored balls can ram obstacles away and free a new path - who knows, 
  perhaps you'll build a short-cut.... !

Small Balls :

  These small ball are definitely not simple obstacles. A new platform will 
  always appear in the area where they are pushed over the edge into the pre-
  cipice. This is a safe, although somewhat strange way to build a new
  track.

Acid :

  Acid also has unpleasant effects on your ball. Energy-loss will result.

Bombs :

  Do not make the mistake of thinking that bombs can be exploded anywhere.
  That would be much too easy. Bombs can only be ignited on special, rein-
  forced platforms. The areas which are left after the bomb has exploded
  are not necessarily precipices. The result will be different from level
  to level.

Tubes :

  The tubes are favoured means of transport. If you roll in one side, you
  will automatically come out at the other side.

Teleports :

  The telepoter is for urgent cases. Practically without time-loss you will
  be transported to another area.

Explosions :

  You should wait for exactly the right moment to get past these obstacles.
  If you fail, you will lose energy.

Switches :

  The switchers are a devilish affair. Nobody knows the exact effect of
  each individual switch - this varies from level to level and from switch
  to switch.

Ventilators :

  In some areas a harsh wind blows. Ths tends to be due to ventilators which
  can cause gusty and uneven gales.

Magnets :

  In contrast to the ventilators which blow your ball away from them, mag-
  nets pull the ball towards them. Absolute concentration is needed to con-
  quer them.

Money :

  You will also come across problems with Rock'n Roll if you do not possess
  the appropriate change. 100, 300 or 500 coins will be credited to your
  account when you collect the respective symbols.

Arrows :

  Unpleasant are these arrows. Your ball cannot resist their influence. It
  will automatically be pushed in the direction of the arrows. Skillful
  players can perhaps overcome the power of one or two arrows which happen
  to be pointing in the wrong direction.

Energy Barriers & sliding doors :
  
  With both of these you must wait for the right moment and then speed through.


                              Hall of Fame :
                           --------------------
