Type : game/patch
Author : JOTD

Install-Script & fix © 2000-2018 JOTD

Floppy AGA version:

The patch can be applied to a already installed version of the game,
using the installer provided in the original game package.

The AGA version runs using kickstart 3.1 and needs 2 MB of chipmem and
1MB of fastmem.

The ECS version also runs using kickstart 3.1 and needs 1 MB of chipmem and
2MB of fastmem.

CD³² version:

The game can be installed using the provided install script


Bug (AGA):

- when selecting "training" at game boot, the game locks up (you can still quit to WB)
  if cinematics are on. if you play "mission briefing" once, training then works with
  cinematics.
- there are slight gfx bugs, due to fixed access faults


 History:

 Version 1.4-C (26.04.2020)
 - possible crash on 68000 if A1200 or A4000 kickstart is found
 
 Version 1.4-B (25.12.2018)
 - Forgot to allow 68000 processor in the ECS version. You'll need A600 3.1 kickstart
   to run the game (issue #0004008)
   
 Version 1.4 (03.09.2018)
 - Fixed missing sound in ECS version intro (by adding more fast memory to the slave)
 
 Version 1.3 (23.08.2018) done by JOTD
 - Added support for ECS version (thanks to Retroplay for the images)
 - source code included
 
 Version 1.2 (08.01.2006) done by JOTD
 - CD³² control method fixed (in lowlevel.s)
 - slaves converted for WHDLoad v16

 Version 1.1
 - WHDLoad slave, CD³² support as well
 - runs using KickEmu31
 - for floppy version allows to run the game from anywhere,
   which means that you don't have
   to install the game in a Rise directory directly on the root volume you
   selected during the install (you can move the dir anywhere)
 - Access faults removed in both versions
 - CACR/VBR stuff removed
 - Use of fast memory for awesome loading speed

 Version 1.0
 - floppy fix, no WHDLoad slave


Requirements:

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 (or A600 for ECS) Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000, kick40068.A600). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000, A600) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB","kick40068.A600.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.
