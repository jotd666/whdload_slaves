                         Rise of the Dragon Hint Book



                       The Making of Rise of the Dragon
                       --------------------------------

The roots of Rise of the Dragon can be traced back to a game called Project
Firestart for the Commodore 64. Released in September 1988, this was Dynamix's
first tentative step into the world of interactive entertainment.  Project
Firestart incorporated many new aspects of design and production which have
been built upon in more recent products. Innovative approaches in Firestart
included the use of cinematic effects, video images, and complicated animation
sequences.

Shoehorning the complex Firestart design into 64k was an impressive
technological accomplishment, but it also caused the project to run more than
a year behind schedule and nearly gave the lead programmer on the project a
nervous breakdown.

Despite the difficulties we encountered making Firestart, we were convinced
it was a step in the right direction for product development. So,with a bit of
experience under our belts,we decided to move on to bigger and better things
in interactive entertainment.

The original story concept behind Rise of the Dragon was developed in late
summer 1988 by David Selle and Jeff Tunnell.

After some preliminary design work, it was clear that Dragon was going to be
bigger than anthing Dynamix had yet attempted. What we were discussing was not
just a new kind of game, but an entirely new way of making them.

We realized we needed to create a completely new development enviornment
which could handle projects of this magnitude.  But, with the experience of
Project Firestart fresh in our minds,it was apparent that we were not going to
be able to build the product we wanted on the hardware which was currently
available.

Reluctantly, Dragon was placed on the back burner to wait for technology to
catch up with us.  In the meantime we took an intermediate step forward with
David Wolf: Secret Agent.

Many of the individual software tools which were incorporated into the
system used on Rise of the Dragon were created during the development of David
Wolf! Secret Agent.  Another positive event which took place during the
development of Agent was that better and more powerful hardware was becoming
available for home use.

With the increase in the number of 386 machines on the market, VGA
graphics, and improvements in our own in-house video and sound technology,
we became more confident we could begin to build the product we wanted by
the end of 1989.  This provided the impetus for the development of the
Dynamix Game Development System (DGDS).

The DGDS concept is the brainchild of Dynamix president Jeff Tunnell.
He envisioned this system as the way to build the next generation of Dynamix
computer adventure software.  DGDS provides a new way to build games and a
new way to play them.  On the programming side, it allows artists,
programmers. and writer to work on a project simultaneously in the same
development enviornment.  For the player, its main purpose is to create
games that are easy to play while providing a powerful way to interact with
the game enviornment.  DGDS accomplishes this without forcing the player to
struggle with a parser.

Dragon's intuitive DGDS point-and-click interface has all the depth and
complexity of traditional adventures games without the frustration often
associated with them.

As an adventure game Rise of the Dragon is unique in its implementation
and its conception.  It is not aimed at the younger market.  We wanted
Dragon to have a gritty, dark tone in the tradition of Blade Runner and the
William Gibson novels.  Designer Jeff Tunnell's catch phrase was "Cyberpunk
untouchables" during the early phases of development.  This design
philosophy combined with DGDS enabled us to create a truly unique interactive
computer adventure.

A typical scene is put together for Rise of the Dragon in several
stages.  First, storyboard sketches are craeted from the original story text
as called for by the design.  Then, after deciding on the look and feel of a
given scene, a background is hand-painted and scanned into the computer.
Next, ambient animations are added to the backgrounds.  One unique feature
of Dragon is that there are animations in every scene.  Some scenes in Rise
have over two hundred animations in them, each randomly generated.  The
individual animation sequences can be digitised from hand renderings, video
or deveoped wholly on the computer.

During the next phase of development, text is imported through a special
interpreter.  Finally, programmers hard code special cases for individual
scenes and implement the game logic to tie everything together.  The last
hurdle is Quality Assurance (QA).  Our QA depatment spent 1,000 hours
testing Dragon to make sure the final product was bug free.

Rise of the Dragon required 11,000 man hours (about five years) of
development time by programmers, artists, writers, sound technicians,
testers and support personnel.  There are 105 scenes, 26,000 pieces of text
and more than 12,500 individual animations in Rise of the Dragon.  Whew!



                                 Introduction
                                 ------------

              Welcome to the world of Blade Hunter, Private Eye! 

We hope you have as much fun playing this game as we did creating it.
Rise of the Dragon: A Blade Hunter Mystery is a non-linear interactive
adevnture game which allows you to follow multiple solution paths to resolve
the game.  If you have a problem that isn't mentioned here, feel free to
contact Dynamix/Sierra at (209) 683-8989 8 A.M.-5 P.M. Pacific Time.

The whole point of playing Rise of the Dragon is to discover puzzels and
find the solution to them in a limited amount of time.  However, some
puzzles may be extremely well hidden, or so arcane that you haven't any idea
where to begin.  Or, this may be your first experience with an adventure
game.  Don't feel bad if you occasionally get stuck.

                         How to use a solution manual

When you get stuck, look through this manual for a question close to
your problem.  Since the hints are organized from "slightly helpful" to
"here's a big clue" to "Smack! Here's the answer!" you should read them
individually and in sequence.  Place your "Adventure Window Card" over each
answer to read it.

                       How NOT to use a solution manual

Use this book only for the hints you really need.  It defeats the purpose
of playing an adventure game if you simply read this manual cover to cover
and learn all the answers.

                     If you've finished Rise of the Dragon

Even if after you've "won" the game, we're sure we can interest you in
playing again.  There are several different ways to resolve Rise of the
Dragon depending on the choices you make.  You may want to go back and try
some different approaches to the puzzles and possibly arrive at the happier
ending.  You may also want to try some things "just to see what happens."

If you enjoyed this game, you might like to try some of the 3-D graphic
animated adventure games produced by Sierra.  Stay tuned for future Blade
Hunter Mysteries from Dynamix as well.

              Good luck in your adventuring and we hope you enjoy
                              Rise of the Dragon!



                               GENERAL QUESTIONS
                               -----------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't figure this out!  What kind of fun is this?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read the documentation carefully, especially the "user walk through."

Examine each new room carefully using the LOOK function.

Search Blade's apartment throughly.

Play the messages on Blade's VidPhone, and re-check your machine regularly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the point of this game anyway?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are William 'Blade' Hunter, a burned out former police detective turned
private investigator.  You have been hired by your former boss, now the
mayor, to investigate the death of his daughter without causing unnecessary
publicity.

There are more than one possible solution path for this game.  Here are some
general hints to get you started.

Look at everyone and everything in the game.  Clues to puzzles and hidden
objects can sometimes be found this way.

Talk to everyone you meet.  If you leave a scene for a time and then come
back, try talking to them again.

Take anything that's not nailed down.  Chances are it will help you later on
(then again, it may not).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's August second and I can't find anything to do!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you seen the mayor?

Have you talked to the Jank?

There is a period of time when you might have to wait for the Jake to call
you at your apartment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When I try to exit an area entire rooms are bypassed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The detail setting is on MINIMUM.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every time I go anywhere I get arrested!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Try getting dressed before you go out.  Remember, you are Blade.

Your clothes are on the floor and his overcoat is hung up.

Your clothes have to be worn, not just placed in inventory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't find Blade's gun.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's not far from the ammo pack.

It's hidden under/behind/in something (the cursor icon won't change).

Where does James Bond keep his gun at night?

Search the bedding in Blade's apartment.

Look under your pillow.

Sometimes you're better off if you don't have a gun with you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't find the keys to my cupboard.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Someone else has them.

Read your VidPhone messages.

Visit City Hall.

Go to the Bureau of Records.

Get them from Karyn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm locked out of my apartment.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oops! You must have left your ID card in the VidPhone.

There is another tricky way to get back in.

Try to short out the door mechanism.

Look on the ceiling of the hallway.

Open the steam valve.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What am I supposed to do at Karyn's?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely nothing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't find "the Jake."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read your VidPhone messages.

Ask the patrons in the Pleasure Dome.

Check out the people in the bar.

Ask Mujalambo.

Talk to the man in the green coat at the end of the bar.

The man in the green coat is the Jake, but he won't admit it unless you
approach him correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found "the Jake" but he won't give me any useful information.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Save the game right before you talk to him and experiment with different
responses.

The photograph of the mayor's daughter will help you out here.

Try this sequence of responses on your first encounter with the Jake (if
you've already visited him this will change).

#1 I'm looking for the Jake.

#2 A friend of his is in some trouble.

#2 Chandra Compton.

#2 Let's say you have a lot of freinds... minus one.

Give photo of Chandra (from your VidPhone) to the Jake for proof.

#2 Who is Chen?

#3 You think Chandra would want you covering this guy's ass?

#3 I don't know, but someone does.  Why don't you help me out?

#3 What's this guy's name and address?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was arrested at Chen Lu's, and when I returned I couldn't get back inside
his apartment.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to avoid being arrested in the first placeif you move quickly
enough.

Chen's ID card will open the door lock.

You can blow the door open with a bomb, but the neighbors will hear the
explosion and call the police.

The best strategy is to get Chen's ID card from his VidPhone, leave before
the police get there and then return after they're gone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't find anything at Chen Lu's.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read Chen Lu's VidPhone messages.

Search the bathroom carefully.

LOOK at the statue in Chen's bedroom.

Take Chen's ID card from the VidPhone terminal.

Check the bathroom counter.

Click on the Dragon's right eye.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found a safe but I can't open it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are four digits in the safe combination.

You could always blow it open with a bomb.

Examine Chen Lu's VidPhone for a clue to the combination.

Look at Chen's ID number and gun permit.

The safe combination is the last four numbers of Chen's gun permit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found some items at Chen's but I don't know what I should do with them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need another person's help to get more information about them.

Preferably someone with a computer.

Someone who works for the city and has access to the Bureau of Records
databank.

Somone with the initials K.S.

Show Chen's ID card and the drug patch to Karyn.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karyn is mad at me.  How can I patch things up?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do something nice for her.

Get her a present and apologize.

Try the flower stand outside City Hall.

Buy a dozen roses, give them to Karyn and reschedule your date.Note: this will
only work once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to buy some flowers but Bliss at the flower stand won't accept cash.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's O.K. because you don't have any.

You need a credit (ID) card.

The ID card is in your VidPhone at your apartment.

Use the following response with Bliss when she suggests you buy your lady
friend some flowers and apologize.

#2 Good idea.  I'll take a dozen long stem roses.

Give her your ID card.

Bliss will then give you the flowers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karyn is so mad all she does is scream at me.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Did you try to pick up Candi?  Bad move, Blade.

Did you skin out on your second date?  Also very bad.

If you cheated on her or stood her up a second time there is no way she will
forgive you (unless you were in jail).

Seriously.

If she has already given you information concerning the lab report and Chen
you may still be able to win the game without her help.

Start over.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slen and Arreis snagged my gun and they won't give it back!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
oops!  You made a mistake!

If you only lost your pistol you can live without it.

You should be nice to the guards when you first meet them.

You need to get a claim ticket from the ticket window immediately after you
give up your gun.

Try bribing the guards.

Bribe the guards with a candy bar.

Try the following procedure when you initally encounter Slen and Arreis.  (By
the way, Arreis spelled backwords is the name of a well known software
development company.)  After they scan you, choose response #2: "No problem.
Take good care of them." Then, after Slen says "Nice piece. Be a pity to lose
it." give him the candy bar.  Now pick up your claim check and put it in
inventory.Give the lady at the ticket window thestub when you leave and she'll
return your weapon(s).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jenni won't let me in to see the Mayor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to give Mayor Vincenzi a good reason to see you.

Yelling may be effective if you have something to back it up.

Something Karyn gives you may be just the ticket.

Get the lab analysis tape for the drug patch from Karyn and ask Jenni to let
you see the mayor.

Try the following responses with Jenni, once you have the lab report tape.

#1 I need to see the mayor about an urgent matter.

#1 Damnit Jenni!  Tell him I want to see him - NOW!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mayor threw me in jail!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Try to be a little more cooperative.

Don't threaten him too much.

Give him what he wants.
Let Mayor Vincenzi have the MTZ tape.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deputy Van Halen won't let me into the armory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to get a special pass.

A person high up in the city government might be able to pull a few strings
for you.

The mayor might give you a pass.

Once you get in to see the mayor, try the following responses.

#3 You should show a little more courtesy to someone who has

   information that could cost you the nest election.

#2 I found out who killed your daughter.

#2 No effin' way.  I'm finished with this crap.  Show me the door.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
O.K. I'm on the street at Jonny Qwong's, now what?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A frontal attack won't work, but there is another way.

Look around the scene carefully.

The answer may be right at your feet.

Try the manhole.

It might be a good idea to save your game here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I found the VidPhone access panel, but I can't open it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to use something on the lock.

Subtlety isn't called for here and it doesn't matter if anyone hears you.

Blow the sucker open with a bomb.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where the heck are the bombs?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
They are inside something else.

That something else is locked.

They're in your apartment.

Check the cupboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I got the VidPhone maintenance panel open, but I don't know what I should do
next.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read the documentation and the detective handbook section on "VidPhone
maintenance."

You need a piece of equipment here.

A wire tester would be nice.

Look at the schematic on the outside of the panel.

Hook up the red positive lead to the battery terminal, the blue lead to the
ground.  Connect the yellow lead to the second brass wire terminal from the
bottom.  The wire terminals are located toward the right-hand side of the open
panel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where is the wire tester?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is inside something else.

That something else is locked.

It's in your apartment.

Check the cupboard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I keep getting zapped when I'm working on the VidPhone panel!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Be more careful.  After all, you are messing around with a high-voltage
electrical system while standing in two feet of water.

If the wire tester indicator light turns red, disconnect at least one of the
leads immediately.

Look at the voltage regulators before you try to place a tester lead.

If you try to place one of leads while the gauges are in the red you will get
fried.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How do I avoid the sewer rats?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hurry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What should I do at the warehouse?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pay attention to the "meanwhile" screens.

Take a closer look at the reactor cooling system sub-panel.

It would throw a real wrench into the works if the warehouse were to be, shall
we say, "shut down."

A bomb might come in handy here.

Place a bomb on the second electrical trunk from the left and stand back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gate is closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patience, it will open again later.

Have you tapped Jonny Qwong's VidPhone?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What's the deal with the piece of paper that has unintelligible Chinese
calligraphy on it?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karyn will give you a small hint about it.

It is not unintelligible to someone who reads Chinese.

Check out the warehouse district.

Look for an alley.

Show it to an old man sitting on a crate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I went to the reservoir but nobody was there.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Come back later.

Be patient, it will take Deng awhile to get all his units in position.

Pay close attention to the "meanwhile" screens.

Deng Hwang will deploy his strike units to the reservoir between 7:00 pm and
10:00 pm on August fourth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't get off the ground in the hovercar.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Click on the map at the center of the console between the driver and passenger
seats. This will bring up a holo-map similar to the one at the Em-Way.Select a
location and click on it.  The computer will automatically take you to your
destination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karyn has been kidnapped. Help!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to find out where she is.

Tapping Jonny Qwong's VidPhone might be helpful.

Check your VidPhone messages after you have tapped Jonny Qwong's line.

She is at Deng Hwang's, but you must set and pick up the VidPhone taps from Jonny
Qwong's to discover the address.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The snake keeps killing me in the warehouse district while holding the Jake
hostage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Try arming yourself with a gun.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The guard outside of DH Enterprises won't let me in.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is more than one way to get past him.

Bombs, bullets, and gas are all useless.

You need the correct ID card.

You need Snake's ID card.

Snake will be in the warehouse district after the Jake calls you on the
VidPhone.

You can land the hovercraft on the roof of the compound, bypassing the first
layer of security.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm in the lobby at DH Enterprises, what now?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need to get further inside the complex to rescue Karyn.

The laser gate and security alarm must be shut off.

You must get past the receptionist and into the security room.

Lie, lie, lie to the receptionist.

Try posing as a repairman.

If all else fails, use NaPent on the receptionist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I made it into the security room but I was beaten to a bloody pulp by the
guards.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DO NOT open the door to the break room.

Sooner or later the receptionist out front will figure out what's really going
on and press the alarm, so you need to think of a way to stall the guards.

Look the security panel over carefully.

Flip the switch marked "BREAK LOCK" up to activate it (the indicator bar above
the switch should turn green).

Turn all the other switches to the off position (red).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't figure out how to deactivate the laser gate and security alarm.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Try inserting your ID card into the console.

Didn't work?  Well at least you can try manual override?

Ever play the game Simon?

There are clues for one of the correct sequences hidden in the documentation.

If you gave the old man the parchment, he gave you one of the correct code
sequences, although you may not realize it yet.

If you are FORTUNATE, you may figure out the clue the old man gave you.

The correct sequence for manual override button 3 (far right) is.

Phase 1: yellow, red, purple, blue, white

Phase 2: yellow, red, purple, blue, white, blue, red, yellow, purple, yellow

Phase 3: yellow, red, purple, blue, white, blue, red, yellow, purple, yellow,
red, purple, blue, white, red

Make sure you turn off the laser gate!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karyn died when I tried to unhook her from the collar.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oops!

You only have a limited amount of time to free her.

You need to deactivate the collar mechanism before you try to unhook it.

If you had some wires you could try to short it out.

Look in a nearby room.

Try the janitors closet.

Place the wires over Karyn, then unhook the three collar control leads.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't find the wiring I need.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look at everything in the janitor's closet.

Look at the electrical panel on the back wall.

You will need a tool to work on the panel.

That screwdriver on the sink will help.

Make sure you throw the breaker switch on the top panel.

Use the screwdriver to remove the bottom panel.

Grab the wires.

                                  ARCADE HINTS
                                  ------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those goons at the reservoir are wiping me out.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read the documentation carefully.

Make sure your gun is loaded.

If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

Wearing a bulletproof vest will help.

Getting the rifle from the police armory will make life easier, but you can
still win without it.

Show the piece of paper to the old man in the warehouse to get the vest.

If you don't already have a rifle, make sure you pick one up after you kill
all the bad guys.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I keep getting shot to pieces by the guards!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Read the documentation section on the arcade sequences carefully.

You can duck under some of the guards bullets.

You can jump over some of the guards bullets.

Aim for the head.

A bulletproof vest will allow you to take more hits.

Shoot your gun in the direction of a guard when he is off the edge of the
screen and chase the bullet till it hits him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The hazards at the warehouse are too hard!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No they aren't!

Jump over or go around pools of toxic waste.

You can avoid leaping over some of the pits by jumping up to a loading dock
and walking across it.

Don't get sprayed by the posion gas.

Avoid the Bum-Away beams.

Make sure to duck as you pass the electric field generator.

Jump up and shoot Snake a couple of times as he is coming across the pit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm being toasted by the flame throwers!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your bulletproof vest is no good against fire.

The flame throwers go in a pattern. If you time it right you can sneak under
them.

You can get past some of the flame throwers if you use the lower level (make
sure to duck).

Some of the flame throwers have a red valve handle on them.  If you shoot the
valve it will shut the flame thrower off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can't kill Bahumat in the final arcade.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A rifle would be VERY helpful here.

You can jump over and duck under some of Bahumat's fireballs.

A bomb might come in handy if you have one left.

If you have a bomb, walk towards Bahumat while staying on the lower level and
press the action button when you are directly beneath him.  Blade will
automatically throw a bomb at Bahumat if you have any left.

                              work anymore

Background: Blade is a former police detective who was pressured to resign
from the LAPD by then police chief Giuseppe Vincenzi because of his unorthodox
methods of investigation.  Although Blade had one of the highest conviction
rates of any officer, he also was named as a defendant in more civil lawsuits
than any other officer in the history of the department.  After leaving the
force, Blade opened his own detective agency, which provided a subsistence
level of income.

Background: Karyn Sommers is Blade's sometime girlfriend.  There is genuine
affection between these two but Blade, well, he's not the most romantic man
who ever lived. His idea of a romantic evening is to split a six-pack during a

certain amount of friction in their relationship.

two men.
