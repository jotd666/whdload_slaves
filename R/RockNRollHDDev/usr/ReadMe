 This install applies to "Rock'n Roll" (c) 1989 Rainbow Arts, both original and
 rerelease version.

You will have to install it with that install to run it from hd.
That install needs WHDLoad and RawDIC in the path (eg in c:).

Default quitkey is numerical *. You may change it in the icon with QUITKEY= .

Notes: 	Try COUNTRY or MAGIC MAP instead of your name, or the levelchoice
	with RAINBOW ARTS.
    New version of the slave simplifies code entry: just enter the level
    number (2 digits) and that's it.
	Do not edit the highscorefile, or the game wont work anymore.
    
Additional note: There is one defective charge of that rerelease. I managed
	to restore the defective data and included it (encrypted) in the
	imager. If you have that charge too (it crashes in level 7 or 8) you
	need to install your very original disk and not a backup, or the
	defective track (#5) cant be recognized and will not be restored.

The install is tested with 2 MB on an A1200, and on an 18 MB 68030.

Since my installs are freeware, and although i try to make them as reliable
as possible, you use them wholly on your own risk.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

Version 2.1 (21.03.2021) by JOTD
- reduced memory requirements to 512kb chip (issue #4764)
- trainer: infinite lives
- trainer: infinite money
- trainer: level select
- simplified level codes entry
- option to pre-set RAINBOW ARTS as player name so code
  entry is asked afterwards
- source code cleanup

Version 2.0 (24.02.2013) by Wepl
- new system friendly RawDIC imager
- extra imager included which is able to extract your highscores from
  disk, even from a cracked disk because scores are saved on cylinder
  80 in a non standard format in original and cracked releases;
  just run "rawdic RocknRoll_HS.ISlave" and copy the created file 'rrhigh'
  to the installed game data directory
- blitwaits in the intro added
- intro can be skipped via Custom1 tooltype
- highscores are divided by 10 to avoid overflow at 1000000 which is
  easiley reached in a normal play through (via jumping back you can
  get even higher scores, although I doubt that somebody will do because
  of the time needed to)
- leading zeros in the highscore table removed
- title scrolling fixed
- button control on map display fixed
- disk loader optimized to require less resload calls (2 disk version)
- source and docs included
- new icons

older versions done by Harry
- fixed stackframe error
- Several dbf-delays replaced.
- Crash after completion of the game (hopefully) fixed (Not tested 
  already, completing the game with the shortest way takes at
  least 2.5 h and 2 times testplaying is enough to me).
