   +-+  HINTS FOR RISE OF THE DRAGON +-+

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1 ... Your Apartment

Problem:
What do I do with my Vid-Phone?

Hint:
Check all of your messages on the Vid-Phone. This will allow you
to travel to many of the areas in the game. The first message is
from Mayor Vincenzi. After playing  back that message, a picture
will  scroll off  of the   printer. You  will need  this picture
later, so be sure to take it.

Problem:
What should I pick up in my apartment?

Hint:
Get your clothes, trenchcoat, bullet magazine, and gun, which is
under  the pillow,  and wire  tester from  the bedroom. From the
bathroom, you will need the NaPent and first aid kit.

Problem:
I'm locked out how can I get in?

Hint:
If  you leave  your keycard   in the  Vid-Phone, then  leave the
apartment, you will  be locked out. There is,  however, a way to
get in. You  can short out the door keypad  by opening the steam
pipe valve above the door.

Problem:
How do I get the keys for the cupboard?

Hint:
Make up  with Karyn in  order to get  the keys. Go  see Karyn at
city hall as soon as you leave your apartment. She will give you
the keys.

Problem:
How can I avoid being arrested when I leave my apartment.

Hint:
You  will be  arrested for  indecent exposure  if you leave your
apartment  without any  clothes on.  You will  need to  put your
clothes and trenchcoat on to avoid this.

   2 ... City Hall

Problem:
Karyn just yells at me! What should I do?

Hint:
Show Karyn  that you are sorry  for standing her up  last night.
You  should purchase  a dozen  roses from  the flower  vendor in
front  of city  hall. Use  your ID  card to  pay for  the roses.
Apologize to Karyn,  and give her the roses.  When she offers to
make a date  for tonight, take her up on  it! Later in the game,
you must  make a decision to  go and meet her  at 7:30, or stand
her up. If you stand her up, the game is over. If you have tried
to pick up on any other  girl or prostitute earlier in the game,
you  will be  unable to   continue. Karyn's  help is  crucial to
completion of the game.

Problem:
How do I deal with Jenni?

Hint:
Reject  all of  Jenni's advances  toward you.  If you  don't you
could lose Karyn, your key source of information. Jenni will let
you in to see  the mayor only if you have the  MTZ tape and yell
at her.

Problem:
How do I get in to see the Mayor?

Hint:
Yell at Jenni.  Tell her that it is very  important that you get
in  to  see  the  mayor.  You  can  only  do this after you have
obtained the MTZ tape from Karyn.

Problem:
What should I say to the Mayor?

Hint:
Threaten him, but  not to the point of  anger. Try the following
sequence: 3, 2, 2.

Problem:
How do I get into the Police Armory?

Hint:
Get the security pass from the  mayor. If you threaten the mayor
right up to  his limit, he will give in  and offer you the pass.
Show this  pass to deputy  Van Halen, and  he will clear  you to
enter. Once  in the armory, the  rifle is the only  item you can
get.

Problem:
I can't get into City Hall!

Hint:
City hall is only  open from 9 am to 5 pm.  If the icon will not
change, city hall is closed. Come back later.

Problem:
How do I avoid being thrown in jail?

Hint:
If you negotiate  with the Mayor too harshly,  he will throw you
in jail. When  you speak to him, try  the following sequence: 3,
2, 2.

   3 ... The Warehouse

Problem:
Where is the warehouse?

Hint:
On the screen where the flower vendor is, there is a small alley
to the  right side of the  screen. When you move  your icon over
this area of the screen, it  should change to an EXIT icon. This
alley is the way to the warehouse.

Problem:
How will the old man help me?

Hint:
The old  man will tell you  about the future, and  your purpose.
When he gives you time to speak, tell him you have something for
him to look at. Show him the scroll with the Chinese calligraphy
on it that  you found at Chen Lu's  apartment. He will translate
it for you, and tell you about the reservoir strike.

Problem:
How can I delay Deng Hwang's plans to take over LA?

Hint:
Blow up  his MTZ production  plant. Place a  bomb on the  second
power panel from the left, and  watch it blow up. This will blow
up  most of  the factory,  giving you  2 more  days to  stop him
completely.

Problem:
I'm having trouble putting on the bullet-proof vest.

Hint:
Remove  your  trenchcoat  first.  If  you  do  not  remove  your
trenchcoat first, you will not be able to wear the vest.

   4 ... The Pleasure Dome

Problem:
How do I get past the bouncers?

Hint:
Check all of your weapons with Martha, the person at the window.
You will not be able to pass unless you do.

Problem:
How do I keep from losing my weapon?

Hint:
When Slen asks if you have  anything else for them, give him the
candy bar.  After giving him the  candy bar, he will  give you a
claim check  for your weapon.  This is only  necessary the first
time you check in a weapon.

Problem:
Who can I speak to in here?

Hint:
You can speak to only 1 person in the card room, 1 person in the
room with  the dancer and stairs,  and 4 people in  the bar. The
people in the bar are the only ones that can help you.

Problem:
Where is "The Jake"?

Hint:
The Jake is the small guy in  the back of the bar wearing green.
You will want  to go easy on The Jake,  since he is your primary
source of hints and addresses.

Problem:
The Jake won't talk to me, or he says I need proof! What should I
do?

Hint:
The Jake needs proof that  Chandra Vincenzi was killed. Show him
the picture  from your Vid-Phone  that the mayor  sent you. This
will get his attention.

Problem:
How can I sit in on the card game with Darce?

Hint:
You won't be  able to play cards with Darce  or any of the other
players.  She is  merely being  polite by  telling you about the
game they are playing.

Problem:
How can I get The Jake to give me Chen Lu's address?

Hint:
When The Jake begins to talk, he will mention a character by the
name of Chen Lu. You have the  option here to ask about Chen Lu.
When you ask about Chen Lu, he  will say that he has never heard
of him. Ask him if he thinks Chandra would want him covering for
Chen Lu. The Jake will then give you the address.

Problem:
How can I win over The Jake?

Hint:
Give The Jake a candy bar after talking with him the first time.
This is crucial, or he will not warn you about the strikes later
in the game.

   5 ... Chen Lu's Apartment

Problem:
How can I get Chen Lu's to show up on the map?

Hint:
Talk  to The  Jake in  the Pleasure  Dome. If  you deal with him
correctly, he will give you  the address to Chen Lu's apartment.
Once he gives you the  address, the icon will automatically show
up on the map when you travel.

Problem:
How can I avoid being arrested in Chen Lu's?

Hint:
The police have  already started on their way  to the apartment.
You  will  need  to  get  in,  get  Chen  Lu's  ID card from his
Vid-Phone, and  come back later. If  you spend too much  time in
Chen Lu's apartment, the police will catch you there.

Problem:
What should I get from Chen Lu's?

Hint:
Get Chen  Lu's ID card,  the drug patch  from the bathroom  sink
counter, and the scroll from Chen Lu's safe in his bedroom.

Problem:
What should I do with the drug patch?

Hint:
Give the drug  patch to Karyn for her to  work on. She will have
it analyzed for you, and give you the MTZ tape which you can use
to bribe the mayor.

Problem:
What do I do with the Vid-Phone?

Hint:
Note Chen Lu's gun permit number  and ID number when you put his
ID card into  the Vid-Phone. You will be able  to look at one of
Chen Lu's previous messages.

Problem:
How can I find the safe?

Hint:
Look over the statue in Chen  Lu's bedroom. The right eyeball of
the  statue  will  sparkle  on  the  screen.  Click on the right
eyeball and the  statue will lower revealing a  save on the wall
behind it.

Problem:
How do I open the safe?

Hint:
You must have the gun permit number and ID number from Chen Lu's
Vid-Phone. Look  at the 4  numbers that are  common to the  two.
This is the combination to the safe.

Problem:
What do I do with the scroll?

Hint:
Give  the scroll  to the  old man  sitting on  the crate  in the
warehouse. He can translate it for you.

   6 ... Johnny Qwong's Residence
Problem:
How can I get Johnny Qwong's house to show up on the map?

Hint:
Show Chen  Lu's ID card  to Karyn at  City Hall. She  will run a
trace for you  and show that Johnny Qwong  is a known accomplice
of Chen Lu. After this, Johnny Qwong's house will show up on the
map.

Problem:
How do I get into Johnny Qwong's house? What do I do there?

Hint:
You  cannot enter  Johnny Qwong's  house. You  can, however, get
below his house. Try clicking on  the manhole cover in the lower
section of the screen.

Problem:
How do I open the Vid-Phone splicing trunk?

Hint:
Use a bomb to blow open the case. Drop a bomb on top of the lock
and stand back.

Problem:
How do I tap Johnny Qwong's Vid-Phone line?

Hint:
Use your wire tester. Attach the  red alligator clip to the left
battery terminal at the top of the screen. Next, attach the blue
clip to the grounding strap  wrapped around the conduit near the
bottom of the  screen. Lastly, take the yellow  clip and clip it
onto  the  second  terminal  up  from  the  bottom  of the lower
termination block.  This is a very  difficult sequence, and will
require much practice. Save your game often!

Problem:
I am continually being shocked to death at the terminal. Help!

Hint:
Hook up the  alligator clips to the terminals  correctly. If the
clip is  close to any  terminal other than  the one you  want to
drop it on,  you will be shocked. Be  extremely precise on where
you drop the clips on the screen.

Problem:
The sewer rats keep killing me!

We have no other problems for this category.

Hint:
The sewer rats are on a timer. If you hurry, you won't see them.
If you  spend a considerable amount  of time in the  sewer, they
will kill you.

   7 ... The Reservoir

Problem:
How do I get the reservoir to appear on the map?

Hint:
Show the old  man at the warehouse the  scroll that you obtained
from  Chen Lu's.  When he  translates it  for you  and tells you
about the strike at the reservoir, the reservoir will show up.

Problem:
What should I do at the reservoir?

Hint:
You will need  to ambush the strike unit  that will appear. When
they show up at the reservoir,  kill every one of them and steal
their hovercar.

Problem:
When will the strike units be in position?

Hint:
The strike units will show up  August 4th between 7:00 and 10:00
PM.

Problem:
I'm running out of time!

Hint:
If you  haven't blown up the  power panel next to  the warehouse
you will not have enough time.  Blowing up the power panel gives
you two additional days that you need.

Problem:
How can I defeat the guards at the reservoir?

Hint:
Be sure  to wear the  bullet proof vest.  Avoid getting shot  as
much as possible. You can be shot a few times if you are wearing
the bullet proof vest, but eventually  you will die. If you have
the rifle from the armory,  this will also increase your chances
of winning this sequence.

Problem:
How do I steal the hovercar?

Hint:
When you  move your icon over  the car near the  door, it should
turn into  an EXIT icon. Click  on that icon, and  you should be
able to enter the car.

Problem:
What should I do in the hovercar?

Hint:
Click on  the map in  the middle of  the car and  go directly to
Deng  Hwang's.  As  soon  as  you  wipe  out  the  guards at the
reservoir, you are on a timer, so hurry!

   8 ... Deng Hwang Enterprises

Problem:
How can I get Deng Hwang Enterprises to show up on the map?

Hint:
Once you  get the message from  Deng Hwang on your  Vid-Phone at
home, you will then be able to travel to Deng Hwang's factory.

Problem:
How do I get into Deng Hwang Enterprises?

Hint:
Drive the  hovercar to Deng  Hwang's. The hovercar  will land on
the roof,  bypassing the first  level of security.  You can also
show Snake's  ID card to the  guard at the gate  if you traveled
there by Emm-Way.

Problem:
How can I get past the receptionist?

Hint:
Lie to the her. Try telling  her that you remember her from high
school, and  that you would like  to go out with  her. Then tell
her that her  boss is in trouble, and you  are there to help. If
all else fails, use NaPent on her.

Problem:
I'm baffled by security room control panel!

Hint:
Manually override the security system. There are many ways to do
this. One way is to use  the color sequence found in the fortune
cookie. Press  button [I] (one)  then use the  sequence. You can
also find a  secret code in the game  documentation. If you find
this code,  you will be able  to use button [II]  (two), and the
correct sequence of colors.

Problem:
How do I figure out the manual overide code?

Hint:
Open  the fortune  cookie given  to you  by the  old man  on the
crate. Follow the letter abbreviations for the color codes.

Problem:
How do I prevent the guards from killing me?

Hint:
If you forgot to lock the guard  break room when you were at the
control panel, you will need to do  so. If you did and they find
you  anyway,  you  wasted  time  somewhere.  After you leave the
control  room,  complete  everything  as  quickly  as  possible.
Eventually, if you are not quick enough, they will find you.

Problem:
The  receptionist comes  to her  senses and  resets the  security
system. What should I do?

Hint:
Once she resets the security  system, do everything at lightning
speed. It is  only a matter of time before  the guards track you
down.

Problem:
What should I do in the Janitor's closet?

   H ... Hint display
Hint:
Get  some wire.  Open both  circuit breaker  boxes, turn off the
main on  top, then disassemble the  smaller gang switches below.
Use the screwdriver  on the sink in order to  do this. After the
switch panel has  been removed, grab a handful  of wires and put
it in your inventory.

Problem:
How can I save Karyn?

Hint:
Take the  wires you got from  the janitor's closet and  lay them
across  Karyn. Move  to the  close-up view  of Karyn, and unplug
each  of the  3 wires  connected  to  the neck  strap. Note  the
countdown  time on  the screen  behind her.  Save her before the
timer reaches 0!

Problem:
How can I get past the flame throwers?

Hint:
The flame  throwers work on  a pattern. Sit  and watch them  for
awhile. You will learn when it is safe to crawl under them after
learning the pattern.

Problem:
How can I kill Bahumat?

Hint:
If you are killed 5 times in a row, the game will ask you if you
want  to skip  the arcade  sequence. If  you choose  to skip it,
program  control will  take over  and show  you the ending story
panels of the game.
