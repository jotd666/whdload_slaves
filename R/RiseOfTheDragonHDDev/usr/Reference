INSTALLATION

Amiga Installation Procedure

The following are instructions for installing Rise of the Dragon onto a 
hard disk and booting the system.  Both can be done from either the 
Workbench or the CLI.  In the instructions we assume that you are using 
floppy drive DF0: and hard drive DH0:.  If your drives go by different 
names, replace the drive label in the example with the correct one.  For 
example, if you have an Amiga 3000, you will probably need to replace DH0: 
with WORK:.

Copying Rise of the Dragon to a Hard Disk

1. Boot your system

2. Insert Dragon Disk #1 into the first internal floppy disk
   drive.

3. From Workbench, double click on the Rise of the Dragon #1
   icon and then on the Install icon.

4. From the CLI, type CD DF0: and press the return key.
   Then type INSTALL and press the return key.  The Dynamix
   Install Utility window will appear.

5. Choose which drive and directory you wish to install the
   program to.  The default directory is: DH0:Dynamix/Dragon.
   To change the path, click in the Destination Directory box
   and type in the new path.

6. Click on the INSTALL button.

7. At the prompt, click on the OKAY button to install the 
   program files.  To cancel the installation process, click on

NOTES

Amiga Specific Notes

1. Rise of the Dragon does not multitask with other programs.
   For best performance, make sure no other programs are running
   when you start Dragon.

2. Although your system may have one megabyte of memory, you 
   still may not have enough available memory to run Rise of the
   Dragon.  Self-booting the program from disk should provide
   you with enough free memory to run the program.  NOTE: Memory
   allocated for hard disk partitions or resident programs will
   reduce the amount available for running programs.

3.  If your system has only the minimum RAM required to play
    (1MB), the Detail Level Slider is set to low and cannot be
    changed.

4. If you are playing off floppies, you can speed-up game play
   or disk loading by turning off the music or by inserting the
   music disk (#10) in a second drive.

5. If you are using more than one floppy drive, leaving the
   Music Disk (#10) in an external drive will reduce disk swaps.

TROUBLESHOOTING

Problem: Even though my computer has 1MB of memory, I receive a message 
saying there is not enough memory to run Dragon.

Possible Solution: Avoid running other programs before you start Dragon.  
Such programs might be using memory that Dragon needs.  It helps if you 
run Dragon from the CLI without loading the Workbench.  You can also save 
memory by running Dragon from the Workbench when there are no CLI or 
application windows currently open.

Problem: My computer doesn't have a hard disk, so I'm often forced to swap 
disks during game play.

Possible Solution: You can reduce the number of disk swaps by turning off 
the game's music or leaving the Music Disk (#10) in a second drive.  Press 
Alt-M to turn of the music.

Problem: Constantly playing music bugs me, but I still want to hear sound 
effects.

Possible Solution: Press Alt-M to turn off the music or select "music off" 
from the Options Menu.

Problem: Everytime I set the game's Detail Level to high, the computer 
lowers it.

Possible Solution: Unless your computer has more than 512K of chip RAM, 
you will be unable to set the game's Detail Level to high.  Owners of 
Amiga 1000s, or some older 500s and 2000s, will need to upgrade their 
computers to the 1MB Fat Agnus chip to increase the amount of chip RAM.
