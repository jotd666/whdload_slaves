 COMMENTS:

 Well, a very good game, but totally unusable with a 32 bit CPU such as a 68030, 68040 
 or 68060, even without 32 bit fastmem.
 A shame in 1994, the year this game was released.

 I tested the game intensively, so it should work OK.

 This game is really great in terms of graphics, speed, sound and playability. It really
 deserves this patch. I hope you'll enjoy it.

 LEVEL CODES:

 Enter any of the following for the password (thanks to K. Krellwitz for Sweetcheater)

                      "6581"____________________Level 2.
                      "3178"____________________Level 3.
                      "8392"____________________Level 4.
                      "7339"________For the game ending.
                      "6717"_____________Infinite lives.


 BUGS:

- A gameover could happen when you finish a level by killing the boss.
- Some small gfx corruption can occur on a game over (http://mantis.whdload.de/view.php?id=3870)
  This has been investigated but it's 1) random 2) very difficult to fix since there are a ton of blitter operations
  done at the same time.
