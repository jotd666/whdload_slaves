 This install applies to "Red Zone" © 1992 Psygnosis

 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

 version 3.1 (18.05.2022) done by JOTD:
 - fixed access fault when finishing a lap (hopefully)
 - crash on replay (because it was still missing relocs...)
 - added option for cheat keys (only for new exe)
 - caution: make sure you upgrate "fast_object" in the data directory,
   version provided in 3.0 still has bugs
 
 version 3.0 (13.05.2022) done by JOTD:
 - executable rebuilt/fixed for much better framerate on machines
   equipped with fast memory. Use CUSTOM2 to disable and play
   with original buggy & slow executable
 - CUSTOM4 bits skips/shortens introduction
 - set CUSTOM1 for no damage
 - option to enable high detail
 - chipmem reduced to 512kb
 
 version 2.0 (05.05.2005) done by JOTD:
 - rest of SMC fixed to work with instruction cache (better framerate)
 - RawDIC imager (use new RawDIC 4.0), direct wwp/ipf support

 - 2 access faults removed
 - Self-modifing code fixed

 - Convenient installer script
 - Quit with QUITKEY at anytime
 - Doc file included

 cheat keys:

 thanks:

 - Bored Seal for providing me WARPS of this game (through Angus, I believe)
 - Angus for extensive testing and support for everything 3D :)
 - All the WHDLoad team for interesting discussions and support
 - Bert for fixing the SMC detection in WHDLoad

 notes:

 - This game is lame, slow, jerky, detects 68020+ CPU but on the other hand uses
   a lot of self modifying code, and runs in chipmem only: worst configuration for
   a 3D game !!! Shame on the coders.
 - Needs RawDIC v4.0
 - Fortunately, after 17 years of stalled project & failures, I restarted
   working on relocating the executable to use fast memory and that time it worked,
   and improves the game greatly. Also most
   self-modifying code is fixed to be able to use caches properly on high-end
   machines. Source code of the new executable can be found at https://github.com/jotd666/FastRedZone
 - To upgrade from a previous installation, just copy "fast_object" to "data"
   directory. You can delete "object" too to save a few Kbs if you don't plan to
   play with the original executable.
 - There are still bugs, I believe they are original. The worst is the "ability"
   to get stuck in walls even with the direction keys.
