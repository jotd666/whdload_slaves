DEVON AIRE in the Hidden Diamond Caper (a/k/a Raffles)

You can't quite figure it. Everything about this job seems so simple -
and yet so strange. A few hours ago, Lady Crutchfield III begged you to
find her extensive collection of blue diamonds hidden in the mansion by
her rather eccentric late husband, Montague. The job sounded easy - look
around the house and as you find each gem, return it to Lady Crutchfield.

But the more time you spend in Crutchfield Manor, the tougher the job
gets! The floor plan defies explanation - when you cased the manor from the
outside you had no idea of its vast size. Lady C, never leaves her room -
she just rambles on about Montague's failed experiments in genetic
engineering on his pets. And for toppers, the front door's locked!

Even for you - master gem thief Devon Aire - this job's no picnic!

Manic Manor Manners

You start the game with three lives, tallied in the life counter at the
lower left of the screen. As you search the mansion you lose strength,
as shown by the strength bar above the life counter. Pick up full juice
goblets to regain strength. If the strength bar disappears, you lose a
life. If you lose all your lives before you find all the jewels, the game
ends.

Search in unlikely places by moving furniture. Stack objects to climb up
them and extend your reach. Map the manor (50 rooms in the Amiga version)
and list each room's contents. You can carry small objects from room to
room, one at a time.

When you find a gem (16 jewels in the Amiga version), pick it up and take it
to Lady Crutchfield. Drop the jewel in front of Lady C, and she will pick
it up. Objects you pick up appear at the lower right of the screen. You can
pick up only one object at a time; picking up a second object exchanges
the first object with the second object.

After you return all the jewels to Lady Crutchfield, you need to find your
way out of the manor! Keep searching - formerly inaccessible spots may now
yield their treasures.

Montague's Madness

Yikes! Stay away from Montague's failed experiments. They can be fatal!

Killer canaries Find a cagey way to fend off these pecking pests.

Mutant pig-mice Give them their favorite snack before they munch on you.

Poisonous plants Some plants are toxic, some are not. You'll have to find
out which is which.

One more odd thing; when the phone rings, it's for you! Find a phone and
pick it up while it's still ringing. As long as you're holding the phone
and you hear a dial tone, you're protected against the birds, pig-mice,
and plants.

Scoring

You get points for certain successful feats, such as drinking from goblets,
dousing the fire, and returning gems to Lady C. The point counter appears
above the strength bar.

Above all, stay cool. You can pull off this caper - it just may take some
time to figure out the eccentricities of Crutchfield Manor.
