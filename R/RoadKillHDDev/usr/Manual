HINTS & TIPS

A common mistake playing Roadkill is to ignore the Pitstops. If your armour is low, a quick pitstop will enable your
lightning fast crew of mech-droids to repair your machine. Risking death by racing with maximum damage is for the
mentally impaired.

Want to get rich? Driving with an agressive attitude is the only approach to earning big bucks. Break up with your
girlfriend, leave your wallet in the arcade then start a brawl at the pub. Overloading the adrenaline glands before
competing in Roadkill will help you earn jackpot after jackpot of filthy blood bucks.

Want to survive? Get out in front and stay there. Although opportunities for achieving maximum roadkills will be less
you are more likely to finish alive.

Want to die a violent and painful death? If yes then ....... Roadkill is your game.!!
