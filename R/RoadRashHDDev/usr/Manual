STAMINA METER

STAMINA IS A BRAINIC WORD FOR YOUR HEALTH

THE LINE ON THE STAMINA METER IS FULL AND GREEN WHEN YOUR FRESH AND
HEALTHY.IF YOU START TAKING POUNDINGS FROM OTHER RIDERS,THE LINE GETS
SHORTER.IF YOUR STAMINA GOES DOWN TO ZERO,WATCH OUT;ONE GOOD PUNCH OR KICK
AND YOUR OUT FOR THE COUNT.
BECAUSE OF YOUR BITCHIN LEATHERS AND EXPENSIVE SKID,YOUR STAMINA ISNT
AFFECTED BY WIPEOUTS,UNFORTUNATELY THE SAME CAN`T BE SAID ABOUT YOUR
BIKE.(SEE DAMAGE METER).

DAMAGE METER
------------
TELLS YOU WETHER YOU`VE TREATED YOUR BIKE LIKE THE PRISTINE MODEL OF
ENGINEEERING IT IS OR SHREDDED IT LIKE A PIECE OF CORRUGATED TIN BOG ROLL,
THE METER IS FULL WHEN YOUR BIKE IS IN GOOD CONDITION, WHEN THE BIKE TAKES
DAMAGE THE LINE GETS SHORTER. WHEN THE LINE DIAPPEARS, YOUR BIKE IS
TRASHED- YOUR WALKING TO THE FINISH LINE MATE...

TAP WILL DO..

SPEEDOMETER

EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT A SPEEDOMETER IS.OK,IF WE HAVE TO SAY IT; ITS THE
THING THAT MEASURES YOUR SPEED IN MILES PER HOUR.

SAME. CONTROL METHOD 1 IS THE DEFAULT MODE, BUT YOU CAN SWITCH BETWEEN THE
2 AT THE TRACK SELECTION SCREEN.

* PRESS F4 TO USE CONTROL METHOD 1
* PRESS F5 TO USE CONTROL METHOD 2

BRAWLING
--------
BRAWLING WITH THE OTHER RIDERS IS EASY - ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET WITHIN
STRIKING DISTANCE OF YOUR OPPONENT AND HIT THE RIGHT CONTROLS. YOU DONT
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AIMING - YOU AUTOMATICALLY WAIL ON THE NEAREST JERK TO
YOU.

SOME RIDERS CARRY CLUBS. YOU NEVER BEGIN A RACE WITH A CLUB,BUT YOU CAN
STEAL ONE FROM A RIDER WHO IS CARRYING ONE. TO GRAB A CLUB OUT OF AN
OPPONENTS HAND HAND, PULL UP BESIE HIM(OR HER IF ITS A CHICK) WHEN THEY
GOTO SWING AT YOU,PRESS THE `HIT` CONTROL (LIKE YOUR GONNA PUNCH THEM) THAT
USUALLY SPOOKS THEM LONG ENOUGH FOR YOU TO GRAB THE CLUB.

WIPE OUTS
---------
A WIPE OUT OCCURS WHEN YOU COLLIDE WITH SOMETHING (A POST, A TREE, AN
ANIMAL OR A CAR) OR WHEN A RIDER KNOCKS YOU FF YOUR BIKE. BAILING BOTH
DAMAGES YOUR MACHINE AND EATS AWAY YOUR TIME,SO DONT DO IT.KEEP IT IN MIND
THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR DAMAGES TO YOUR BIKE AFTER THE RACE.

AFTER YOU CRASH,YOU AUTOMATICALLY RUN BACK TO YOUR BIKE. IF YOU HAVE TO
CROSS THE ROAD TO GET YOUR BIKE.WATCH OUT FOR TRAFFIC. YOU CAN MOVE THE
JOYSTICK RIGHT AND LEFT TO AVOID TRAFFIC.

WINNING
-------
WHEN YOU WIN A RACE,YOU GET SOME CASH TO PUT TOWARDS A BETTER BIKE. THE
BETTER THE BIKE,THE MORE IT COSTS,SO START SQUIRRELING AWAY THE BUCKS.
