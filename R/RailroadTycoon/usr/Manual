PAGE 1

Contents

   Your Railroad Tycoon package should contain a manual, this technical
supplement folder, two Commodore Amiga disks, two player aid cards, and
a registration card.

Required Equipment

   Computer & Display:  This simulation requires a Commodore Amiga with
a minimum of 1 Meg. of RAM and a color monitor.  Please pre-format a
disk for your Saved Games.

   Controls:  The simulation can be run entirely from the keyboard, or 
with a mouse and keyboard.  A mouse is recommended as the interface
has been designed to take advantage of the mouse.  Unlike some
MicroProse simulations, a joystick cannot be used to run Railroad
Tycoon.

Installation on a Hard Disk

   COMMODORE AMIGA: Boot up your hard disk as normal and insert Railroad
Tycoon Disk A.  Open this disk and double-click on the "INSTALL" icon.  
Please follow any on-screen prompts.  A folder titled "Railroad" will be
created on your hard disk, containing all necessary files.

LOADING

Loading from Floppy Disks

   COMMODORE AMIGA:  If your computer has KickStart in ROM, insert the
Railroad Tycoon "A" disk into the internal drive.  The program will
then auto-load.

   If your computer does not have KickStart in ROM, load KickStart
as normal, then insert your Railroad Tycoon Disk A into the internal
drive.  The program will then auto-load.

   Thereafter during play you are prompted when you must remove the
"A" disk to insert the "B" disk.  Note that at certain times the
program accesses the "A" disk for information so do not remove the
"A" disk from your drive once the game has begun unless prompted to
make a switch.

Loading from a Hard Disk

   COMMODORE AMIGA:  Boot up your hard disk as normal.  Open the 
"Railroad" drawer and double-click on the "Game" icon.

SAVED GAMES

  You may save games currently under way and recontinue them at a 
later date.  Games may be saved onto your hard drive or onto a 
previously saved game disk.  You may not save games onto your 
original game disks or back-up game disks.  To save a current game,
open the Game menu and choose "Save Game".  If the game was booted
from floppy disk, you will be asked to insert your previously
formatted Save Game disk before selecting a slot to save to.

   You may only have four games saved on any disk.  If the game
files are full on any disk, move the highlight to the existing
saved game you wish to overwrite and press return.  This writes
the new saved game over the old one, erasing the old one.  If you
don't want to erase any game on a full disk, hit the ESC key to
return to the game, and start over.  However, you cannot format a
disk while the game is underway, so have additional formatted disks
handy.

       game you wish to load is highlighted, and press RETURN.
       This loads the saved game.

AMIGA RAILROAD TYCOON FEATURES

   Dissolving Railroads:  If the shore price of a competing railroad
falls below $5 and stays there for too long, there is a chance that
the railroad can be dissolved and disappear entirely from the game.

   Bankruptcy Penalty:  For each bankruptcy that you declare, the 
interest you must pay for selling new bonds is increases by 1%.
After enough bankruptcies, you will be unable to sell any bonds.

   Car Costs:  Each car you place on your trains costs $5,000.
When you make consist changes, you are only charged if the total
number of cars on your railroad increases.

   Menu Options:  You may highlight any menu option by pressing the
letter key of the first letter in the option.  If more than once 
choice share the same first letter, additional letter key taps
cycle through the options that start with the same letter.

   Sound Effects:  If you selected one of the sound driver options
when you started your game, you may toggle the sound effects on or
off later in the game.  This is done from the Features option, 
found in the Game menu.  If you selected No Sounds when beginning
play, the sound effects option does not operate.

   Find City:  You may zoom into the Detail Display around any city
in the game world by pulling down the Display menu and choosing 
"Find City."  Type in at least enough letters of the city name to
distinguish it from all other cities in the world and press RETURN.

   Animations:  There are no animated sequences in the Amiga version,
speeding up game play.  Hence there is no Animation option in the
Game Menu.

   Difficulty Levels:  You are not required to retire after a certain
number of years as explained in the manual on page 16 under Difficulty
Levels.  Instead, you may play up to 100 years at any level.  However,
you may not increase the level of difficulty once you have started
playing.  The difficulty level you choose when beginning a new game
remains in effect for its duration.

WORLD ECONOMY NOTES

North America

   North America is blessed with huge natural resources that have only
been exploited since the beginning of European colonization.  To this
day, the region remains a major source of raw materials such as coal,
metallic ores, oil, and wood products.  It is also one of the richest
meat and grain producing regions in the world.

   Railroads were especially useful in America because they made
cheap transportation available throughout this large continent.  They
made exploitation of this bounty of resources possible.

   The early railroads were built to bring mainly raw products, such
as coal and grain, from the continental interior to the peripheral
harbors.  As the region industrialized, the role of railroads
expanded.  They moved people westward during the great expansion,
they interconnected the growing eastern cities, and they connected the 
growing industrial sector with both the sources of raw materials and
markets.

In Railroad Tycoon the economic impact and role of railroads in 
North America is similar to that of the real world.  The equivalent
of the Pittsburgh steel mills, the West Virginia coal fields, the
Detroit automobile factories, and the Chicago stockyards are in the
game, though rarely in their historical location.  The opportunity is
their for your railroad to find the raw materials and connect them to
the industries, and the industries to their markets.  You develop
your business by linking the coal fields to the steel mills, the
steel mills to the factories, and the factories to the cities.

   In a similar manner you can connect the cattle ranches to
stockyards, the grain elevators to food processing plants, lumber
yards to paper mills, etc.  When you connect larger cities together,
you create the opportunity for carrying mail and passengers between
them.  Harbors and river landings are places where you can pass on
cargos to ships and river boats, and may be a source of new cargos
from overseas.

   As you build and operate your railroad, you witness the impact 
you have on the population and industrial growth of the area that
you serve.  Cities along your railroad may become the Pittsburgh
or Detroit of your world.

England

   Great Britain was the first nation to industrialize and the place
where the concept and technology of railroading was invented.  The
earliest railroads in Britain were built to connect interior 
industries and resources with harbors.  The main export resource
was coal, mostly shipped around the coast to London and other
population centers.  But unlike North America where there was a rich
variety and quantity of resources, in Britain the resources were more
limited.

   As a result of the Industrial Revolution, this island nation was
converted into an industrial powerhouse, a world leader in 
manufacturing technology and production.  Raw materials not available
at home were imported and converted into good for export or home
consumption.  Railroads played a vital role in this industrialization
by easing and speeding the movement of materials, finished goods, 
and labor throughout the country.

   For example, coal from the mines near Newcastle was first carried
by rail to coastal ports like Sunderland, and later directly by rail
to the steel mills and factories of Sheffield.

PAGE 4


PAGE 5

The famous Sheffield knives went by train throughout the country and
from ports throughout the world.

   Another major industry comprised the cotton mills that grew around
Manchester to use the water coming down the hills for power.  Cotton
for the mills arrived at Liverpool from India and the American South,
and was carried by rail to Manchester.  The mills converted the 
cotton to cloth goods that were carried back to Liverpool for
shipment overseas.

   In Railroad Tycoon you can profit by looking for these same
economic relationships.  Harbors are sources of supply for cotton
and hops, and these cargos can be carried to textile mills and
breweries for conversion into goods and beer.  Pottery and glass
goods from glass works, the products of chemical plants, and factory
goods can all be shipped to harbors for exportation.

   To be successful, your railroad must link the peripheral harbors
to the industrial midlands and resource centers.  Since each game
map is different, you must locate coal and chemical deposits now 
not necessarily outside Newcastle, and link these resources to the
industries that use them.  In this way you can help build cities
such as Salisbury or York into another London.

Europe

   The European economy is in the middle, between the resource rich
North American economy and the industry rich British economy.  Europe
is large enough to have substantial resources and thus not depend so
much on imported resources.  Still, the European nations 
industrialized, although after Britain and not to the same degree.

   Blessed with greater natural resources than the island nation of
Great Britain, the European nations were not as forced to rely on
their ability to manufacture goods for exportation.  Although trade
was certainly important, it was not necessary to finance the 
importation of food and materials as it was in Britain.  Most of the
larger European nations found within their borders sufficient natural
resources for industrial production.

   Nevertheless, some nations proved to have a comparative advantage in
the production of certain goods.  These advantages became the basis
for international trade across the continent.  French wines were traded 
for German guns or Italian cloth.

   Railroads served their familiar important transport role throughout
Europe.  Within nations they brought the coal and ore to the mills,
and moved the mill products to other industries and harbors.  They
were also found to be more important people movers than in either
Britain or North America because of congestion, lack of roads, and
high petroleum costs.  Between nations railroads hauled resources,
finished products, people, and mail.
 
   In Railroad Tycoon the rich industrial region of the Ruhr River
Valley or the grain fields of the Ukraine may turn up anywhere.
As a railroad president it is for you to search the map to find
the pieces of the economic puzzle and profitably link them together.

WORLD CITY LISTS

   The following lists include all the cities found on the four world
maps.  To find the location of any city pull down the Display menu
and choose "Find City."  Type in enough letters of the city name to
differentiate it from any other name on the list.  For example, in the
Northeast USA, "All" is enough identification for Allentown because
those letters differentiate it from all other cities on the list,
including Albany and Altoona.

   The same information is sufficient when ordering a controlled railroad
to build track from one city to another.
