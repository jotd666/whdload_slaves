 This install applies to "RoadKill" AGA/CD남  1993/1994 Vision

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 2.0 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.2-B (12.07.2020) done by JOTD:
 - fixed long-time sound bug in AGA version(issue #0003441).
   Reinstall the game or apply "patch_snd" file only sound file like this:
   patch_snd sounds.blkpak (thanks for EAB members for the solution)
 
 version 2.2 (11.08.2019):
 - changed joypad read routine. Blue button fires the missiles
   (it was using green button despite the manual says), leading to
   keyboard and joypad/2-button joystick unified controls
   (P / Play for pause, up/down fwd/rev for gear switch)
 - fixed controls to "CD32" (works for joysticks too),
   fixes issues #000004092 and #0002074 which look like an original game bug
 - megatrainer added (invincibility, infinite retries, infinite missiles)
 - misc menu controls defaults directly modifiable from splash screen
 
 version 2.1-B (22.05.05) done by JOTD:
 - fixed a bug in v2.1 slave (AGA/CD남) so it works without the
   big intro animation file (sorry about that, even AGA version couldn't work)

 version 2.1 (11.05.05) done by JOTD:
 - added manual (typed by Stellan, thanks dude)
 - CD남 intro animation supported if file "RoadkillIntro.anim7" is manually
   copied from the CD to the "data" directory (it is skipped by default). Install
   script now allows to copy it too.

 version 2.0 (07.05.05) done by JOTD:
 - complete rewrite of install & slave using KickEmu (A1200/A4000 ROM image needed)
 - CD남 support supported as well
 - joystick/joypad routine & 2-button routine fixed
 - hiscore saving/loading from HD
 - source code included

 version 1.0 (19.10.01) done by JOTD:
 - initial release (floppy version only)

 Notes: 
 
 - Due to the large size of the intro animation in the CD남 version (23 megs),
   I did not include it in the WHDLoad install (file "RoadKillIntro.anim7").
   You can still view it from the CD-ROM using multiview or any other
   IFF-ANIM capable browser.

 Level codes:

                  TRACKLEVEL 0 =  LQPONTQNJO / LQPONSSFRP

                        TRACKLEVEL 1 =  LQPONRHCNM 

                        TRACKLEVEL 2 =  LQPONUPQCK 

                        TRACKLEVEL 3 =  LQPONTMBCH

                        TRACKLEVEL 4 =  HQPOPONLRK

                        TRACKLEVEL 5 =  PQPOQTETNT

reported bugs (not reproduced):

- crashes when using CD32 controls: should be fixed with new CD32 controls
- engine noise corrupted with accelerator boards: issue #0003441 still to fix
