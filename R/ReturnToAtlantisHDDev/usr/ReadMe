 This install applies to "Return To Atlantis" © 1988 Electronic Arts

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 1.0 (06.12.08) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - disk protection neatly removed
 - documentation included
 - source code included

 Notes:

 The Lockpick crack was not usable on a HD version because it required a disk
 in the drive and a slow CPU speed. I removed completely the call to the diskcheck.
 I hope there's no sneaky check about that.

 The protection was funny. First it required you to reboot, after having set a value
 in a zero-page area. Meant or not, the game did not start when Action Replay was
 running because AR clears memory on startup! If the value is not set to "EAEA", then
 the main program quits

 The disk protection was funny too: the code is located in 4 separate data files, 
 also containing actual game data, and one is loaded, but at random, so you can
 never know where the routine will be located. Once I found out that trick, it was
 easy to 1) fix the random thing, and 2) remove the call to the diskcheck.

 There was also a buggy floppy/hd check which failed in the WHDLoad environment. Well,
 no wonder why this game was never WHDLoad installed until now. It was full of little
 traps, willingly or not, and it took me several hours to pick all that apart to create
 a working install.

 Note that this version is beta: only tested in WinUAE, and since I don't know the
 game well, I did not go very far. I count on you to report bugs/crashes :)
