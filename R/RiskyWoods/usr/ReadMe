 This install applies to "Risky Woods" © 1992 Dinamic.

 Requirements:
 -------------
 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path.
 These programs can be found in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed game requires 0.5 MB ChipMem (+1.2 MB OtherMem for preload).

 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").


 Features:
 ---------
 - Full load from HD (real files!)
 - Protection removed (manual check)
 - Interrupts fixed
 - DMA wait in replayer and sample player fixed (x4)
 - Memory check disabled
 - Blitter waits added (x8, 68010+ only)

 - Quit option that works on 68000 machines (default key is 'F10')
 - CD32 joypad controls

 Another old patch which has now been redone. There were a few
 bug reports for the old patch, I checked the game, noticed that
 there are files tables on both disks, coded a RawDIC imager and
 made a new patch from scratch. Game code is fine except for
 a lot of buggy CIA waits which for example could cause sound problems,
 these should now all be fixed.

 I have added quite a few trainer options which can be selected in
 WHDLoad's splash window. If in-game keys are enabled the following
 extra keys can be used:

 E: refresh energy
 A: add money
 H: refresh time
 T: toggle unlimited time
 F: get fire ball for 10 seconds
 I: invincibility for 10 seconds
 N: skip level
 
 Please note that high-score saving is disabled if any
 trainer options are used.


 Enjoy the game from HD.
