THE RUBICON STORY...

IN MAY 2011 AN ACCIDENT IN A SOVIET NUCLEAR POWERPLANT SITUATED ON KOALA
ISLAND CAUSED A MAJOR DISASTER. RADIOACTIVITY WAS SPREAD OVER AN AREA OF
300 SQUARE MILES WITH A RADIATION VALUE OF 1230000 RAD.
THE SOVIET UNION AND FINALND WERE EVACUATED IMMEDIATELY. MONTHS LATER
TERRIFYING MUATATIONS IN THE AREA WERE DISCOVERED WHERE RADIATION HAD
SPREAD.

THE ONLY SURVIVOR TELLS US; `THESE CREATURES WERE BEYOND RECOGNITION, BUT
SEEMED TO POSSESS THE INTELLIGENCE OF MANKIND`. IT IS YOUR MISSION TO
DISARM THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BEFORE ONE OF THE MUTATIONS STARTS USING
THEM.GOOD LUCK...WE PLACE OUR TRUST IN YOU.
