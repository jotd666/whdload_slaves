POLICE QUEST 2

GENERAL QUESTIONS

All I do is wander about! Is this it?
        Search the police station to find the tools of your trade. 
        You will need them when you are in the field.  Read the 
        documentation that came with the game.

What's the point of this game, anyway?
        Find escaped felon Jessie Bains, the "Death Angel." Discover 
        evidence, follow leads, and build your case.  Finally, come 
        face-to-face with the Death Angel and take the appropriate 
        action.

I'm tired of dying and started over again from the beginning!
        Everyone fails a lot in adventure games.  That's one reason 
        it's so satisfying when you finally solve one.  You need to 
        read your game documentation.  Adventure games are designed 
        to be saved periodically so you don't have to start at the 
        beginning every time you make a mistake.

Sonny walks too slow! Sonny walks too fast!
        Refer to the game menu.  Scenes with lots of animation, may 
        appear to run at "normal" speed even though in "fast" mode.

How can I "look at" the objects I have?
        Type "look gun" to see your gun.  Read your game 
        documentation included in your game.

AT THE STATION

I can't find the key to get into the station.
        It can be found on a ring.  Think of a logical location for 
        a key.  Look in your car.  Look at the dash.

I can't find the passwords for the computer.
        They are located in the homicide office.  Try looking on the 
        desk.  Look at the papers on the Captain's desk.

I can't find the keys to the unmarked car.
        They're in one of the offices.  Hanging on a keyboard.  Try 
        the Homicide office.

How do I find the combination to my locker?
        It can be found in a very logical place.  The glove box of 
        your personal car.  On a business card.  Turn the card over.

Where in the world do I find the field kit?
        It's found in the police station.  Make sure you search each 
        scene thoroughly.  It's located in the hallway.  You need to 
        face the front of the counter, on the right side of screen.

I'm not successful adjusting my gun sights.  What am I doing wrong?
        Aim at the same location on the target each time you fire.  
        To develop a pattern, fire at least twice each time.  Bring 
        the target forward for viewing.  "Look target."  "Adjust 
        sights" accordingly.  Repeat the above steps 
        until...........  The message reads, "your sights are 
        correctly adjusted."

What do I do with Lloyd Pratt?
        Talk to him.  Save his job.  You first have to use the 
        computer in the office.  Look in the "personnel" directory.  
        Then go back to Lloyd and type "Help man."

The Captain calls me in and reprimands me, why?
        Captain Hall enjoys his work.  He likes picking on you.  You 
        took too long starting your investigations.

What is operation code name "Ice man?"
        A new Sierra adventure game in the works.  Author and 
        designer, Jim Walls.  A military, covert operation.  
        Features a nuclear attack submarine.  Watch for it in late 
        summer 1989.

Where do I find Marie's phone number?
        Your desk holds the answer.  LT&T is at your service.  Dial 
        information.  Dial "411"  Ask for "Marie Wilkans."

Where do I find Colby's phone number?
        At the motel.  It's found in room 108.  In the bathroom.  In 
        the sink.

DRIVING

At the start of the game I can drive my personal car around 
but nothing happens.
        You're supposed to be going to work not getting off.  Don't 
        drive your personal car in the beginning.

How do I get anywhere in the car?
        Very carefully.  With your eyes wide open.  For example 
        type,"drive to jail."

How do I make Keith stop his smoking?
        Ask him.  Didn't do you a bit of good did it?  Maybe the 
        Schick treatment.

AT THE JAIL

How can I get inside of the jail?
        There is a procedure to follow.  Ring the buzzer.  Show your 
        identification.

What do I do once I'm inside?
        Talk to those who can help you.  Talk to jailer.  Talk to 
        witness.  You need to look at two files.  Look at Bains' 
        file and take new mug shot.  Look at Pate's file and note 
        his gun's serial number.

AT THE MALL

I'm stumped at the mall.
        Have you investigated everything thoroughly?  You will need 
        your "field kit."  Investigate the jailer's car.  Dust the 
        glove box.  Type "use the tape."  Open glove box and take 
        holster and bullets.

What is the sale item I need from the mall?
        You've wasting time on this one.  You're still wasting time.  
        Nothing at this mall is on sale.  You can't even get inside.

COTTON COVE

I keep dying from the ambush.
        Bains isn't there to play tag.  Did you read the message 
        that followed your demise?  Your gun sights must be properly 
        adjusted.  Just after Bains enters scene fire your gun, you 
        will miss.

I keep getting run down by Bains
        That's his sole purpose in life.  You can avoid being run 
        down if..........  You walk up toward the river.

After the ambush, is that all there is?
        Did you talk to the jogger?  Search each scene.  Evidence 
        can be found in the far left scene.  It's found by the 
        water's edge all the way to the left.  "Look down."

What's the deal with the trash can?
        Nothing unless the ambush has taken place.  Evidence can be 
        found inside the can.  "Search garbage."  Get clothes and 
        read tag.

I can't help search the river because I don't have a dive 
card...........Where do I find it?
        If you took everything from your desk drawer, you have it.  
        It's in your wallet.  "Search wallet."

Is there really a body to be found?
        Yes.  It's wedged between the rocks.  It's in the scene all 
        the way to the right.  At the right side of screen in the 
        middle "look down."  You must "move rock" which exposes a 
        hand.  "Look at the hand."  Type "remove the body."

Is there other evidence to be found in the river?
        Yes, before you remove body.  Swim to the scene all the way 
        to the left.  Located near the middle of the scene you can 
        find the makeshift knife used in the escape.  Type "look 
        down."  In the middle scene, in the center of the scene, 
        type "look down," and you will find the jailer's badge.

After changing into the "Bag Lady," how do I change back to 
Sonny Bonds?
        This is really off the wall.  If you change into the "Bag 
        Lady" we have a serious problem.  Please contact our 
        "customer service" and report it.

Where in the world do I go when I finish Cotton Cove?
        You can find a clue from the radio broadcast.  Recall the 
        last known direction of the fleeing vehicle.  "Drive to the 
        airport."
	
AIRPORT

Is there anything to find in the stolen car?
        Yes, a fingerprint.  Think of a logical place it can be 
        found.  One of the first things a thief would do after 
        stealing a car.  He might adjust the rear view mirror.  
        "Dust rear view mirror."  Type "use tape."

How do I get into the stolen car?
        You must have probable cause.  Look the car over carefully.  
        Stand at the front of the car.  Look at the license plate.

What do I do in the airport?
        Much information can be found here.  Try talking to the 
        ticket agents and car rental agents.  Remember the 
        procedure.  Identify yourself.  Show Bains' mug shot.  Look 
        at the lists the agents will give you.

I bought flowers, now what do I do with them?
        Nothing right away.  Be patient.  You can give them to a 
        nice young lady.  Give them to Marie when you have dinner.

Is there anything tangible I can find?
        Evidence.  Found in a room of rest.  Look around in the bathroom.
        Try different things.  Flush the toilet.  Remove the tank lid in
        the middle stall.  Remove the gun. Use the hand dryer on the gun.

Where do I go when I finish the airport?
        When the trail gets cold, head for the barn.  Drive back to the
        station & finish your work.  Take care of the evidence you've
        gathered.  "Book evidence" at the booking window.

How do I get authorization to purchase a ticket?
        You need enough evidence to convince the Captain.  You need
        Colby's business card.  You need the hit list.  Call Steelton
        Police Dept.  Call and warn Colby.  You need to show the evidence
        to the Captain.

ARNIE'S RESTAURANT

I'm at the restaurant with Marie, what do I do?
        You mean you can't think of anything?  Try talking to her.  Buy
        her something to eat.  Try kissing her.  Give her the flowers.
        Kiss her more than once.

ROBERTS MURDER SCENE

Did I miss anything significant at the murder scene?
        Before you remove the body did you find the corner of envelope?
        After getting the corner of envelope tell Coroner to remove body.
        Did you find the "death threat note" in the trunk?

I drive to the murder scene but nothing is there.
        Nothing will be at the murder scene if...........  You go there
        before day two or...........  If you take too long getting there.

What do I do or where do I go after the scene?
        Did you find the address to the Snuggler's Inn?  It's in the
        trunk.  Clutched in the victim's hand.  "Drive to address on the
        corner of envelope."

MOTEL

The motel manager won't tell me anything.
        Does he know who you are?  You have to identify.  Did you show him
        Bains' mug shot?

What can I find inside the motel room.
        You really don't want to know everything do you?  Try searching a
        little harder.  You can find blood, envelope and letter, lipstick
        and business card.  The lipstick is under the bed on the far side.
        The letter is in the nightstand next to bed.  The business card is
        in the sink in the bathroom.

Where do I go when I'm finished with the motel?
        Do you remember any of Marie's conversation?  Did you remember the
        color of Marie's lipstick?  She said she was worried about the
        escape.  You had better check on her.  Drive to Marie's.

MARIE'S HOUSE

Marie's house is a mess but that's about it.
        Are you sure you have looked everywhere?  Have you found the "hit
        list?"  It's on the floor.  Near the ashtray.

What do I do with the souffle in Marie's oven?
        If it's hot, eat it.  Give it to Keith.  There's no souffle in
        Marie's oven.

What do I do after finishing Marie's house?
        After any good investigation it is a good idea to use radio.  Head
        for the barn.  Book any evidence you have.  Check with the
        Captain.

AIRPLANE

I keep getting thrown off the plane.
        Listen to the stewardess.  Follow instructions.  Make sure you
        fasten your seat belt.

I can't get by the hijacker, he keeps killing me.
        You need to act fast.  You have to use your gun.  Act when the
        stewardess fall to the floor.

The hijacker still keeps killing me!
        What happened at the motel is affecting you here.  When the
        shotgun discharged, Sonny spun around hitting his gun hand.  You
        should have adjusted your gun sights before leaving station.

I'm sorry but the hijacker STILL keeps killing me.
        Have you been enjoying the refreshments?  Drinking alcoholic
        beverages and shooting just don't mix.  

I can't find the bomb.
        It's located in the rear of the plane.  Somewhere in the restroom.
        You mean you still haven't found it?  Try the paper towel
        dispenser.

Defusing the bomb is something else!! How do I do it?
        The answer is the plane.  The dead hijackers have the answer.  Try
        searching them.  On one of them, you need to search the turban.

I'm still having problems defusing the bomb!
        You will need wire cutters.  You need the bomb instructions.
        Study the instructions carefully.  Perform each step of the
        instructions in reverse.

STEELTON PARK

What do I do with that confounded dog?
        He has purpose.  In this life but...........  Not in this game!

I can't seem to get by the mugger!
        Did you look around the Lieutenant's office at Steelton PD?  You
        can get rid of the mugger one of two ways.  You can use the hand 
        held radio or...........  Draw your weapon on him.

How can I make friends with the mugger?
        Call him "sir."  It didn't work, did it?  You can't.  His sole
        purpose is to mug you.

I just keep wandering, is there anything here to find?
        Yes.  Try a little harder.  It's near the right side of a little
        hill.  Type "look down," you will discover the sewer entrance.

SEWER

I can't get past the methane gas.
        You're going the wrong direction.  You need a gas mask.  After
        entering the sewer, walk to the right and stay on the lower side.
        Continue into the next scene on your right and ignore all messages
        about the gas.  Make a right turn and walk downthe screen staying
        on the left side.  Continue walking down the screen into the next
        scene.  Walk into the scene on the left and find the gas mask.

After I release Marie, Bains immediately enters the room and shoots me.
        Bains was alerted by the noise.  In her excitement Marie became
        too loud.  Before untying Marie, you must tell her to "keep
        quiet."

I just can't figure out how to get Bains.
        Listen to Marie.  You need to hide.  Hide behind the large pipe on
        the left.

I still can't get Bains!
        Make sure your gun is loaded.  Make sure your gun is drawn.  Make
        sure you are facing toward the center of the room.  Do all the
        above before Bains enters the room.
