 This install applies to "Pinball Mania" © 1995 21st Century Entertainment.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.5 MB ChipMem and 1.3 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200", or kick40068.A4000. 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" or  "kick40068.A4000.RTB" must
 be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

CD³² joypad controls: 

Red           - start game                (F1)
Down		  - launch ball               (return)
Rev/Forward   - left/right flippers       (left/right shift)
Up            - nudge table upwards       (space bar)
Play		  - pause game                (p)
Green         - quit                      (ESC)
Yellow        - confirm quit              (Y)
Blue          - right flipper
Left          - left flipper

menu options:
- red: Tarantula
- blue: Jail Break
- yellow: Kick-off
- green: Jackpot

If CUSTOM2 is set the controls try to use only standard joystick (port 1) inputs so:

Red           - start game / add a player (numerical enter)
Down		  - launch ball               (return)
Up            - nudge table upwards       (space bar)
Right         - right flipper
Left          - left flipper

control keys are achieved through joystick (port 0)

Joy2 button 1  - escape
Joy2 left      - Y
Joy2 right     - N

menu options:
- left: F1/Tarantula
- right: F2/Jail Break
- down: F3/Kick-off
- up: F4/Jackpot
- reverse: F5/options
- forward: F6/configure keys (do not do that with joypad controls!)
- play: esc

Of course, that setting isn't practical with a joystick because you cannot use left+right at the same time, but
the person who asked for this feature wants to create an arcade cabinet so it's not a problem activating left+right

to enter hiscore, you need keyboard. If you don't have a keyboard, you can
still skip this part by entering "Y" (yellow), "P" (play) or "space" (up). It won't
be your initials, okay, just change your name to Yander Price and it will be fine.

(with CUSTOM2 set, use the joystick in port 0 left/right to enter Y or N)

Finally after almost 20 years this game uses fast memory. This was extremely easy to fix
because pinball code is well-written, only the overlay loader is broken and forces chip
memory even on program code.

The new release of the slave allows game to run properly on accelerator boards.
