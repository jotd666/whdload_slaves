  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  POWER PINBALL'S KEYBOARD COMMANDS: Keyboard commands are available
  for EVERY pull down menu in POWER PINBALL.  Each menu keyboard equiv-
  alent is noted in preceding pages of this manual in the "Menu Tour."

  During PLAY mode the following keys are active:

  RETURN: 
  -Drops another coin into the coin slot.

  SPACE:
  -Starts another game.  Press [space] up to four times to play multi-
  player games.

  B or b: 
  -Toggles the background noise on and off.

  AMIGA KEYS:
  -(or Commodore key on the left and Amiga key on the right, on some 
  Amiga keyboards) function as pinball machine flippers.

  ALT KEYS:
  -Shake the machine.  Be careful not to tilt it!
 
  ARROW KEYS:
  -The up and down arrow keys control the spring tension against the
  pinball when it is in its chute and ready to launch.  The Arrow Keys
  are also referred to as "Cursor Keys" and their arrangement and place-
  ment varies slightly on different model Amigas' keyboards.

  RIGHT AMIGA KEY
  -Shoots the ball out of its tube when the spring is pulled back.


  DIRECTORIES ON THE POWER PINBALL DISK:
  
  There are 5 directories which must reside on the same disk where Pinball
  is placed.  These are:

  MACHINES
  -Where the machines are kept.  These files contain the bumper, walls,
   point values, programmed events, and etc.  Each saved pinball machine
   contains internal information to point it to the other files in the 
   other directories which it needs to play correctly.  No special suffix
   is required in pinball machines' names.

  PICS
  -The IFF background/playfield picture files are stored here.  All file
  names in this directory must end with ".pic".

  SOUNDS
  -Sound files are stored here.  No special suffix is required in pinball
  machines' sound file names.  Sound files should not exceed a maximum of
  128K bytes of data.  You may create your own sound files with sound digi-
  tizing hardware and software available from other manufacturers.  POWER
  PINBALL has no facilities for editing sound files.

  HISCORES
  -High score files for each machine are kept here.  POWER PINBALL auto-
  matically writes these files when required (providing the disk is not
  write-protected) and each is named with the suffix of ".HiScore" You
  should not attempt to modify these files in any way.  They are completely
  under game control.

  MISC
  -This directory contains Flippers.pic and icon information.  The files
  which are stored in the MISC directory are ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to the 
  proper functioning of POWER PINBALL.  Please do not delete ANY files from
  the MISC directory nor attempt to alter or modify any of them in any way,
  ever.  No icons exist in this drawer but it is not empty.

  The preceding has been typed by Capricorn/Fusion on 09-19-90.  The complete
  DOX on how to make MACHINES etc. should hopefully be typed up soon to 
  follow.  Greets to all I know and especially to Paradox for cracking the
  game!!!
