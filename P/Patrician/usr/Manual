THE MEDAEVAL GERMANY DURING THE TIME OF THE POWERFUL TRADING ORGANISATION
KNOWN AS THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE. THE PLAYER CAN CHOOSE ONE OF EIGHT HANSEATIC
TOWNS TO BE HIS/HER HOME BASE AND AS A SHIP OWNER, SEND OUT HIS FLEET TO
SIXTEEN TOWNS TRADING IN EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF GOODS. BY CLEVER
ACTIONS YOU CAN GAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL TOWNS PEOPLE AND BE ELECTED

FOR ALDERMAN OR PATRICIAN... IF YOU SUCCEED YOU HAVE WON THE GAME !

WHEN YOU PLAY THE PATRICIAN YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE PRICE OF GOODS IS NOT
FIXED AND IS INDEED DEPENDENT ON THE WAY THE GAME IS PLAYED. THE PRICE AND

SUCCESS OF THE TOWN AND IN DOING SO ENHANCE YOUR OWN STANDING AND " RUN "
FOR MAYOR ! NO TWO GAMES ARE THE SAME BECAUSE OF THESE FACTORS ! WATCH THAT
YOU DONT JUST TRADE LUXURY ITEMS OR ELSE THE SYSTEM MAY COLLAPSE AROUND YOU
AND NO AMOUNT OF THALER ( CURRENCY ) WILL HELP YOU OUT !!! THUS YOUR ACTION
DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME !



HISTORY IN BRIEF:

THE BALTIC TRADE STARTS WITH THE VIKINGS IN THE 8TH CENTURY.. FREQUENT
RAIDS OCCUR IN ENGLAND DENMARK AND NORWAY AND FRANCE... LEADING EVENTUALLY
TO THE MEDITERRANEAN.
THE VIKINGS SETUP TRADING POSTS ACROSS THE BALTIC AND SETTLEMENTS SPRUNG UP
AROUND THEM.... MERCHANTS STARTED TO TRADE LIMITED LOCAL GOODS AND
AGRICULTURE AND FISHING PLAYED A LARGE PART IN THE SUCCESS OF THE 
SETTLEMENTS.

THE VIKINGS TRADE DECLINED IN THE 11TH CENTURY AND THE CENTRES ALREADY
SETUP CONTINUED TO TRADE GOODS... WITH THE SLAVIC PEOPLES CONTINUING THE
SEA TRADING... BLOODY FUEDS OCCURED OVER WHO HAD WHICH ROUTES... AND SOME
TRADERS TEAMED UP TO OUST OTHER WEAKER TRADERS...POSSIBLY THE EARLIEST
SIGNS OF THE " HANSIATIC MERCHANTS LEAGUE ".

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND POLITICAL STABILITY AS WELL AS
TRANSPORT ...LED TO THE COASTAL TOWNS DOULBLING THE POPULATION IN GERMANY
PROGRESS WAS SLOW WITH RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS BECOMING INTEGRAL TO THE LIFESTYLE
OF THE PEOPLES. FEUDAL LORDS WERE PRESENT IN THE 12TH CENTURY AND THEY
IMPOSED CUSTOMS ON THE PEOPLE THEY GOVERNED... TAXES AT A LOCAL LEVEL WERE
INCURRED ON THE PEOPLE IN RETURN FOR PROTECTION. ( SOUNDS LIKE THE MAFIA ?)
VARIOUS COUNTRIES SPECIALISED IN PRODUCING RAW MATERIALS AND THIS TRADE
STRENGTHENED THE OVERALL PROGRESS ACROSS THE BALTIC AND EUROPE. TRADE
BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FLANDERS WITH WOOL FROM ENGLAND AND CLOTH WEAVING IN
FLANDERS FOUNDED THE HANSIATIC LEAGUE !

EMERGING FROM THIS TRADE SCENARIO WAS THE TOWN OF LUBECK WHICH ENJOYED
PARTICULAR SUCCESS WITH HENRY "THE LION" A SAXON DUKE... HE HELPED LUBECK
ENJOY A PHENOMENAL RISE TO SUCCES IN TRADIN PRIVILAGES.... HENRY FELL AFTER
REFUSING TO HELP HIS EMPEROR IN A FEUDAL MATTER BUT LUBECK SURVIVED AND
BECAME A TOWN OF THE RELAM AND WAS PROTECTED FROM THE TERRITORY
OVERLORDS... THUS OFFERING GOOD PROTECTION FOR THE SURFS WHO WANTED
FREEDOM. VARIOUS TOWNS AROSE IN THE REGION OF LUBECK.... ROSTOCK, WISMAR,
STRALSUND, DEMMIN, GREIFSWALD, ANKLAM AND HAMBURG. THIS RISE IN TRADING
POWER LED TO THE MONOPOLY OF THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE.

THE ACTIONS OF THE MERCHANTS IN THE 12TH CENTURY OPENED UP NEW TRADE ROUTES
IN THE EAST AS FAR AS GOTLAND. TRADING SPRED INTO SWEDEN AND NORWAY AND IN
THE 13TH CENTURY TRADE INCREASED IN FLANDERS AND THE TOWN OF BRUGES... THE
GERMANS TRADED CLOTH AND THE DECLINE OF FLANDERS TRADING OCCURRED AND THE
MONOPOLY OF THE GERMAN HANSEATICS INCREASED. HAMBURG AND LUBECK WERE
ESTABLISHED AS THE LEADERS IN TRADING BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FLANDERS AND AS
FAR AS NOVGOROD IN RUSSIA. NEWER AND BIGGER SHIPS AT THIS TIME INCREASED
THE WEALTH AND STRENGTH OF THESE " MERCHANT LEAGUES "... THUS THEY
DOMINATED THE SEAS UNTIL THE 15TH CENTURY ! DURING THIS TIME SEA PIRATES
WERE RIFE AND OFTEN MADE SIGNIFICANT TROUBLE FOR THE MERCHANTS..SO MUCH SO
THAT GUARD SHIPS  WERE PRESENT IN HARBOURS AND TRADING SHIPS CARRIED THEIR
OWN WEAPONS TO FIGHT WITH.  

BY PLAYING THE PATRICIAN YOU WILL BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS HISTORY AND HAVE
THE CHANCE TO RISE TO SUCCESS IN THE SAME WAY AS THE EARLY GERMAN MERCHANTS
DID. CAREFUL STRATEGY AND PLANNING WILL ENSURE YOUR RISE TO THE ULTIMATE
POSITION OF "THE PATRICIAN " !

THE MEDAEVAL GERMANY DURING THE TIME OF THE POWERFUL TRADING ORGANISATION

TOWNS TO BE HIS/HER HOME BASE AND AS A SHIP OWNER, SEND OUT HIS FLEET TO
SIXTEEN TOWNS TRADING IN EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF GOODS. BY CLEVER

FOR ALDERMAN OR PATRICIAN... IF YOU SUCCEED YOU HAVE WON THE GAME !

WHEN YOU PLAY THE PATRICIAN YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE PRICE OF GOODS IS NOT
FIXED AND IS INDEED DEPENDENT ON THE WAY THE GAME IS PLAYED. THE PRICE AND
SUPPLY OF PIG IRON AND LEATHER DICTATE THE PRODUCTION OF HARNESSES AND THE
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THE TOWN DEPENDS ON THE SUPPLY OF FOOD ! YOU CAN ALTER
THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF YOUR CHOSEN TOWN AND INFLUENCE THE WEALTH AND
SUCCESS OF THE TOWN AND IN DOING SO ENHANCE YOUR OWN STANDING AND " RUN "
FOR MAYOR ! NO TWO GAMES ARE THE SAME BECAUSE OF THESE FACTORS ! WATCH THAT
YOU DONT JUST TRADE LUXURY ITEMS OR ELSE THE SYSTEM MAY COLLAPSE AROUND YOU
AND NO AMOUNT OF THALER ( CURRENCY ) WILL HELP YOU OUT !!! THUS YOUR ACTION
DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THE GAME !



HISTORY IN BRIEF:

THE BALTIC TRADE STARTS WITH THE VIKINGS IN THE 8TH CENTURY.. FREQUENT
RAIDS OCCUR IN ENGLAND DENMARK AND NORWAY AND FRANCE... LEADING EVENTUALLY
TO THE MEDITERRANEAN.
THE VIKINGS SETUP TRADING POSTS ACROSS THE BALTIC AND SETTLEMENTS SPRUNG UP
AROUND THEM.... MERCHANTS STARTED TO TRADE LIMITED LOCAL GOODS AND
AGRICULTURE AND FISHING PLAYED A LARGE PART IN THE SUCCESS OF THE 
SETTLEMENTS.

THE VIKINGS TRADE DECLINED IN THE 11TH CENTURY AND THE CENTRES ALREADY
SETUP CONTINUED TO TRADE GOODS... WITH THE SLAVIC PEOPLES CONTINUING THE
SEA TRADING... BLOODY FUEDS OCCURED OVER WHO HAD WHICH ROUTES... AND SOME
TRADERS TEAMED UP TO OUST OTHER WEAKER TRADERS...POSSIBLY THE EARLIEST
SIGNS OF THE " HANSIATIC MERCHANTS LEAGUE ".

IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND POLITICAL STABILITY AS WELL AS
TRANSPORT ...LED TO THE COASTAL TOWNS DOULBLING THE POPULATION IN GERMANY
PROGRESS WAS SLOW WITH RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS BECOMING INTEGRAL TO THE LIFESTYLE
OF THE PEOPLES. FEUDAL LORDS WERE PRESENT IN THE 12TH CENTURY AND THEY
IMPOSED CUSTOMS ON THE PEOPLE THEY GOVERNED... TAXES AT A LOCAL LEVEL WERE
INCURRED ON THE PEOPLE IN RETURN FOR PROTECTION. ( SOUNDS LIKE THE MAFIA ?)
VARIOUS COUNTRIES SPECIALISED IN PRODUCING RAW MATERIALS AND THIS TRADE
STRENGTHENED THE OVERALL PROGRESS ACROSS THE BALTIC AND EUROPE. TRADE
BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FLANDERS WITH WOOL FROM ENGLAND AND CLOTH WEAVING IN
FLANDERS FOUNDED THE HANSIATIC LEAGUE !

EMERGING FROM THIS TRADE SCENARIO WAS THE TOWN OF LUBECK WHICH ENJOYED
PARTICULAR SUCCESS WITH HENRY "THE LION" A SAXON DUKE... HE HELPED LUBECK
ENJOY A PHENOMENAL RISE TO SUCCES IN TRADIN PRIVILAGES.... HENRY FELL AFTER
REFUSING TO HELP HIS EMPEROR IN A FEUDAL MATTER BUT LUBECK SURVIVED AND
BECAME A TOWN OF THE RELAM AND WAS PROTECTED FROM THE TERRITORY
OVERLORDS... THUS OFFERING GOOD PROTECTION FOR THE SURFS WHO WANTED
FREEDOM. VARIOUS TOWNS AROSE IN THE REGION OF LUBECK.... ROSTOCK, WISMAR,
STRALSUND, DEMMIN, GREIFSWALD, ANKLAM AND HAMBURG. THIS RISE IN TRADING
POWER LED TO THE MONOPOLY OF THE HANSEATIC LEAGUE.

THE ACTIONS OF THE MERCHANTS IN THE 12TH CENTURY OPENED UP NEW TRADE ROUTES
IN THE EAST AS FAR AS GOTLAND. TRADING SPRED INTO SWEDEN AND NORWAY AND IN
THE 13TH CENTURY TRADE INCREASED IN FLANDERS AND THE TOWN OF BRUGES... THE
GERMANS TRADED CLOTH AND THE DECLINE OF FLANDERS TRADING OCCURRED AND THE
MONOPOLY OF THE GERMAN HANSEATICS INCREASED. HAMBURG AND LUBECK WERE
ESTABLISHED AS THE LEADERS IN TRADING BETWEEN ENGLAND AND FLANDERS AND AS
FAR AS NOVGOROD IN RUSSIA. NEWER AND BIGGER SHIPS AT THIS TIME INCREASED
THE WEALTH AND STRENGTH OF THESE " MERCHANT LEAGUES "... THUS THEY
DOMINATED THE SEAS UNTIL THE 15TH CENTURY ! DURING THIS TIME SEA PIRATES
WERE RIFE AND OFTEN MADE SIGNIFICANT TROUBLE FOR THE MERCHANTS..SO MUCH SO
THAT GUARD SHIPS  WERE PRESENT IN HARBOURS AND TRADING SHIPS CARRIED THEIR
OWN WEAPONS TO FIGHT WITH.  

BY PLAYING THE PATRICIAN YOU WILL BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS HISTORY AND HAVE
THE CHANCE TO RISE TO SUCCESS IN THE SAME WAY AS THE EARLY GERMAN MERCHANTS
DID. CAREFUL STRATEGY AND PLANNING WILL ENSURE YOUR RISE TO THE ULTIMATE
POSITION OF "THE PATRICIAN " !
