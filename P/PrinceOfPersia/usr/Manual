                         PRINCE OF PERSIA - HINTS

Typed by SIDEWINDER of LSD.


PITS AND CHASMS
When you find yourself dropping down a pit, hold down the fire button and try
to cling onto a passing ledge.  In later levels, this sort of business is
absolutely necessary.

SPIKE 'N' TEETH
Spikes are found generally at the bottom of pits.  If you fall down a pit
towards some spikes, you're dead.  If there are spikes on the floor, however,
walking through them at normal speed will see you through.  Evading the teeth
is simply a matter of timing.

SWORDSMEN
In general, the swordsmen don't offer a particularly stiff challenge.  They
tend, instead, to catch you in tricky positions, forcing you backwards off
ledges and onto spikes etc.  The only really tough swordsman is found at the
end of Level 6.  The best policy is to adopt is one of caution.  Wait for the
guard to make his move and then strike.  After a successful hit, advance and
strike again immediately.  Don't stand around swinging your sabre
unnecessarily.
