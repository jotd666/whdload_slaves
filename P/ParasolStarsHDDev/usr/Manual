STATUS AND SCORING

IF NEITHER OF THEM ARE PLAYING THEN THIS SPACE WILL BE OCCUPIED WITH THE
MESSAGE PRESS FIRE AND THE NUMBER OF CREDITS. IF THERE ARE NO CREDITS LEFT
THEN THE GAME OVER WILL BE DISPLAYED. IF BOTH BUB AND BOB ARE PLAYING THEN
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MANY CREDITS YOU HAVE UNTIL ONE PLAYER DIES.

IN THE CENTER OF THE STATUS AREA IS A BLANK SPACE WHERE THE MIRACLE ICONS
WILL BE DISPLAYED WHEN YOU COLLECT THEM.

POINTS ARE SCORED BY COLLECTING OBJECTS AND BY DESTROYING THE MONSTERS.

EVERY FOOD ITEM COLLECTED WILL SCORE BETWEEN 10 POINTS AND 10,000 POINTS. ALL
BIG FOOD ITEMS WILL SCORE 100,000 POINTS.


TO GET POINTS FOR DESTROYING BADDIES YOU NEED TO THROW MONSTERS AGAINST EACH
OTHER WHEN THEY ARE PARALYZED (GREEN OR BLUE). YOU GET 2000 FOR THE FIRST
MONSTER YOU DESTROY THIS WAY, THEN 4000 THEN 8000, DOUBLING ALL THE TIME UP
TO 100,000 IF YOU DESTROY SEVEN OR MORE MONSTERS WITH A SINGLE THROW.


AN EXTRA LIFE IS AWARDED AFTER 100,000 POINTS AND THEN AFTER EVERY 1,000,000
POINTS.


AS THE FOOD YOU COLLECT BECOMES MORE VALUABLE THEN WATCH OUT FOR THE 100 COIN
- IT`S ONLY WORTH 100 POINTS, BUT IT GIVES YOU AN EXTRA CREDIT!


HOW TO PLAY

TO GET PAST EACH LEVEL YOU HAVE TO CLEAR IT ALL MONSTERS BEFORE YOUR TIME
RUNS OUT. IF IT DOES RUN OUT THE FOUL GAIKO WILL BEGIN ITS RELENTLESS PURSUIT
FROM WHICH THERE IS NO ESCAPE!


HOW TO DESTROY THE MONSTERS

TO DESTROY THE MONSTERS YOU FIRST HAVE TO PARALYSE THEM. THIS IS DONE BY
HITTING THEM WITH YOUR PARASOL, OR FOR THE STRONGER MONSTERS BY THROWING
OBJECTS AT THEM.
WHEN A MONSTER IS PARALYZED THEN IT WILL TURN GREEN (IF BUB PARALYZED IT) OR
BLUE (IF PARALYZED BY BOB).


WHEN A MONSTER IS PARALYZED YOU CAN DESTROY IT, EITHER BY PICKING IT UP AND
THROWING IT AGAINST THE WALL, OR BY THROWING SOMETHING ELSE AT IT.


HOW TO USE THE DRIPS AND DROPS

MOST LEVELS HAVE SOME SORT OF MAGIC DROPLETS DRIPPING AND ROLLING AROUND
THEM. YOU CAN COLLECT THESE DROPS ON TOP OF YOUR PARASOL AND THROW THEM AT
THE MONSTERS.
BUT BEST OF ALL, IF YOU COLLECT FIVE SMALL DROPS ON TOP OF YOUR PARASOL THEY
WILL MERGE TO GIVE YOU A MEGA-DROP.


THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF MEGA-DROP:
WATER DROP - UNLEASHES A TORRENTIAL CASCADE, WASHING EVERYTHING BEFORE IT!
FIRE DROP - FORMS A DEADLY FIELD OF FIRE WHEREVER IT FALLS!
LIGHTNING DROP - SHOOTS AN UNSTOPPABLE BOLT OF LIGHTNING ACROSS THE WORLD!
STAR DROP - SETS OFF A SPIRAL OF DEADLY SPINNING STARS!


HOW TO KEEP YOUR PARASOL UP

THE MOST IMPORTANT TECHNIQUE TO MASTER IS ATTACKING MONSTERS FROM BELOW. IF
YOU ARE STANDING BELOW A MONSTER THEN PUT YOUR PARASOL UP BY PRESSING FIRE
AND HOLDING THE JOYSTICK DOWN. THEN JUMP BY QUICKLY MOVING THE JOYSTICK UP.
YOUR PARASOL WILL REMAIN UP AND YOU SHOULD PARALYSE THE MONSTER. IF YOU JUMP
UP WITH THE PARASOL UP ABOVE YOUR HEAD THEN YOU CAN KEEP IT THERE BY QUICKLY
MOVING THE JOYSTICK DOWN WHILST STILL PRESSING FIRE.


HOW TO COLLECT OBJECTS

YOU CAN COLLECT OBJECTS BY WALKING OVER THEM OR BY THROWING SOMETHING OVER
THEM.
YOU CAN OFTEN FIND NEW OBJECTS BY THROWING SOMETHING OVER THE GROUND.
SOME OBJECTS JUST GIVE YOU POINTS, SOME GIVE YOU SPECIAL POWERS SUCH AS:-
MAGIC SHOES - HELPS YOU MOVE UP TO TWICE AS FAST.
HEARTS - GIVES YOU BONUS FOOD WHEN YOU FINISH A LEVEL.
CROOKS - LIKE A HEART BUT MORE!
POWER HEART - GIVE YOU DEADLY POWERS FOR A LIMITED TIME.
CLOCK - STOPS TIME FOR EVERYONE BUT YOU.
DIAMOND RING - UNLEASHES A DEADLY GLOWING STAR TO AID YOU!
BOMB - EXPLODES WITH CATASTROPHIC EFFECT!


THERE ARE FOUR VERY SPECIAL ITEMS - THE MIRACLE ICONS. EVERY TIME YOU COLLECT
ONE OF THESE IT WILL APPEAR AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN WHEN YOU HAVE COLLECTED
THREE YOU WILL GET A MIRACLE. IF YOU GET THREE CORRECTLY THEN THIS WILL OPEN
DOORS FOR YOU!!! THE MOST POWERFUL MIRACLE ICON IS THE PARASOL STARS!


END OF PLANET

EACH PLANET HAS SEVEN LEVELS, ON THE LAST LEVEL OF EACH WORLD THERE IS A
SPECIAL PLANETARY GUARDIAN. THIS CANNOT BE DEFEATED BY NORMAL MEANS. BUB AND
BOB MUST COLLECT THE POWER FLAGONS TO GIVE THEM TEMPORARY SPECIAL POWER.
IF YOU PUT YOUR PARASOL UP ABOVE YOUR HEAD (DOWN + FIRE) THEN YOU WILL
GENERATE DROPLETS ON IT WHICH CAN BE THROWN AT THE GUARDIAN, OR YOU CAN
CONTINUE GENERATING DROPLETS TO GET A MEGA-DROP.


HINTS AND TIPS


1: USE YOUR PARASOL TO THE FULL, IT CAN BE USED AS A WEAPON AND AS A SHIELD.
2: DESTROY THE MOST DANGEROUS MONSTERS FIRST, REMEMBER THE MOST DANGEROUS IS
NOT ALWAYS THE ONE THAT MOVES THE FASTEST!
3: COLLECT FOOD, FIND OUT WHERE FOOD IS GENERATED WHEN YOU THROW THINGS
ACROSS THE GROUND, USE THESE TO GET CREDITS AS YOU WILL NEED THEM LATER.
4: USE THE MEGA-DROPS, ESPECIALLY THE WATER, TO FLUSH OUT MONSTERS IN
DIFFICULT TO REACH PLACES.
5: YOU CAN JUMP ON LOTS OF THINGS - DROPS, PARALYZED MONSTERS AND THE OTHER
PLAYER`S PARASOL. QUITE OFTEN YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THIS WHEN GETTING OUT OF A
SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION.
6: WATCH THE DEMO MODE TO SEE HOW IT IS DONE BY AN EXPERT!
7: THERE IS A WAY IN - SOMEWHERE!
