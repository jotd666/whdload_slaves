                        PUGGSY FROM PSYGNOSIS

                    ***  FULL DOCUMENTATION  ***


Puggsy's in a mess. Not only is he stranded on an alien planet fifteen light
years from his home space station,stardock,but now he's had hisspaceship
stolen! there are bad days and they are really bad days!!!
And so puggsy's got a problem - major league.i mean, it's bad enough
losing your keys downtown without a ride home.Being stranded on a planet
without so much as a skateboard to get you around is a little more distressing
Not even Captain Kirk or mr.Spock had to cope with that! but, undeterred,
puggsy is determined to get his stolen spaceship back.

OPTIONS MENU:
Enter the options menu by highlighting the selection and pressing start.

MOVEMENT:
Puggsy can JUMP and PICK-UP,DROP & USE OBJECTS.

OPTIONS:
The options menu allows you to configure the controls as you like

LIVES:
Give puggsy heaps of lives to help him get his ship back!
Highlight the option by moving the arrow down with the joystick.
Each heart is a life. You may take up to 7 lives by moving in the right
direction. Minimise the number of lives and make the game all the harder
by moving left-giving puggsy fewer lives.

PASSWORDS:
Finally, you may punch in the appropriate passwords to enter later levels
to play.Once you have completed a section - such as THE BEACH, you can press
"P" on the keyboard and a password will be displayed. Jot down the password
(or should that be pass number) and should you want to rejoin the level at a 
later date, enter that password here by highlighting the appropriate
numbers and hitting the button to enter, or you can type the password in.

JUNIOR LEVEL:
Get accustomed to puggsy's little way by taking him through the junior
section - a section that's ideally suited to the younger player. Here you
will be gently hurled into puggsy's quest in the softest, most loveable
way possible. You'll also learn how to grap the gun and shoot things.
Oh what fun you will have.

PUGGSY'S AIM:
All puggsy wants is to get off the planet and get home. Plain and simple.
To do this, he must traverse most of the game levels, and leave by the 
exit!!. The thing is, that the island has a great many paths, some of which
might not lead towards puggsy's spaceship. Plus some levels may also have
more than one exit!It's up to you to make your way from level to level and 
not from level to dead end! Plus there are loads of special secret levels
and short cuts to help puggsy on his way.
Enter the exit carrying an object and you'll receive a hefty bonus. Carry
more than one object or a rare object and you'll receive an even heftier
bonus.

THE GAME:
Puggsy can walk left or right,jump,shoot,pick-up and run. But c'mon,
that's nothing special now is it. Well, that makes puggsy unique in the
Total Object Interaction to be found within the game. Puggsy can interact
with billions of onscreen objects which he must use to help him along.
Find thez box with a pair of sneakers in it,pick it up,press the button,
and puggsy will put them on and dash along like a sprinter. Grab the 
invincibility shield,press use,and hurl yourself into the rascally
racoons as if your life depend on it - because it doesn't - you're now
invincible! (for more on TOI, see the Object Section).
You'll discover all the objects along your journey but it's up to you 
to find out just what they're all for.Use the section at the back of
this manual to note down just what all the objects do. However on some 
levels, you'll be given clues to find a certain objects by the clue chest.
Open it and it'll tell you what object to look out fot.
Some of the objects you'll just stand on or have to position in
strategically important places to finish the level. Others, you must
use in a certain way. But it's down to your ingenuity to decide just
how to use them. If you get struck on a screen restart it, without even
losing a life, by pressing ESCAPE.

CONTROLLING PUGGSY:
The height puggsy jumps is dependent on the lenght of time jump is held.
There are therefore thousands of variations available to puggsy at any 
time. Plus, apart from just allowing puggsy to jump around, you can
also squash mostenemies by jumping on top of them and pressing down.
The PICK-UP/DROP button allows puggsy to - yeah right. If puggsy is 
close to an object, press this button and he'll pick it up - assuming
he's not already holding one. Press the button again and he'll drop it.
It's a cinch. And if two objects are piled on top of each other,grab
either the top or bottom one by moving puggsy's arms up or down (using
either the up or down control) and then the pick-up button. Easy.
Also, puggsy has a special throw. Rather than just dropping the object
puggsy's carrying, try pressing the direction arrows either up or
diagonally upwards and pressing drop. The objects will be hurled in
the direction you've chosen. And that's really handy because if the 
object hits any enemy from above, then they'll really know about it!
When trying to jump onto objects that are too high for puggsy, puggsy
can use objects in his grasp to help him get a grip on the surface and 
haul himself upwards. Once puggsy is trying to grip on a ledge with the
object, keep holding the direction control downwards in the direction
that puggsy wants to jump. That way,he'll have no problem in making
it (usually!!).
A final couple of points. If puggsy finds himself on top of a pile of
objects, pressing down lets him drop through the objects one at a time.
And if you find things are happening just a little too quickly, then
pause the game at a many time by hitting the key "P".

HAPPENINGS:

On most levels, happenings can be found. These can usually be identified
by the fact that something is happening or is about to happen. This 
happening must happen in order for you to complete the level. Confused??
it's OK. So are we.......
Happenings take the form of switches,locks,ropes,cannons and several
trillion other mechanisms which must be used to continue to the next level.
These items can be activated by objects found on that level. For example,
you see a cannon on the screen. Find and pick-up the match, walk to the 
cannon, drop the match onto the cannon and the cannon fires. Find a switch,
get any solid object and walk into the switch with the object and that 
switch will be switched and, if you drop an object near it, will stay
switched!!

OBJECTS:

Puggsy uses a fantastic system called Total Objects Interaction (TOI)
This means that all the objects play a vital part in completing the game.
It also means that they act and interact exactly as they would if you 
were using them in the real world (well,more or less.I mean you wouldn't
want things to be as boring as in real life now would you??).All objects
can be moved,thrown,stood upon,stacked,and used.They are subject to 
gravity,bounce,float (or swim) in the water,get blown around by fans
and so on. Also,each object has its own weight. If puggsy is carring a
heavy object,he cannot jump as high as if he was carrying a light object.
On the other hand, if puggsy is getting blown around by a fan,holding a 
weighty object might let him walk towards it more easily. Obviously,
heavy objects cannot be thrown as far as light ones but light objects
will be affected much more by fans. Buoyant objects will float in water
and if puggsy stands on a few of these,he can stand water without
getting wet! Similarly,he can pump up balloons,hold ontothem and float
up into the air as they rise!
Bear in mind that there are usually no simple no single fixed solutions
to a problem so it's up to you to use your ingenuity to solve them.

MAP SCREEN:

After each level,you'll see an end of level screen followed by a map
of the entire island.The square box to the left shows where you've
just been and offers you a new destination.Move the tiny puggsy in
the picture along the patch with the direction control to progress
through the game. If you come to a dead end, you can retrace your
steps on this screen.Press fire to enter the level. 

SPACE removes the magnified box to the right of the screen
KEY B views the password.enter it on the options screen to begin
at your present stage.
RETURN shows all the world guardians. Guardians with a line through
them have already been defeated.
FIRE enters the selected level.

GUARDIANS:

Every so often, you'll encounter a guardian. He's there to try and
stop puggsy getting his space ship back and must be defeated. There
are 6 evil guardians,with between 3 & 6 hit points.

POLLY PIRATE:
Polly jumps around firing at puggsy. All puggsy has to defend
himself is the odd fish that gets washed up on deck.Position puggsy
near the fish and fire it at polly.
THE EMPEROR'R OLD CLOTHES:
This fella throws his gloves at puggsy. Little does he know that
the ball that's rolling over his head can be dropped by puggsy
using the switches on the floor!.
SO PHARAOH SO GOOD:
Beware! the pharoe nose how to get puggsy.But if puggsy steps
on the pressure pads,he can get the pharaoh! simple.
FLOUR POWER:
The nasty miller is throwing bags of flour at our puggsy whose
only defence is to catch the bags with the grabber and dump
them over the miller's head using the conveyor belt.
HALITOSIS THE DRAGON:
Avoid his breath at all costs! When you get the chance,sneack
near him and sock him in the jaw.
IF LOOKS COULD KILL!
This is the big boy! with laser beam eyes,deathly bound and
a nasty habit of dropping mines on you, puggsy has got his
work cut out. The only way to defeatthis chap is to give him
a taste of his own medicine.
