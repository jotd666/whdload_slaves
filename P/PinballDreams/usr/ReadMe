History:

Version 1.9 (30.06.2021): done by JOTD

- fixed ignition table original bug: after completing the solar system
  (fuel+left ramp many times) the game crashed / triggered an access fault
  
Version 1.8 (10.04.2021): done by JOTD

- older versions actually required 1MB chip. This version really
  requires 512k chipmem and a little fastmem
- minor source code cleanup

Version 1.7 (12.07.2020): done by JOTD

- joystick controls only worked with joypads, not plain joysticks (issue #0004704)

Version 1.6 (24.06.2020): done by JOTD

- allow to play with only 2 classical joysticks (if no CD32 joypad is available)
- fixed erratic joypad readings. This was done by re-enabling vertical blank just
  to read joypad at this very moment (and not when the game originally read the controls)
- fixed intro music replay (damn empty dbf soundtracker replay loops x6)

Version 1.5 (02.08.2019): done by JOTD

- fixed lockup with black screen when quitting table (issue #0002814)
- fixed install script (issue #0004160)

Version 1.4-B (17.07.2019): done by JOTD

- fixed issue #0004156 (installation directory error)

Version 1.4 (13.07.2019): done by JOTD
- CD32 joypad support / full keyboardless controls
- CUSTOM1=1 skips introduction
- adapted to whdload 17
- 68000 quitkey
- lmb or joyfire can now be used to skip intro credits
- resourced/merged from v1.1 source & v1.3 binary (Galahad can't find 1.3 duh...)
- removed "must be registered" restriction (well, not really useful...)
- source file incuded

Version 1.3 (2003): done by Galahad
- NTSC version now supported
- Installer and nice icons by Frank
- Slave optimised further
- Registered users only
- Quit option is 'F10'

Version 1.1: done by Galahad
- System Friendly disk Imager used
- 2 more versions supported (NTSC version to follow)
- All REAL files located in data directory

Version 1.0: done by Galahad
- Full load from Hard drive (REAL files!)
- Lame-o-Protect removed (Custom TSL MFM format)
- Load/Save Hiscores to Hard drive
- Decrunch routine relocated to fast ram
- Quit option is 'Del'


EXTRA NOTES:

Special thank you to Quietust who sprang out of nowhere to offer his NTSC
version.... I've only been waiting two years!!! :)

I am not aware of any other versions of Pinball Dreams that need supporting,
if you know otherwise, let me know.
 
Enjoy this modern classic.

Regards, Galahad, JOTD, Bert, Frank, John and Quietust


CD³² joypad controls: 

Red           - start game / add a player (numerical enter)
Down		  - launch ball               (return)
Rev/Forward   - left/right flippers       (left/right amiga/shift/alt keys)
Up            - nudge table upwards       (space bar)
Play		  - pause game                (p)
Green         - quit                      (ESC)
Yellow        - confirm quit              (Y)
Blue          - right flipper
Left          - left flipper

menu options:
- red: ignition
- blue: steel wheel
- yellow: beat box
- green: nightmare

If CUSTOM2 is set the controls try to use only standard joystick (port 1) inputs so:

Red           - start game / add a player (numerical enter)
Down		  - launch ball               (return)
Up            - nudge table upwards       (space bar)
Right         - right flipper
Left          - left flipper

control keys are achieved through joystick (port 0)

Joy2 button 1  - escape
Joy2 left      - Y
Joy2 right     - N

menu options:
- left: ignition
- right: steel wheel
- down: beat box
- up: nightmare

Of course, that setting isn't practical with a joystick because you cannot use left+right at the same time, but
the person who asked for this feature wants to create an arcade cabinet so it's not a problem activating left+right

to enter hiscore, you need keyboard. If you don't have a keyboard, you can
still skip this part by entering "Y" (yellow), "P" (play) or "space" (up). It won't
be your initials, okay, just change your name to Yander Price and it will be fine.

(with CUSTOM2 set, use the joystick in port 0 left/right to enter Y or N)
