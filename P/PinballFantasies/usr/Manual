GENERAL INFORMATION
===================
The Jackpot is a score counter which is built up by all participating
players during the game. It is reset each time a Jackpot is awarded
to a player.
Many of the lights on the tables have letters on them which enable
special features as follows:

XB   =   Extra ball          JP   =   JackPot
DB   =   Double bonus        xM   =   Score x million points
SB   =   Score bonus         5x   =   Score 5 times feature points
HB   =   Hold bonus          MB   =   Bonus multiplier
x/xK =   Score x thousands

A flashing light is often a hint as to where you can raise your score
and collect the bonuses.
At the end of your game the last but one digit of your score will be
shown in the panel. Random numbers will then be flashed across the
panel and one will be selected. If your number matches the random
number you are awarded an extra ball and can continue from where you
left off.
