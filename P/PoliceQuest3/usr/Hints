      get  the  suspect's  driver's  license,  click  it on your car's 
      computer screen. Select  Form 900. Now enter the  time you wrote

      extreme right then to the extreme left a couple of times. Search 
      the drunk by using the hand icon. Select the handcuffs from your

      in a team to help you. Return to the station. At the station, go 
      to the evidence  booking room and book the  photo, the sample of 
      blood and hair,  the news clipping, the cult  book, and the cult 
      ring.  Then go  to the  courthouse.  Talk  to the  judge in  the 
      judge's  chambers, and  she will  grant your  request for  help. 
      Return to the crack house. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      I'm back at the crack house. How do I proceed? 
 
      Hint: 
      Exit your car and draw your  weapon. To draw your weapon, select 
      the gun from  inventory and click it on Sonny.  Walk to the left 
      side of  the crack house door.  Click the Talk icon  on the ram. 
      After the door is broken down, enter the house. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      What do I do inside the crack house? 
 
      Hint: 
      When you enter the house, a  suspect will fire at you. Place the 
      cross hairs on the suspect and immediately return fire. A second 
      suspect will appear and surrender. Walk behind him and cuff him. 
      After  the backup  officer walks  the suspect  out of the house, 
      lift up the cushion on the  sofa and take the TV remote control. 
      Click the control icon on the TV and push button 8. 
 
 
      Problem: 
      I've discovered a secret room! What do I do? 
 
      Hint: 
      Walk  through the  fireplace with  your gun  drawn. A  dangerous 
      third suspect is  waiting for you behind the  barrels down here. 
      As soon as  you spot him, place the cross  hairs on him and fire 
      immediately. Congratulations!  You've broken Lytton's  drug cult 
      ring!
