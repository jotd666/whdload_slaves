 Note on AGA & CD남 game:

 The game requires an installed A1200 or A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40068.A1200" (resp kick40068.A4000). 
 The image can be extracted from a A1200 (resp A4000) with tools like 'GrabKick'
 or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick40068.A1200.RTB" (resp "kick40068.A4000.RTB")
 must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart image.
 It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

 For the full WHDLoad package, other installs and updates refer to:

History

 version 3.1 (05.12.2020) done by JOTD:
 - Highscores are properly saved in the "nvram" file, using Bert new
   nonvolatile emulation
 - Fixed crash (issue #0004869) introduced in 3.0
 - Fixed: clicking with left mouse button during the pinball selection
   just froze the game. This bug is triggered by an original cd32 menu
   "feature" that calls exec.Debug on left click, probably
   to debug the game, but that was left in in the final release...
 - CD32: using lowlevel library emulation instead of real lowlevel library code
   (fixes issues with some A1200 motherboards rev 1B or whatever)
 - Can skip intro in CD32 version
 - fixed the way fastmem slave patches memory allocation,
   A4000 kick3.1 image now supported (worked only on A1200 kick3.1 image)

 
 version 3.0-B (14.11.2020) done by JOTD:
 - fixed rawdic imager (had trouble reading one of the disks...)
 
 version 3.0 (11.11.2020) done by JOTD
 - AGA/CD32 version: changed the way the game saves/loads highscores,
   which has caused numerous problems all over the years. Hopefully will fixed
   issue #0002193)

 version 2.7 (10.03.2018)
 - Added quitkey for 68000 in ECS version (issue #3713). Quitkey doesn't work during the introduction

 Version 2.5 (14.08.2006)
 - AGA/CD남: another slave provided for weird fast memory configurations

   error message. It will be slower, but it will work)
 - AGA/CD남: pre-check for nv location directory to avoid trouble during game

 Version 2.4 (11.11.2005)
 - Better fonts in the AGA menu (Thanks Bert)
 - Fixed install script
 - reworked readme

 Version 2.3 (08.08.2004)

   in-game errors (volume WHDLoad: is write protected). Create if absent.

   * VBR stuff removed

 - Rewritten installer script
 - Added icons
 - Added manual

 Version 1.0 (31.12.1997) done by Mr.Larmer/Wanted Team
 - Initial release (ECS only)

Notes on AGA/CD32 version: with some memory configurations,
because of the game using MSB to store stuff
(which highly buggy and 24-bit compatible only), I had to use
tricks to decode those addresses on the fly. The result is that
it's not possible to use expansion memory in 0x7Fxxxxxx.

Someone on EAB (http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=36535) got rid
of this problem by allocating the memory blocks $7f000000-7ff7ffff
with a small tool from aminet (probably http://aminet.net/package/dev/misc/allocate)
before starting the game. Ugly, but works better than the chip-only slave which seem
to have issues.

Using fast memory on AGA/CD32 version makes this game really faster,
specially on high-end accelerator boards where running code in chipmem
is slow as hell (Blizzard 060...)

On WinUAE using chipset hack setting to force audio issues, I get trashed
music at startup, but I can't seem to fix it the way I usually fix it, so
I just hope that it doesn't happen on real amigas but is just a WinUAE-only
"feature" (chipset_hacks=0x8)
