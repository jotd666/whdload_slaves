 This install applies to "Premiere" (floppy/CD³²) © 1992/1994 Core Design

 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found

 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly

COMMENTS:

Core Design released this ECS game, and they added patches for faster CPUs (there were
GFX bugs in the scrolling), but I had to modify the patches, else the game crashed
on 68020 with cache. Else, it's the same version as the floppy one (once again).

The "SPARKPLUGS" cheatmode is useless now, and you can skip levels without having
infinite lives.

THANX TO Chris Vella for sending me the original floppies and bug reports in the
install script.

description of the CUSTOM options:

CUSTOM1=1: trainer
CUSTOM2=1: 2nd button jumps (up still used to enter the doors)
CUSTOM3=1: start with sfx by default
CUSTOM4=0-11: start level

Note about levelskipper:

If you use levelskip when on "backstage" (not the main theme, after entering a door where there are cameras,
paint pots, Chuck Rock statues, etc...), it kind of works, but in the next level, when entering the backstage
again, tiles are trashed. So avoid that.
