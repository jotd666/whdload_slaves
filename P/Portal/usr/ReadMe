 This install applies to "Portal" © 1986 Activision

 Thanks to Tony Aksnes & BTTR for original disk images

 This install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both can be found in
 the WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.0 (23.12.2022) done by JOTD:
 - now uses real files, no longer diskimages, which allows
   original version to be really supported (else a copy had to
   be used in the previous install) (issue #0004979)
 - fixed blitter issues on fast machines (blitter wait not called
   between graphics.library calls)
 - ability to skip introduction
 
 version 1.0 (10.09.2003) done by JOTD:
 - initial release
 - disk protection removed
 - full use of fastmem & caches for awesome speed
 - original & BTTR versions supported
 - quit option quits to WB
 - manual included
 - icons by Exoticon
 - source code included

 Notes:

    Upgrading from 1.0 to 2.0 requires reinstalling but you can do it from the
 v1.0 disk.x images as they're DOS disk images that can be mounted or even
 selected from the installer.

    The new install takes a while from floppies because there are more than
 500 files! Disk 3 is specially slow to install. Use "install from disk images"
 for better speed.
