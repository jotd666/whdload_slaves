 It can be quit by pressing Num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly

In-game keys:

 - Ctrl-R: quit current game & go to main game menu
 - Ctrl-S: sound on/off
 - Ctrl-L: load game (from main game menu)
 - Ctrl-G: save game (level 3 and higher, but not last level)
   (if cheat is set, game can be saved at any level)
 - Ctrl-V: show game version
 - Ctrl-Q: quit to workbench (used to reboot) (QWERTY keyboard)
 - Ctrl-A: restart level (QWERTY keyboard)
 - Shift-L: skip levels but not above to level 4 & sets timer to 15 minutes
   (if cheat is set timer isn't changed and all levels can be skipped)
 - Space: show remaining time
 - Esc: pause
 - Joystick/Numerical keypad:  directions
 - Fire/Right Amiga: fire
 - 5 on keypad: give up fight

Notes:

 - After reloading a game, CTRL key must be pressed before Shift-L can be used
 - If trainer (infinite time/energy) is set, Ctrl-G has no effect, and high scores are not saved
 - when using trainer infinite energy and falling in pits
   the level doesn't auto-restart. Use Ctrl-A to restart level manually
 - the second/blue button jumps, but "up" is not suppressed. This was too complex to
   reverse-engineer for sword fight and pull up when hanging, and most of all not
   that annoying to still have "up" for jump in that case. The second button jump is
   still a very good asset with the joypad to avoid failing a diagonal jump and dying...
 - reloc tables were specially created to be able to run that game from fast memory.
   To upgrade your installation, just copy those .reloc files in the game data directory.
   The slave selects the proper one automatically according to game version.
