 4D BOXING AMIGA ADDENDUM CARD
 -----------------------------

 This Amiga version of 4D Sports Boxing Has Been Supplied with the PC
 manual. The operation of the Amiga version of 4D Sports Boxing is
 identical to the PC version but some aspects of the installation
 procedures are different are are outlined below.

 4D Sports Boxing will work on the following machines.

 An AMIGA 500,500 Plus,1000, 2000 and 3000 with a least 1Mb Of Ram.

 A Faster processor and a hard disk drive are recommended, although
 they are not essential.
 
 The game is controlled via Keyboard, Mouse or Joystick. In a two player
 game, any combination of keyboard and joystick can be used toi control
 the fight.

 SETUP AND INSTALLATION
 ----------------------
 Hard Disk Installation

 Reset your Amiga and load the WORKBENCH disk supplied with your machine.
 Insert BOXING DISK 1 into any drive. The screen will display a disk icon
 labelled 4D SPORTS BOXING. Double click on the icon in the normal
 fashion and a window will open containing an icon called HDINSTALL. Click
 on HDINSTALL and follow the on screen instructions swapping disks when
 prompted.

 PLAYING FROM HARD DISK
 ----------------------
 USERS WITH 512K CHIP RAM:-

 From WORKBENCH double click the mouse pointer on the SHELL or CLI icon.
 Change to the directory type `4DBOXING' and then press the `ENTER' key.

 Should the program terminate through a lack of memory you will need to
 free up as much CHIP RAM as possible. The best way to do this is to edit 
 the startup-sequence and remove the loadwb command. Check your Amiga manual
 to see how to do this.

 USERS WITH 1MB OF CHIP RAM:-

 Whilst in WORKBENCH, Select the 4D SPORTS BOSING drawer by double clicking
 its icon. This will open the drawer and show an icon called 4D SPORTS
 BOXING which you then double click to start the game.

 PLAYING FROM FLOPPY DISK:-
 
 Reset your Amiga and insert the disk when the WORKBENCH Disk request
 screen is displayed. Insert Disk 1 in DF0: and the game will load 
 automatically. Insert disks as and when requested throughout the rest
 of the game.

 IMPORTING/EXPORTING BOXERS:-
 
 To Save off your own creations of mean fighter machines you will have to
 create data disks to store them on. Format diskettes using the
 WORKBENCH format.initialise command and label them DATA DISK. When you
 have created a boxer the game will request this DATA DISK. Insert the disk
 when you are prompted. Please note that each formatted disk will only store
 one boxer.

 PLAYING CONTROLS:-
 
 The manual refers to `FIRE BUTTON 2', Which is specific to the PC version.
 On the Amiga, FIRE BUTTON 2 is emulated by the appropriate `SHIFT KEY'
 on the keyboard.

 HYDR0 NOTE:- Thats The End Of The Addendum Card.

 select the correct controlling input device.

 The boxer is capable of a wide variety of moves depending on the
 situation. For example, the "showboating" moves change depending
 on wether the opponent is on this feet or not. There is also a secret
 move to help bring back energy yo the dangerously exhasted fighter.
 We think you should find that one out for yourself.

 THE MASTER PANEL
 ----------------

 During a fight you can press ESCape to bring up the MASTER PANEL. This
 allows access to 4D Sports Vision camera and video replay control systems
 and other functions of the game. This menu can be accessed by clicking on
 the CONTROLS icon before the fight and between each round. There are eight
 icons on the Master Panel. From Left To Right.

 1.> A Boxer Throwing A Towel Into The Ring.
 2.> A Camera.
 3.> A Video Tape.
 4.> Sum Eyes.
 5.> A Thin N Fat Boxer
 6.> A Document.
 7.> A Disk.
 8.> A Done Icon.

 Let`s look at these menu options in more detail:

 1.>THROW IN THE TOWEL - terminates the fight as a TKO. Against you except
 if the fight hasn`t started yet!. This allows you to cancell a fight
 without penalty - except for maybe incurring your manager`s wrath.
 2.>VIEW OPTIONS MENU - Allows the player to set, position and adjust the
 8 user definable cameras.
 3.>INSTANT REPLAY MENU - The icon accesses the 4D Sports Vision replay
 system, allowing the player to review the fight so far and play back 
 portions of the action.
 4.>POINT OF VIEW MENU - Allows quick selection of the viewpoint between
 action through thr cameras or through either of the boxer`s eyes.
 5.>RENDERING LEVEL - here the player selects the rendering level and 
 playwindow size. See also FRAME RATE.
 6.>STATISTIC - This icon brings up a list of the fight stats recorded
 for the fight so far and the last round in detail.
 7.>SYSTEM PANEL - From here the player can save and load cmaera settings
 and control music and sound effects.
 8.>DONE. Returns you to the previous menu, or directly back to the fight
 if the menu was access during a round.

 1.> Throw in the towel - This permits the player to terminate a fight
     before it has reached its natural conclusion. If you do this, the
     computer will automatically register a TKO against you. If this is 
     done during a MAIN EVENT fight, then this will effect your career 
     standings. This was included to prevent the unscrupulous boxers
     amongst you from winning fights withour going the full distance -
     no chance to take a dive here!.

     If the fight has not yet statted, you can quit withour any penalty
     whatsoever.
 
 2.> View Options - allows the player to enter the VIEW OPTIONS PANEL and
     manipulate the various camera viewing systems. Once selected, there
     are seven icons displayed. From left to right these are:

     A Plus Sign : Step Up to the next camera in the sequence
     A Minus Sign: Step back to the previous camera in the sequence
     Adjust      : Adjust the cameras. See also section "Adjusting Cameras"
     A Standing Camera : Flying/Fixed camera. This toggles between a camera
                         that can fly around the track the action or is
                         "Locked Off" in a set position.
     A Man Holding A Camera : Cameraman On/Off. This toggles between that is
                              "operated" by an intelligent computer
  		              controlled cameraman who tracks the action
                              smoothly as you would see on TV or fixed
                              camera.
     A Crowd     : Crowd On/Off. THis toggles between a computer generated
                   rendered crowd or a blank background. Note: when this
                   icon is selected. the camera is automatically fixed and
                   locked off with no cameraman that will not track the
                   action..
     Control     : Control room. This icon displays all 9 cameras together
                   and allows you to set up combined camera views that gives
                   the best coverage of the ring and the action. Toggles
                   it to return to the main panel.
    Done         : DONE. Returns you to the MASTER PANEL.

 3.> Instant replay

 The key to the 4D Sports series is the ability to really recreate the
 atmosphere and excitement of a full scale sports event. One of the
 abilities we have with the 4D Sports graphic system is to record the
 action onto a "Digital" video tape. You can then rewind and re-play
 sections of the fight to impress your friends with your incredible skill
 and more importantly, carefully analyse your opponents strengths and
 weaknesses before going in for the kill. The 4D Sports Vision instant
 replay system lets you re-live and last round fought and to rewind
 and fast forward through the action so you can find the moment of glory
 (or disaster) that you want to see again.

 Once selected, there are eight icons displayed. From left to right, they
 are:-

 |<<    i)Rewind to the beginning of the round.

  <<    ii) Rewind manually. "HOLD" this button down until the desired
          portion of the fight is displayed on screen.

  >     iii) Play

  >|    iv) Frame advance -allows the action to be examined step by step
          to really see the details.

  ||    v) Pause. Toggle this on and off to freeze and continue the replay.

  >>    vi) Fast forward manually. "HOLD" this button down until the desired
         portion of the fight is displayed on screen.

 >>|    vii) Fast forward to end of round.

 Done Viii) DONE!. returns you to the MASTER PANEL.
   ___________________________
  |_________|__|______________|

 Frame Rate Slider - adjust the slider left to right to increase and
 decrease the frame rate. 100% is normal speed. A lower figure means
 slow motion, a higher figure increases the speed. This can be adjusted
 during the replay.

 4) Point Of View - From this menu, the player can quickly select the
    viewpoint form either a camera, the Red boxer or Blue Boxer.
    Once selected, there are four icons displayed. Form left to right,
    they are:

    Camera    : Camera View - Shows views from the movable cameras. See
                also section on "Adjusting Cameras".
    Dark Eye  : View through Red Boxer`s eyes [or use F9 during the fight]
    Light Eye : View through Blue Boxer`s eyes [or use F10 during fight]
    DONE      : DONE. Returns you to the MASTER PANEL.

 5) Rendering - This menu allows the player to adjust the detail of
                graphics used to create the boxer`s shape and features.
                This has a fundamental effect on the speed and
                smoothness of the RATE for more information about processor
                speed and adjusting frame rates to get optimum performance
                out of the game.
    Once selected, there are six icons displayed. From Left To Right,
    They Are:

  Fat Man To Thin : Increase detail level, Adds polygons to the boxers to
                    increase detail level and therefore realism at the
                    expense of frame rate on slower machines.

  Thin Man To Fat : The Total Reverse Of The Upper Text!.

  Auto            : Auto. This puts an automatic system into operation that
                    selects the optimum graphics level to provide the ideal
                    playing speed and frame rate. Note: this system will
                    operate constantly and will therefore make "unexpected"
                    changes to the graphics level during the fight.
                    This is to compensate for a heavy demand momentarily
                    on your computer`s processor by the game for some
                    "hidden" task.
 Box With Arrows
         Going In : Decrease playwindow size. The smaller the playwindow
                    the faster the frame rate becomes. On slower machines
                    it may be necessary to decrease the size slightly in
                    order to get a better game speed.

 Box With Arrows

 TWO PLAYER MODE
 ---------------

 One of the best features of 4D Sports Boxing is the ability for two player
 to fight each other on the same computer.

 They can even use the same keyboard.

 Select a control input device from the OPTIONS panel via the MAIN MENU
 for the two players. Assign the correct joystick or keyboard patch for
 the player and then preceed to either the EXHIBITION or MAIN EVENT
 sections for the fight.

 A third person can usefully be employed as 4D Sports Vision director
 changing camera angles during the round and showing replays and
 adjusting camera angles between rounds.

 ADJUSTING CAMERAS
 -----------------

 During the fight, it is possible to access any of the camera angles by
 simply pressing the associated function key (F1-F10) for each camera
 setting. However, it is easy to set up your own camera positions and
 angles - and of course much more fun than using the presets. Follow
 the instructions below and you will soon become the best TV director
 in your street.

 To enter the Camera Adjust menu, go into the MASTER PANEL. To do this
 either prsss ESCape during a fight, or select controls from the top
 level "Fight or Controls" menu.

 Once in the Master Panel select the VIEW OPTIONS icon to enter into
 the VIEW OPTIONS panel. Next select ADJUST and you will go into the
 panel that allows the cameras to be positioned and adjusted by the
 player. Once selected, there are eight icons displayed. Form left
 to Right, They Are:

 A + Sign           i) Step Up to the next camera in the sequence.
 A - Sign          ii) Step Down to the previous camera in the sequence.
 2 Cameras        iii) Adjust the current camera view
 1 Camera & 2 Guys iv) Select camera focus on either or both boxers.
 Arrow Up           v) Zoom In.
 Arrow Down        vi) Zoom Out.
 Save             vii) Save.
 Done            viii) Done. Return you to the View Options Panel.

 To select any camera from the nine available foe user definition, move up
 and won through the cameras with the STEP UP and STEP DOWN icons until
 the desired cameras view is displayed.

 Go to the ADJUST icon and press and hold FIRE BUTTON 1 Or ENTER. With the
 button or key syill depressed, move around in the 8 directions to adjust
 the position of the camera with the joystick or keyboard. Follow the
 chart below fot the camera move availble:


               FORWARD
      MOVE UP    /\    MOVE UP
             \\  ||  //
              \\ || //
 ROTATE LEFT ========== ROTATE RIGHT
              // || \\
    MOVE DOWN//  ||  \\MOVE DOWN
                 \/
              MOVE BACK

 Using the above moves, it is possible to position the camera anywhere within
 the 4D Sports arena. NOTE: It is not possible to adjust the camera on the
 F1 Key. It is always fixed in the same position.

 Next select which boxer, or both, you wish to centre and focus the camera
 on. Toggle through the SELECT camera focus icon until the desired choice
 is shown.

 Use ZOOM In to get closer to the action and ZOOM OUT to come back out for
 a wider camera shot.

 Repeat this for all the available cameras until you are happy with the
 angles and focuses the you have set up. Remember that you change the
 settings in the middle of a fight with no penalty to your success if you
 want to tweak a camera position slightly.

 Once the settings are complete, select SAVE to store them for future use.

 Select DONE to return to the VIEW OPTIONS PANEL. From here it is possible
 to set the type of camera and how it follows the action. See the
 descriptions of the icons in the previous section and also read the section
 headed FRAME RATE before making your choices.

 If you select a camera to be "Flying" then it will track the action
 smoothly. If a "locked" or static camera is used. then during the fight
 press the SPACEBAR to re-centre the camera on the action.

 CROWDS
 ------

 It is possible to add a textured and rendered crowd into the background
 behind the ring. NOTE: it is  only possible to have a fixed camera and
 a crowd included together, which is why when you select the Crowd icon,
 it automatically chooses a fixed camera that has no operator.

 With the 4D Sports Vision System it is possible to place a camera right
 inside the ring that flies around with the action. No TV sports show in
 the world ever gives you the freedom to see the action so close. Mind
 you don`t get hit, though!

 FRAME RATE
 ----------
 4D Sports Boxing uses mathematically generated polygons to creat the
 onscreen graphics. Because of the complexity of the programming
 algorythms required to do the mathematical calculations, polygon
 graphics take a large proportion of your computers available processing
 power. On faster machines with a 286 or 386 processor chip this is not
 a problem, since there is ample power "in reserve" to handle the most
 intensive task. However, if you are running the game on a less powerful
 computer (e.g. one with a clock speed of less than 10mhz) then you may
 encounter situations in the game where the frame rate of amnimations
 and graphics slows down.

 There are a number of features built into the game that allows you to
 speed up the frame rate on your computer. The following is a list of
 suggestions that we recommend you try in order to get the optimum
 preformance out of this product. However , since different PC`s behave
 in different ways, we suggest you experiment to achieve the optimium
 frame rate by trying these simple options:

 1) Decrease the RENDERING LEVEL of the boxers.  This removes polygons
 form the human figure and therefore the computer has less graphics to
 calculate for each frame of animation. You can select the AUTO options
 from the RENDERING menu so that the game decides for you the best
 rendering level to use.

 2) Decrease the playwindow size. This takes the visible screen area
 down tp a more manageable level for slower machines.

 3) Cameras. If frame rate is a problem on your machine, then select
 cameras to have no cameraman and for them to be fixed. This decrease
 the calculations required for the game to follow the action.
 - Thus increasing visible fram rate.

 4) LOW and HIGH SIM. From the OPTIONS panel it is possible to select LOW
 or HIGH simulation level for the game. If LOW sim is selected, it
 removes a proportion of the artificial intelligence for the opponents
 boxers. This means there are less calculations to do for the fight and
 you get a marginally better frame rate.

 5) Sound. POn slower machines with no sound card, selecting digital
 sounds through the PC SPEAKER can have an adverse effect on the
 overall frame rate - especially during sound intensive portions of the
 fight. If This is a problem, simply select PC SPEAKER from the Set-Up
 menu.

 4D SPORTS BOXING "THE CHAMPIONSHIP"
 -----------------------------------

 Once you have tried out a few boxers in the EXHIBITION match and set up
 the camera angles  it is time for the BIG FIGHT. This where your Boxing
 career takes  off. Make a big and you are going to be a rich man, If
 you fail... well it will be back to normal life again - no fast cars,
 big houses. Yes, you can wave goodbye to the good life and everything that
 goes with it.


 THE GYM
 -------

 Before you can enter the Championship you must first create your own boxer
 and for this you must visit the Gym. From here you "design" your boxer by
 specifying height, weight and the characteristics of his fighting style
 and even down to the colour of his baggy stain shorts. A "Champ" of upto
 ten boxers can be held at any one time. If you Gym gets full then you will
 have to "fire" your least favourite boxer via th DELETE function.

 Enter the GYM via the Main Menu. Once inside you will visit th locker
 room where you can flick through your database of current fighting
 boxers. Use the NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons to go through them all.

 BOXER CREATION
 --------------

 To add a new boxer to the camp, select CREATE.

 This takes you to the 4D Sports Boxing Champion Generation Machine.

 You will see your brand new boxer strutting his funky stuff to the side of
 the screen. On the right are a list of options that  make up the Boxer`s
 pyhsiqure and fightinhg characteristics.

 Then Follow Onscreen prompts.

 Once you have created your Boxer its time for the hard bit... The Fight!
