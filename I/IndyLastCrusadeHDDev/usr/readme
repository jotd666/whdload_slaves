 This install applies to "Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade" © 1989 Lucasfilm Games.

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.


 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

History:

 version 2.0 (20.03.2020) done by JOTD:
 - fixed freezes and wrongly playing music, same issue as Loom (issue #0004042, probably #0003019)
 - install script updated to support the 2 ways disk 2 and disk 3 are named
   (all SPS versions have been successfully installed)

 version 1.5 (01.01.2019)
 - support for CDTV version (issue #0003762)
 - reduced OS swaps when saving games
 
 version 1.4 (31.05.2010)
 - reassembled from new kickemu
 - reworked package

 version 1.3 (06.03.2004)
 - support for another version (with Powerpacker 2 crunched file)
 - reassembled with new kickemu, keyboard bugs should have disappeared

 version 1.2 (18.12.2002)
 - now uses original dos library
 - If you've got the A1200 3.1 kickstart
   file, installs a slave using 3.1 ROM. Fixes some reported freezes.
 - source included
 - there will be more os swaps, but that's still bearable

 version 1.1 (2002)
 - bugfix. Game was stuck in students class

 version 1.0 (2001) done by JOTD
 - initial release
 - Translation tables protection removed (by me this time :))
 - Should support all original versions (french, english, german)
 - Quit key (numerical '*', or configurable with QUITKEY)
 - Walkthrough included


Notes:

- Due to the shitty cracks I came across, and which did not work because (I think)
  that it relied on a precise memory configuration (present on A500 maybe), the
  patch will not work with cracks (not my fault).
- Sometimes the protection cannot be passed. In that case, type F8, and restart.
  It will work this time :)
- If you type "ESC" when the notebook shows, the protection stays stuck. In that case
  press F8 and restart.

Supported versions:

- french: SPS1986
- german: SPS343
- italian: SPS2323
- german: no SPS, executable packed
- english: SPS1990, probably NTSC as music is slow on PAL
