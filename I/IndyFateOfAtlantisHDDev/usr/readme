 This install applies to "Indiana Jones And The Fate Of Atlantis" © 1992 LucasFilms Games

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 1.0 MB ChipMem and 1.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing num '*' (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 previous versions (1998-2002)
 - Runs fully from HD using WHDLoad/KickEmu/KickDOS
 - Convenient install script
 - No more gfx problems from workbench on AGA machines
 - Codewheel protection removed (custom made, could cause problems with the game)
 - Access fault fixed (same as in Monkey Island 2, a SCUMM bug I think).
 - Load/Save on HD with minimal number of OS swaps (black flashing screens)
 - Quit key (numerical '*', or configurable with QUITKEY)
 - Nice icon by exoticon

Notes:

- Officially only english and french versions are supported, but
  if you want other versions supported, please tell me how the
  IQ points file is called in your version (the dummies translated the
  filename!!)
- I think the patch would work for a non english/french/german version,
  but without an existing IQ points file it would swap A LOT just before
  the game begins (after Indy found the statue, 
  when the program creates IQ points file byte by byte, and causes
  unavoidable OS swaps)
