         DOX TO THE GAME `IMMORTAL` TYPED IN BY SCOOTER-SCOOPEX
         ------------------------------------------------------
                      GENERATIONS AHEAD!!!!


THE MORNING SUN HEATS THE JAGGED PEAKS AS YOU FOLLOW THE FORGOTTEN ROAD DOWN
TO THE VALLEY FLOOR. THE BLEACHED RUINS OF GREAT COLUMNED TEMPLES AND TOWERING
CITADELS RISE FROM THE GRASSY PLAIN LIKE BONES OF SOME COLOSSAL BEAST. THIS
WAS THE ANCIENT CITY OF `ERINOCH` DESTROYED BY THE DRAGONS FIRE OVER A 1000
YEARS AGO. `MORDAMIR` SPOKE OFTEN OF THIS CITY AND THE LABYRINTH BELOW....

`MORDAMIR` YOU THINK BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG AND EAGER TO LEARN
THE SPELLS OF SORCERY. THE OLD WIZARD `MORDAMIR` TOOK YOU IN AND PAIENTLY
TAUGHT YOU THE ARTS OF MAGIC. HE TAUGHT YOU HOW TO READ THE RUNES AND UNLEASH
THEIR POWER. THE POWER OF CHARMS AND FIRE. HE SHOWED YOU THE STRENGTH OF STEEL
AND TAUGHT YOU TO USE YOUR WIZARDS CUNNING, `MORDAMIR` WAS YOUR MASTER, YOUR
MENTOR HE WAS YOUR GUIDE DOWN THE TREACHEROUS PATH OF WIZARDRY. HE WAS YOUR
FRIEND.

MANY YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE YOU LAST SAW THE OLD MAN, YOU ASSUMED HE WAS
DEAD--THAT IS UNTIL A FEW NIGHTS AGO WHEN HE CALLED YOU IN A DREAM. YOU WOKE
WITH AN UNEASY FEELING THAT `MORDAMIR` STILL LIVED--TRAPPED IN A BOTTOMLESS
CAVERN. AND SO YOU SET OUT TO UNRAVEL THE SECRETS OF THE IMMORTAL.

KEY COMMANDS:

MUSIC    --- ON/OFF   -----   PRESS CTRL-S
RESTART  --- TO RESTART A GAME OR LEVEL, PRESS CTRL-R
QUITTING --- REMOVE DISK FROM DRIVE. TURN OFF COMPUTER ([1mREALLY?[0m)

GAME CONTROLS:

YOU BEGIN IN THE ANTECHAMBER THAT LEADS TO LEVEL1...VITALITY IS LIFE..RUN OUT
OF IT AND YOU ARE DEAD..YOU LOSE VITALITY WHEN YOU MONSTERS INFLICT DAMAGE ON
YOU, AND HAVE TO RESTART THE LEVEL OVER(SEE RESTART ABOVE)

USE OF JOYSTICK TO MOVE..THIS IS THE USUAL..IE (IN DIRECTIONAL AGAIN)...TO
MOVE TO THE LEFT JOYSTICK LEFT..UP MOVES YOU UP..DOWN MOVES YOU DOWN([1mDEAD EASY
AINT IT[0m)..

COMBAT:

WHEN A MONSTER ATTACKS YOU, YOU MUST FIGHT TO THE DEATH. THE BEST STRATEGY IS
TO PARRY WHEN YOUR OPPONENT IS ABOUT TO STRIKE. AND ATTACK WHEN HE`S LEAVING
HIMSELF OPEN.

ATTACKING (PUSH FORWARD TO JAB)
SLASH     (PULL BACK, THEN PUSH FORWARD)
PARRYING  (MOVE JOYSTICK RIGHT AND LEFT) IF THE WIZARD IS FACING YOU,
          MOVEMENTS ARE REVERSED.
FIGHTING WHEN THE WIZARD IS FACING YOU MAY BE TRICKY AT FIRST, ITS EASY THOUGH
IF YOU REMEMBER TO ALWAYS MOVE THE JOYSTICK IN THE DIRECTION YOU WANT THE
WIZARD TO LEAN.
LEAN AWAY FROM THE MONSTERS SWING TO PARRY HIS BLOW..YOUR OPPONENT HAS TO PULL
BACK BEFORE HE CAN SWING. WHEN YOU SEE HIM PULL BACK, LEAN IN THE DIRECTION
HIS SWING WILL TRAVEL.

USING ITEMS IN YOUR PACK:

YOU CARRY A PACK WHERE YOU KEEP THE VALUABLE ITEMS YOU FIND. TO LOOK AT THE
ITEMS IN YOUR PACK, PRESS `SPACEBAR` TO USE AN ITEM IN YOUR PACK, MOVE THE
CURSOR TO THE ITEM AND PRESS FIRE. TO VIEW OTHER ITEMS IN YOUR PACK HIGHLIGHT
`OTHER` AND PRESS FIRE.

TO GO BACK TO THE ACTION, MOVE THE CURSOR TO A `BLACK SQUARE` AND PRESS FIRE,
YOU CAN ALSO SELECT YOUR GOLD OR KEY TO GO BACK TO ACTION(DONT WORRY YOU CAN`T
DROP GOLD OR KEYS)

MOST ITEMS ARE ACTIVATED SIMPLY BY SELECTING THEM. A FEW, HOWEVER REQUIRE
ADDITIONAL COMMANDS:

BLINK SPELL ---  ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED THE BLINK SPELL. PRESS FIRE TO BLINK.

CARPET      ---  SELECT THE CARPET TO RIDE THROUGH THE AIR. SELECT AGAIN TO
                 DEACTIVATE.

FIREBALL SPELL   ONCE YOU HAVE SELECTED THE FIREBALL SPELL, PRESS FIRE TO CAST
                 A FIREBALL.

PROTEAN RING     SELECT THE RING TO ACTIVATE ITS MAGIC POWER. SELECTING AGAIN
                 DEACTIVATES IT, NOTE YOU CAN`T CLIMB LADDERS WHILE IN GOBLIN
                 FORM.

DONT DROP ITEMS YOU`LL NEED LATER:

SOMETIMES USING AN ITEM CONSISTS OF SETTING IT DOWN ON THE GROUND - FOR
EXAMPLE, YOU USE A GEM BY SETTING IT DOWN. BE CAREFUL!. IF YOU SET AN ITEM
DOWN IN THE WRONG PLACE, MAKE SURE YOU PICK IT UP AGAIN BEFORE YOU LEAVE OR
YOU WONT FIND IT IN YOUR PACK.

NOTE ON USING ITEMS:

EACH KIND OF ITEM HAS A SPECIFIC USE - SPORES CAN ONLY BE PLANTED IN DIRT,
WHILE THE TROLL RITUAL KNIFE CAN ONLY BE THROWN. YOU CAN`T CONTROL HOW AN ITEM
IS USED, JUST WHEN AND WERE. MOST ITEMS ARE USEFUL ONLY IN A PARTICULAR
PLACE..ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PARTS OF THE GAME IS FIGURING OUT WHICH
ITEM THE SITUATION DEMANDS.

WHEN YOU FIRST GET AN ITEM, THERES NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT IT DOES UNTIL YOU TRY
IT. YOU CAN GUESS AN ITEMS GENERAL USE..YOU WEAR RINGS, YOU DRINK POTIONS..BUT
YOU CAN`T KNOW AN ITEMS MAGICAL PROPERTIES UNTIL YOU TRY IT.

PAUSING THE GAME:

IF YOU NEED TO PAUSE THE GAME..PRESS THE `SPACEBAR` TO BRING UP YOUR PACK..AND
WHEN YOUR READY TO GO BACK INTO ACTION..ITS THE `BLACK SQUARE`..KEYS OR GOLD.
THEN PRESS FIRE.

GETTING OUT OF PIT TRAPS

THERE ARE DEADLY PIT TRAPS IN THE LABYRINTH...IF YOU`RE NOT CAREFUL YOU MAY
FIND YOURSELF HANGING BY YOUR STAFF OVER ROWS OF SHARP SPIKES. FORTUNATELY,
THERE`S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SWINGING OUT BEFORE YOUR STAFF BREAKS.
TO SWING OUT GENTLY ROCK YOUR JOYSTICK BACK AND FORTH AT AN EVEN PACE.

INCREASING VITALITY BY SLEEPING:

PILES OF STRAW PROVIDE COMFORTABLE, SAFE PLACES TO REST AND REGAIN VITALITY,
TO SLEEP, MOVE ONTO THE STRAW AND JUST STAND THERE. AFTER A MOMENT, YOU`LL LIE
DOWN AND GO TO SLEEP...[1mPAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO YOUR DREAMS[0m!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MAKING THE TEXT SCROLL FASTER:

WHILE READING MESSAGES, YOU CAN HOLD DOWN THE `FIRE` TO MAKE THE TEXT SCROLL
FASTER..YOU CAN USE THIS TO SCROLL THROUGH MESSAGES YOU HAVE ALREADY READ, BUT
DONT USE IT TO AVOID READING MESSAGES ALTOGETHER..MOST MESSAGES CONTAIN
IMPORTANT CLUES, YOU`LL NEED TO FINISH THE GAME.

CLIMBING UP AND DOWN LADDERS:

TO CLIMB UP OR DOWN A LADDER, MOVE UP TO IT AND YOU`LL AUTOMATICALLY CLIMB OR
DESCEND. BE CAREFUL GOING DOWN LADDERS..MOVE ONLY TO THE SIDE OF THE OPENING
WITH THE LADDER ON IT OR YOU`LL FALL TO YOUR DEATH.

COMPLETING A LEVEL IN THE LABYRINTH:

WHENEVER YOU COMPLETE A LEVEL, YOU GET A CERTIFICATE. WRITE DOWN YOUR
CERTIFICATES AND KEEP THEM IN A SAFE PLACE. IF YOU QUIT PLAYING THE IMMORTAL,
YOU`LL NEED THE CERTIFICATE LATER, SO YOU CAN START ON THE LEVEL IN WHICH YOU
LEFT OFF.

ONCE YOU HAVE WRITTEN THE CERTIFICATE NUMBER DOWN PRESS FIRE TO BEGIN THE NEXT
LEVEL. OR QUIT AND START THE LEVEL SOME OTHER TIME USING THE CERTIFICATE.

ONLY USEFUL ITEMS GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL:

SOME ITEMS ONLY FUCTION ON A PARTICULAR LEVEL. BEFORE YOU DESCEND TO THE NEXT
LEVEL, THE MAGIC OF THE LABYRINTH WILL REMOVE ANY ITEMS YOU DONT NEED FROM
YOUR PACK.

RESTARTING A GAME OR LEVEL:

IF YOU DIE YOU CAN CHOOSE TO --- * RESTART THE LEVEL YOU ARE ON
                                 * GOTO THE PREVIOUS COMPLETED LEVEL
                                 * START A WHOLE NEW GAME

YOU CAN ALSO RESTART A LEVEL AT ANY TIME DURING THE GAME BY PRESSING CTRL-R

COPY PROTECTION:

OCCASIONALLY A PICTURE OF AN ITEM WILL APPEAR AND YOU`LL BE ASKED TO ENTER A
LETTER...LOOK FOR THE PICTURE IN THE MANUAL THAT MATCHES. FIND THE LETTER IN
THE TABLE BESIDE THE PICTURE, TYPE IT IN AND PRESS `RETURN`..(I HAVE LEFT THIS
IN--PLUS THE REQUESTED PASSWORDS..IN CASE EVEN IN THE CRACKED COPY..SOMETHING
IS MISSED...SCOOTER)

GUIDE TO LEVEL 1:THE CANDLE FLAME LEAPS AND RISES AS YOU ENTER THE SMALL
ANTECHAMBER THAT LEADS TO THE FIRST LEVEL OF THE DUNGEON, A SKULL STARES
VACANTLY AT THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE WALL, A GRIM REMINDER THAT THIS IS "NO
PLACE FOR MORTAL MEN" 
AS YOU APPROACH THE TABLE, AN IMAGE OF MORDAMIR, YOUR LOST MASTER RISES
EERIELY FROM THE FLAME. IT SPEAKS...

MORDAMIR IS HERE, YOU WHISPER. YOU TURN TOWARD THE DOOR. `DUNRIC`...YOU THINK,
ANOTHER OF MORDAMIR`S STUDENTS, NO DOUBT. THE MASTER HAS TAUGHT MANY IN HIS
LIFE, THE THOUGHT THAT YOU AREN'T THE ONLY ONE LOOKING FOR MORDAMIR COMFORTS
YOU...FOR A MOMENT.

"YOU'LL NEED TO FIGHT SOON, SO READ THE SECTION ON COMBAT"

GOBLIN ATTACK:

THE SOUND OF CLASHING STEEL RINGS THROUGH THE AIR AS YOU ENTER THE LONG
CHAMBER. BEFORE YOU LIES AN ARMOURED FIGURE - A MAN - THE BLOOD FROM HIS
WOUNDS STILL COOLING BETWEEN THE TILES OF THE STONE FLOOR.

TO THE RIGHT YOU HEAR A SNARL. FROM ACROSS THE ROOM A GIANT GOBLIN LUMBERS
TOWARD YOU, HIS MUSCLES RIPPLING AS HE RAISES HIS MACE OVER HIS HEAD. YOU
RAISE YOUR SWORD..READYING YOURSELF.

DUNRIC`S SERVANT:

WHO WAS THIS UNFORTUNATE YOU WONDER?..YOU SEARCH HIS BODY AND FIND A SMALL BAG
CONTAINING A RING, AND A SCROLL..INSCRIBED ON THE RING IS A NAME "DUNRIC"

A FIGHTER WOULDNT HAVE NEED FOR A SCROLL OR A RING, YOU THINK, THIS CAN`T BE
DUNRIC..PERHAPS A SERVANT?..THE SOUND OF RENEWED BATTLE SHAKES YOU FROM
YOUR THOUGHTS, SOMEONE ELSE IS IN TROUBLE..YOU MUTTER PICKING UP YOUR STAFF.

"YOU CAN SEARCH FOR ITEMS JUST BY MOVING TO THE AREA YOU WANT TO SEARCH, IF
THERE IS ANYTHING OF INTEREST IN THE AREA, A MESSAGE APPEARS TELLING YOU WHAT
IT IS"

FIRE AT YOUR FINGERS:

YOU GLANCE DOWN AT THE LEATHERY PARCHMENT SCROLL YOU`RE CLUTCHING AND REALIZE
YOUR HOLDING A SPELL OF FIREBALLS, YOU STOP FOR A MOMENT. CLEARING YOUR MIND,
YOU READ THE RUNES, SPEAKING THE ARCANE WORDS OUT LOUD, SLOWLY UNBRAVELLING
THE COILED GLYMPHS AND WEAVING TOGETHER THE INCANTATION. A TINGLING POWER
GATHERS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS. YOU HOLD THE ELEMENT OF FIRE.

"PRESS THE SPACEBAR TO LOOK THROUGH YOUR PACK. MOVE THE CURSOR TO (3) SHOTS
AND PRESS FIRE." WHEN YOUR READY TO CAST A FIREBALL. PRESS THE FIRE...

MORDAMIRS SERVANT:

AS YOU ROUND THE CORNER, THE FRENZIED MOVEMENT OF COMBAT IMMEDIATELY CATCHES
YOUR EYE, A HUGE GOBLIN HIS HANDS WRAPPED AROUND A WICKED MACE. SWINGS
FURIOUSLY AT AN EQUALLY POWERFUL HUMAN WARRIOR..THE MAN MANGES TO DEFLECT TWO
BLOWS BEFORE HE FALTERS AND FALLS BACK. ITS OBVIOUYS HE`S NEAR EXHAUSTION.

REELING ABOUT THE GOBLIN BARES HIS TEETH AND LEAPS TOWARDS YOU,
"DONT INTERFERE" HE SNARLS. YOU COULD FIGHT HIM, YOU THINK, BUT YOUR
FINGERTIPS STILL ITCH WITH THE ELEMENT OF FIRE..THE WORD OF POWER SLIDES
EASILY OFF YOUR TONGUE....THE FIREBALL EXPLODES ON THE GOBLIN AND HE FALLS TO
THE FLOOR, YOU APPROACH THE WARRIOR. YOU MUST FIND MORDAMIR..THE WARRIOR SAYS.
HANDING YOU A KEY, HE HURRIES OUT THE DOOR.

THE KEY YOU DISCOVER, OPENS A NEARBY CHEST. INSIDE YOU FIND A COLLECTION OF
STRANGE ITEMS: **GOLD **A POUCH FULL OF BAIT **A SACK OF SPORES **A BOTTLE
CONTAINING WHAT LOOKS LIKE NORMAL WATER **AND A TATTERED MAP.

YOU PLACE ALL THE ITEMS YOU NEED IN YOUR PACK, MAY NEED THEM LATER, YOU
THINK. SLINGING THE PACK OVER YOUR SHOULDER, YOU SLIP THROUGH THE UPPER DOOR.

THE LIEUTENANTS TREASURE:

YOU SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOU AND LOOK DOWN BOTH ENDS OF THE CORRIDOR, TO YOUR
RIGHT YOU DISCERN THE SHADOWY OUTLINE OF ANOTHER GOBLIN. THOUGH HE`S NOTICED
YOU, HE`S NOT MOVING TOWARDS YOU, YOU WHISPER, LIFTING YOUR HAND, AND THIS
ONE`S FOR YOU.

YOU SEARCH THE LIEUTENANT AND FIND A NOTE, A KEY AND MORE GOLD. YOU HASTILY
OPEN THE NOTE. THE HAND WRITING, YOU NOTICE IN DISTINCTLY HUMAN. IT ALMOST
LOOKS FAMILIAR...."BEWARE OF SHADES" YOU READ, THEY ARE DANGEROUS, INVISIBLE
CREATURES THAT LIKE DARKNESS. BY FIRELIGHT THEY CAST A SHADOW BY WHICH YOU CAN
DETECT AND AVOID THEM.

YOU DROP THE NOTE AND STEP THROUGH THE DOOR.

STONE SKULLS LINE THE WALLS OF THE CHAMBER IN WHICH YOU FIND YOURSELF. YOUR
WIZARDS SENSE TELLS YOU THERE`S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS ROOM...BUT YOUR NOT
SURE WHAT. YOU`VE SEEN THIS ROOM BEFORE..OR A PICTURE OF IT, THAT IS...

YOU OPEN YOUR PACK AND PULL OUT A MUSTY TOME: THE CODEX OF THE SERPENT..(ITS
FURTHER ON IN THIS DOC)

SHADES IN THE SHADOWS:

YOU NARROWLY ESCAPE THE FLYING ARROWS WITH YOUR LIFE!. YOU SLAM SHUT THE DOOR
BEHIND YOU AND FALL AGAINST THE WALL, CATCHING YOUR BREATH. BUT THE ROOM
YOU`RE STANDING IN SEEMS DISTURBING TOO."MORE TRAPS" YOU CURSE.

YOU OPEN YOUR PACK AND TAKE OUT THE MAP YOU FOUND IN THE CHEST. THIS ROOM DOES
RESEMBLE ONE OF THE ROOMS TRACED ON THE PARCHMENT. YOU NOTICE SOME CONSPICUIOS
RED DOTS...THEY MUST MARK DANGER. THERE ARE RED DOTS MARKING TRAPS IN THE NEXT
ROOM TOO, THESE ARE SURELY THE HALLS OF HELL, SKIRTING THE UPPER LEFT WALL,
YOU MAKE YOUR WAY OVER TO THE DOOR.

THE DOOR OPENS INTO A DARK ROOM. YOU NOTICE THE TORCHES ALONG THE WALLS ARE
OUT, AND SUDDENLY REMEMBER THE WARNING ON THE NOTE -SHADES!-.

A FIREBALL COULD LIGHT A TORCH. MOVING ALONG THE WALL, YOU SHOOT YOUR LAST
FIREBALL. THE TORCH LIGHTS, AND JUST AHEAD YOU MAKE OUT THE SHADOWS OF 2
SHADES. ON THE FAR END OF THE ROOM YOU MAKE OUT SOME OBJECTS ON THE FLOOR.
MIDFUL OF THE TRAPS AND SHADES, YOU CROSS THE ROOM AND PICK UP A CURIOUS
AMULET AND A SPELL WITH WHICH YOU CAN CHARM WILL "O" THE WISPS..WITH YOUR EYE
ON THE 2 SHADES, YOU CROSS DOWN TO THE DOOR. LOCKED!..FORTUNATELY YOU HAVE THE
KEY...

BY THE LIGHT OF ETERNITY:

IN THE ROOM YOU FIND A DEEP,ABRUPT CAVERN IN THE DUNGEON FLOOR. WHAT TERRIBLE
POWER, YOU IMAGINE, COULD BORE SUCH A HOLE THROUGH THE EARTH!. NO MAN CAN
PERFORM SUCH A FEAT! THIS IS THE WORK OF A COLOSSAL BEAST. AN ANGRY BEAST...

YOU NOTICE THE BEAM OF LIGHT PEAKING THROUGH THE DUNGEON WALL. THE SHAFT OF
LIGHT FALLS ON A DIAL INSCRIBED ON THE FLOOR. AT THE END OF THE DIAL, EMBEDDED
,ON THE FLOOR, IS A BRILLIANT JEWEL AS LARGE AS A MANS FIST. THE JEWEL AND THE
SHAFT OF LIGHT YOU IMAGINE, MAKE UP A SPECIAL MECHANISM OF SOME SORT.

YOUR CURIOUS ABOUT THE MECHANISM, BUT AT THE MOMENT YOU FEEL TO TIRED TO
FIGURE HOW IT WORKS, YOU CROSS OVER TO A COSY PILE OF STRAW, YOU NOTICED IN
THE UPPER PART OF THE ROOM. SLEEP OVERTAKES YOU QUICKLY, AND YOU DREAM.

WHEN YOU AWAKE YOU STUDY THE MECHANISM MORE CLOSELY. THE SUNLIGHT NEEDS TO
STRIKE THE JEWEL, THAT MUCH SEEMS OBVIOUS, EVERY YEAR THE BEAM OF LIGHT INCHES
CLOSERE TO THE JEWEL. WHAT?! AT THIS RATE THE SUN WONT STRIKE THE JEWEL FOR A
1000 YEARS!..YOU DONT HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME. WHAT MORTAL DOES!!

PERHAPS IF YOU COULD DEFLECT THE LIGHT?...YOU COULD FOOL THE MECHANISM......

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     THE CODEX OF THE SERPENT
                     ************************

LEVEL 1

I MORDAMIR, WIZARD OF THE CRIMSON KEEP. WROTE THESE NOTES FOR YOU, MY LOYAL
APPRENTICES AND STUDENTS, TO EXPLAIN THE MYSTERIES OF THIS DARK LABYRINTH.
TODAY I FORTH TO EXPLORE THE DRAGONS LAIR. I HOPE MY WITS ARE KEEN ENOUGH TO
ESCAPE HER CUNNING AGAIN!...THUS I LEAVE THESE WORDS FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE TO
COME AFTER ME, MAY THEY KEEP YOU FROM AN UNTIMELY END IN THIS FORSAKEN PLACE!

DUNRIC---MY FAITHFULL STUDENT IN THE ART OF WIZARDRY--WILL BE THE FIRST TO
COME LOOKING FOR ME.HE`S OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY EREK, A FIGHTER

ULINDOR--MY SERVANT AND BODYGUARD.

UPPER LEVELS--A TRIBE OF PRIMATIVE CREATURES KNOWN AS GOBLINS, HOSTILE TO
STRANGERS, BUT SEEM TO POSSESS REASON.INTELLIGENCE AND INGENUITY WITH TOOLS.

A SAFE PATH PAST THE ARROWS..I GOT THIS FAR BEFORE I SET OF THE TRAP..DANGER
PIT TRAPS..IN THE DARK ROOM THAT FOLLOWS ARE DEADLY CREATURES, INVISIBLE TO
THE EYE. ONLY THEIR SHADOWS CAN BE SEEN LIGHT. KEEP A TORCH LIT AND WATCH
THEIR MOVEMENTS CAREFULLY. THEY MOVE QUICKLY!..THERE ARE PIT TRAPS IN THIS
ROOM AS WELL...

RIDDLE OF THE SUN:

DEEP IN THE IMMORTAL DRAGONS LAIR, ONCE IN ONE MILLENIUM, THE PORTAL OPENS TO
THE STAIR, WHEN A SINGLE GEM MEETS THE SUN. A MECHANISM TRIPPED EVERY THOUSAND
YEARS BY LIGHT.....SOMETHING SHINY


LEVEL 2

FROM A TEXT I FOUND ON THE HISTORY OF THIS EVIL PLACE.

AFTER 2 BITTER COMBAT, ARINAR THE ELVEN LORD ESCAPED THE ENEMY, BUT THROUGH
HIS VEINS RAN A FATAL POISON, DRAWN FROM THE KEEN EDGE OF THE SHADOWLORDS
BLADE. ARINAR FLED OVER THE HIGH MOUNTAINS TO THE RUINED CITY OF ERINOCH,
WHERE HE ENTERED THE LABYRINTH IN SEARCH OF THE FABLED WATER, SAID BY MANY TO
HEAL THE DEEPEST OF WOUNDS.

DEEP IN THE CHILLY CAVERNS OF THE FORGOTTEN LABYRINTH, THE ELVEN LORD SEARCHED
DESPERATELY FOR THE FOUNTAIN. SLAYING THE EVIL MINIONS THAT DWELL IN THAT DARK
PLACE WITH SOLONDUL. A GREAT SWORD OF MIGHT, BUT ON THE SECOND DAY, FOUL SLIME
CREATURES CAUGHT ARINAR OFF GUARD AND STRIPPED THE FLESH FROM HIS BODY. TO
THIS DAY HIS BONES AND SWORD LAY THERE STILL....

LEGENDS HAVE TOLD OF WAYFARERS BEING ATTACKED BY WILL O WISPS, I RECKONED 
SUCH STORIES WERE THE PRODUCTS OF CHILDISH IMAGINATIONS, BUT NOW I HAVE SEEN
THESE HATEFUL CREATURES WITH MY OWN EYES, I KNOW LITTLE OF THEIR NATURE...ARE
THEY INTELLIGENT?..PERHAPS THEY ARE DISEMBODIED SPIRITS OF SOME SORT, OR MAYBE
CREATURES OF THE ELEMENTS, IN ANY CASE, THEY ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS---THEY
DESPISE THE LIVING AND EAGERLY ATTACK MORTAL FLESH.

MAYBE I CAN DEVISE A SPELL TO BRING THEM UNDER CONTROL....


SPORES--THE GOBLINS SOMETIMES USE THEM AS A KIND OF WEAPON, WHEN PLANTED IN
SOFT DIRT, THESE SPORES PRODUCE MUSHROOMS THAT GROW TO WAIST HEIGHT IN A
MATTER OF SECONDS. THE FULL GROWN MUSHROOMS IMMEDIATELY FIRE MORE SPORES IN A
RADIUS OF 30 FEET. THE SPORES, IT MUST BE ADDED ARE DEADLY TO HUMANS,GOBLINS
AND TROLLS. THE GOBLINS TYPICALLY CARRY THEM IN SACKS AROUND THEIR NECKS TO
PROTECT THEMSELVES.

THEY CAN BE RECOGNISED BY THEIR STRONG,SICKENING SMELL.

YEARS AGO, WHEN SORCERERS TOWERS STRETCHED TOWARDS THE HEAVENS AND THE HALLS
OF WIZARDRY PROTECTED THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPHERES, THE CITY OF ERINOCH HAD
NEED OF LOCKSMITHS, THE MOST CUNNING LOCKSMITH I RECALL WAS A DWARF BY THE
NAME OF LINDL. HIS LOCKS NEVER INVOLVED ANYTHING AS BORING AS A SIMPLE LOCK
AND KEY. LINDLS MECHANISMS REUIRED THE UNUSUAL--FINELY CRAFTED GEMS, BEAMS OF
LIGHT, PACES AROUND AN OBJECT...

LINDL PROSPERED WHILE SERVING THE WIZARDS OF ERINOCH. BUT WHEN THE DRAGON CAME
OVER 1000 YEARS AGO, HIS HOUSE WAS DESTROYED AND HIS FAMILY PERISHED IN THE
FLAMES. LINDL WENT QUITE MAD AFTER SEEING THE BEAST DEVASTATE HIS DREAMS, AND
HE CURSED THE WIZARDS WHO UNLEASHED THE DRAGONS WRATH. HE VOWED TO SEAL OF THE
LABYRINTH FOREVER..SO THAT MEN COULD NO LONGER SEEK THE WATER.

THE MAGIC DUST CAN BE THROWN TO MAKE AN IRRITABLE OLD FOOL, YOU FRIEND.

THE GEMS MUST BE DROPPED IN THE HOLES. GRESH AND WISE, KING OF THE GOBLINS,
KNOWS THE COMBINATION. ONE MUST DEFEAT HIM BEFORE HE`LL SPEAK.

LEVEL 3

ONLY THE FIERCE MIGHT OF AN ANGRY DRAGON COULD SPLIT THE EARTH AND FORM THIS
GREAT CHASM. THE CRACK CANNOT BE CROSSED BY ROPE--THE BRISK WINDS RISING FROM
THE DRAGONS LAIR MAKE IT TOO DANGEROUS!. THE ONLY WAY ACROSS IS A MAGIC GATE
--A TELEPORT MECHANISM--HIDDEN IN ONE OF THE ROOMS BELOW. THE SHAFT OF LIGHT
ON THE OTHER SIDE IS WHERE THE MAGIC GATE LEADS.

TROLLS--THE SHINDRAK, AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES, RULE MUCH OF THE LOWER LEVELS.
FOR THE MOST PART. THEY ARE STUPID AND QUICK TEMEPERED--SOMETHING TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF.

A TROLL WILL THROW HIS RITUAL KNIFE ONLY WHEN HE WANTS TO CHALLENGE ANOTHER
TROLL TO COMBAT.

PROTEUS, A GOD OF THE SEA WAS A SHAPE-CHANGER WHO COULD TRAVEL DISGUISED AS
IRE AND WILD BOARS. THIS RING WAS FORGED BY PROTEUS WHEN EARTH WAS YOUNG. IT
ALLOWS THE WEARER TO TAKE THE FORM OF A GOBLIN, BEWARE SOME ARE TO WISE TO
BELIEVE ITS CHARMS.

TROLL BOMB. ONE WIFF OF THESE DEVICES AND TROLLS ARE PARALYZED.

RED GEMS LOOK BEST IN PURPLE LIGHT.

LEVEL 4:

WHEN DUNRIC INTERFERED WITH THE TROLLS BATTLE AGAINST THE GOBLINS, THEY
KIDNAPPED HIS DAUGHTER, ANA. AND DRAGGED HER INTO THE LABYRINTH. AS SHE
POSSESSES SOME OF HER FATHERS SKILL IN SORCERY, SHE HAD NO TROUBLE ESCAPING
THE TROLLS, BUT ON HER WAY OUT, SHE LOST A SPECIAL RING GIVEN TO HER BY HER
FATHER.

SOME RINGS ARE NEVER WORN ON THE BODY.

LEVEL 5:

THE POTION TRANSFORMS AND POISONS YOU AT THE SAME TIME. YOU WILL BENEFIT FROM
ITS POWER TO SHRINK YOU. BUT YOU MUST FIND WATER AND DRINK SOON AFTERWARDS OR
YOU`LL NEVER LIVE PAST THE HOUR.

MANY MICE BUT FEWER MICE CAN PASS THROUGH A CRACK IN THE WALL. THIS IS THE
ONLY WAY OUT AT THIS LEVEL. WORM SENSOR--THE FASTER IT CHIMES, THE GREATER
YOUR DANGER.

THE WEIGHT OF ONE WILL OPEN THE WAY, SET DOWN THE FOOD AND A FLYING LIZARD
COULD HOLD THE DOOR.

LEVEL 6:

WHEN SHE REARS UP, SHES READY TO WEB. MOVE BACK!

SHE`S MOST VULNERABLE WHEN ALL FOUR LEGS ARE ON THE GROUND.

NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO IMBIBE THE SPIRITS.

LEVEL 7

THE GOBLINS CRAVE THE WATER AS MUCH AS MEN, BUT HORRID WATER CREATURE GUARDS
THE WAY! IF THE WATER MONSTER WERE DISTRACTED LONG ENOUGH. THE GOBLINS COULD
OPEN A GATE AND THE CREATURE WOULD BE WASHED AWAY INTO THE DEEPEST UNDERGROUND
SEA. ONLY A WIZARD, ADEPT AT SAILING, STANDS A CHANCE OF DISTRACTING THE
MONSTER AND MAKING HIS ESCAPE.

THIS IS THE FINAL STEP BEFORE ENTERING THE DRAGONS LAIR...DO WHATEVER YOU MUST
TO HELP THE GOBLINS OPEN THE WAY. YOU JOURNEY IS ALMOST COMPLETE---IF FORTUNE
FINDS US, WE WILL STAND TOGETHER AGAINST THE DRAGON!!!!!
