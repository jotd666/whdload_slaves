 This install applies to "It Came From The Desert" & "Antheads" © 1989 Cinemaware

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.2 (2022) done by JOTD:
 - support for another antheads version (issue #0005596)
 - TODO fix encrypted version just for curiosity sake
 
 version 2.1 (13.04.2022) done by JOTD:
 - support for another antheads version of the executable (issue #002550)
 - included fix from Spyridon Papakotsis (issue #0003900)
 - support for spanish fanmade version (requested by Toni Galvez, who 
   also did the spanish voice, yes this fan version has translated SOUND too). Well
   it worked out of the box, but now that's official.
 - support for italian fanmade version (issue #0005217)
 - black screen at startup instead of 1.3 dos screen
 
 version 2.0 (08.11.2010) done by JOTD:

 - SPS version 14 supported

 version 1.1 (09.06.2007) done by JOTD:
 - fixed blitter wait
 - adapted to data disk (Antheads / ICFD II)

 version 1.0 (05.09.2005) done by JOTD:
 - install script supports free version from cinemaware site
   (with faulty disk 3). Instead of including the 200K file, I made
   a program to copy as much of the file as possible from the disk, and
   then append the non-working part with a provided file (thanks Chris
   for the original and working version !!)
 - re-assembled slave
 - source code included

 version 0.1 (20.11.2002) done by JOTD:
 - initial pre-release
 - many icons provided
 - manual included
 - solution included

 Notes:
 
 - The "Anthead" version works but if you leave the intro running, you'll face a black screen
   where you have to press "fire" in order to continue. I think that this is the "do you want to restart
   from a saved game" screen, only this is black. Seems that it's an original game bug,
   the color palette in the second copperlist gets zeroed instead of being normal.
   I could fix this but this is minor, and fixing would be quite tedious. Maybe if someone donates $$$...
   Solution: skip the intro or press fire when it happens.
   

 - The fix included in the newest 2022 release (http://m68k.aminet.net/package/game/patch/ICFDesert_fix): This program fixes the "Billy Bob Bug", which causes the game to
   crash if you choose to "Flee" when Billy Bob Morse pulls out a knife
   at the Neptune Hall, on the 6th day.

  - I ended up supporting a very strange executable version for "Antheads". This "dshell" file
   is slightly bigger than the others and starts with strong encryption and trace vector decoder. But
   it's neither Rob Northen nor Ben Herdnon. And the disk seemed unprotected too...
   I skipped the decryption, let WinUAE handle that, just give me the real entry point, let's fix 
   a few missed relocs and (after a few hours struggling) it runs.
   Not sure of what it brings to the game... There were already working versions of "dshell"
   running Antheads but for some reason that one had encryption on it so I HAD to make it work too.
