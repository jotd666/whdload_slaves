                         Indianapolis 500
                          The Simulation
                    Typed by Sentry of Thunderdome

Before playing Indianapolis 500, copy the disk.  Put the original
disk away and play with your copy.  For information about copying
disk, see your AmigaDOS manual.
Note:  Indy 500 does not support hard drive installation.

Starting The Game

1.  Turn on your computer (duh).  Amiga 1000 must use Kickstart 1.2
    or 1.3 at the prompt.
2.  At the Workbench prompt, insert your COPY of Indy 500 into df0:
3.  First you'll see the Indy title screen and then the demo (computers
    with less than 1 megabyte of memory don't have a demo).  Press Esc,
    a joystick button, or a mouse button to continue.
4.  You're shown the winning car from a past Indy 500, and you're asked
    a trivia question about it. (Nevermind this part, it CRACKED!)
    
Note:  You must reboot your machine to exit Indianapolis 500.

DRIVING CONTROLS

To learn how to drive choose Practice from the Main menu.  Highlight
Practice by pressing the Spacebar, the Up or Down arrows, or by moving 
the mouse forward and backward.  Press Return or the mouse button to 
select Practice.  You're in the pit.  Above your dashboard is the Pit
Board.  See "The Pit Board" for a description of this board.  For now,
just accelerate out of the pit and the pit board will disappear.

You can drive your car with the mouse, keypad, or joystick.

Steering with the Mouse
Your mouse should be plugged into mouse/joystick port #1.  The mouse 
acts like a steering wheel; the more you move it to the right or left,
the more you turn the wheels.  To avoid sharp turns or overreaction, 
move the mouse lightly and carefully.  In most situations you don't 
need to move it much to control the car.

Steering with the Keyboard
Each steering key turns the wheels; the longer you press the key, the 
more the wheels turn.  When you release the key, your wheels straighten
out gradually.  As you round corner, listen for the squeal of your tires 
which indicates loss of grip.  Release the key momentarily to allow the
tires to regain traction.  Use this technique throughout the turns.

Steering with the Joystick
Your joystick should be plugged into mouse/joystick port #2.  Move the 
joystick right or left to turn the wheels; the longer you hold the joy-
stick to one side, the more the wheels turn.  If you release the joystick,
your wheels straighten out gradually.  As you round corner, listen for
the squeal of your tires which indicates loss of grip.  Release the 
joystick momentarily to allow the tires to regain traction.  Use this 
technique throughout the turns.

Driving in Reverse
To drive in reverse, first come to a full stop.  Press the down arrow,
or press 2 on the keypad, or pull back on the mouse.

Adjusting Cruise Control
C

Cruise control maintains your speed so you don't have to hold down the
throttle.  Disengage cruise by hitting the brakes or the throttle. 
(Cruise also disengage when you collide with the wall.)  If you hold down
the C key, you'll accelerate until you release it (unless you reach max
speed) - your cruise will be set to the speed you were going when you 
release the key.  When learning to drive, cruise control allows you to
get used to the track without worrying about speeding up or slowing down.
When driving during a yellow flag, cruise control lets you drive at a
steady speed without having to think about keeping up or falling back.

Other Controls
Ctrl-R                   This restarts your current event, as though you
                         returned to the Main menu and select Practice,
                         Qualify, or Race again.
                         
P                        Pause the game

Esc                      Return to menu

THE PIT BOARD

You pit has a big red "X" along the pit wall.  Whenever you stop the car
in your pit, the Pit Board appears.  If you press a function key (F1, F2,
etc.), the Pit Board disappears.  Tap the brake to display the Pit Board
again.

The fuel indicator shows approximately how much fuel you have; the more
fuel you have, the more color there is in the indicator.  Your tank can 
hold up to 40 gallons.  Highlight the word Fuel on the pit board by 
pressing the Spacebar, and then press Return to fill the tank to your
current Fuel setting.

To change your Fuel setting, first select Fuel by pressing the Spacebar.
Now decrease the fuel amount by pressing <(or ",") and increase the
amount by pressing >(or ".").
Each tire shows its tire wear; the more a tire is greyed out, the more
worn out it is.  If the tire is all grey, it'll soon fail.  To replace 
the tire, highlight it by pressing the Spacebar, and then press Return.

CAR SETTINGS

To display a car setting menu, press a function key.

    F3    Fuel              F7    Pressures
    F4    Wings             F8    Shocks
    F5    Rubber            F9    Cambers
    F6    Stagger           F10   Gears
    
You can change the settings F3-F7 at anytime during Practice, but only
in the pit during Racing and Qualifying.  You can change the settings
F8-F10 only during Practice or in the pit during Qualify.

To change the setting of the component that's highlighted, press < and >
(or "," and ".").

To highlight a different component (for instance, a shock or a tire), 
press the Spacebar or Tab to cycle through all the components clockwise
or press Backspace or Shift-Tab to cycle through all the components
counter-clockwise.

LAP INFO AND STANDINGS

To display Lap Info or Standings, press the function key listed.
F1   Lap Info
F2   Standings

To scroll your view up and down the pole to see all the standings, press
< and >(or "," and ".").

MAIN MENU

Press Esc any time to display the Main Menu.  This is where you make
your major selections.  Unavailable items are dimmed.

Press Esc to exit a sub menu and return to the Main menu.  Also press
Esc if you crash, blow a tire, or blow your engine to return to the 
Main menu.

SELECTING OPTIONS FROM THE MENU

Use the commands below to make selections from this menu, all sub menus,
and the Pit Board.

Mouse Users
To move the highlight down, pull the mouse toward you; to move the high-
light up, push the mouse away from you.  To select the highlighted option,
press a mouse button.

Keyboard Users
To move the highlight down, press the Spacebar or the Down Cursor key.
To move the highlight up, press Backspace or the Up Cursor key.  To
select the highlighted option, press Return.

Joystick Users
To move the highlight down, pull the joystick toward you, to move the 
highlight up, push the joystick forward.  To select the highlighted option,
press the joystick button.

Resume Driving
This option exits the Main menu and returns you to the track where you 
left off practicing, qualifying, or racing.  This option is not available
if you have not gone to the track yet.  It also isn't available if you
load a new car or car settings during qualifying or racing.

Instant Replay
This shows you the last twenty seconds of the action on the track.
(Note: There is no Instant Replay feature on computers with less than
1 megabytes of available memory.)
When you reach the end of the replay tape, a horizontal line rolls down
the screen and the replay starts over.  Highlight the view you want by 
pressing Spacebar, or by moving the mouse or joystick forward, backward,
right, or left.

   InCar       TV

Control the replay with the following commands:

> or "." or right mouse button          Fast forward
< or "," or left mouse button           Rewind
P                                       Pause on/off

To step forward and backward frame by frame, press P to pause the replay, 
and then press the fast forward or rewind keys.  Press P again to remove
pause.  Press Esc to leave Instant Replay.

Practice
Enter the Practice mode.  You start in the pit viewing the Pit Board.
(See Pit Board section).  Just accelerate to hide the Pit Board and leave 
the pit.  Be careful not to hit the wall at the end of the pit row.

You can change any of your car settings during Practice any time.  This 
lets you quickly see how settings affect your car's handling.  Your tires
and engine are subject to normal ware, and they may fail if abused, but
collisions won't damage your car during Practice.  Press Esc or Ctrl-R
to continue if you blow an engine or a tire.

Qualify
Begin qualifying.  Set up your car before qualifying because anti-roll bars
and turboboost are the only settings you can change without pulling into
the pit.  The faster you drive four consecutive laps the farther ahead in
the pack you'll start the race. 
    
For an added advantage during qualifying, reduce your fuel load to 10 gallons
(must be done in Practice mode or in the pit).  Also increase your turboboost
setting to 9, the maximum.  Be sure to increase your fuel supply and reduce
your turboboost before you start a race.

You start your first lap already in motion - a "rolling start" - just before
the start/finish line.  Drive the fastest four laps you can.  The Standings
display appears when you're done to show your new field position.  If you
stop in the pit during qualifying, your attempt is aborted.  Restart qualify-
ing by pressing Esc.

Remember that your car can be damaged during qualifying.  If you suspect an
equipment failure, check the top left corner of your screen.  For example,
if you blow a tire, you'll see a flashing message like TIRE BLEW or ENGINE
BLOWN.  Press Esc to see the Main menu, or press Ctrl-R to restart the event.

Race
Choose the race length you want:

 10 laps  =   25 miles     (no car damage from collisions;
                           no yellow flags)
 30 laps  =   75 miles     (no car damage from collisions)
 60 laps  =  150 miles
200 laps  =  500 miles

Notes:  For races where collisions don't cause damage, your car is 
still subject to wear.  The race begins with a rolling start, with 
all the drivers in their qualifying positions, as show below.

                    Pole    1       2       3
                    
                            4       5       6
                            :       :       :
                            :       :       :
                            31      32      33
                            
As in qualifying, anti-roll bars and boost are the only settings you 
can change without pulling into the pit.

When the winner crosses the finish line, he takes the checkered flag 
and the race is over.  If you win, press Esc to enjoy the victory 
celebration.  Press the Spacebar or the mouse button to see each screen
until you end up at the Main menu.  Everyone else in the race gets 
ranked according to their placement at that time.

Teams
Choose one of these three team/engine combinations:

   March/Cosworth
   Lola/Buick
   Penske/Chevrolet
   
The Chevrolet and Cosworth engines both reach their peak horsepower at 
approximately 12,000 rpms.  The Buick engine redlines (reaches peak
horsepower) at 9,000 rpms, and it therefore needs lower gear ratios than
the Chevrolet and Cosworth engines.

The cars have different initial settings.  The March/Cosworth is the 
easiest to drive, but it's the slowest.  The Penske/Chevrolet is the
most difficult to drive, and has the fastest setup.  The cars have 
different handling characteristics, but none of them is inherently
faster than the others.  It's all a matter of settings.  The cars are
set up this way so you can progress from a slow easy-to-drive car to
a fast hard-to-drive car as your skill increases without changing many
settings.

There are three car settings you can load from the File selection of the
Main menu (See "File" below).  Car Settings 1 and 2 are intended for the 
Lola/Buick.  Car Setting 1 is equivalent to the March/Cosworth default 
settings, and Car Setting 2 is equivalent to the Penske/Chevrolet default
settings.  Loading one of these two settings lets you set up the Lola/Buick
like either of the two cars, but with gear ratios appropriate for the
Lola/Buick engine.  Car Setting 3 is intended for the Penske/Chevrolet and
is equivalent to the March/Cosworth default settings.  This lets you drive
the Penske/Chevrolet with easier settings than its default configuration.

If you change teams during racing or qualifying, you forfeit the race or
qualifying attempt and can't Resume Driving.  You must select Practice,
Qualify, or Race to get back on track.

File
You can load and save up to three different car settings.  You must 
remember which one is which.  If you load new settings, you can't resume
qualifying or a race.  If you save a car settings, you will overwrite
the existing one.  Save you files on your copy of Indy 500 or else you
will permanently lose the original settings for that car.

Remember which car settings is for.  If you load a setting into a different
car, the performance will be different.  If you load a Chevrolet configur-
ation into a Buick engine, you could even blow the engine because the gear
ratio might be too high.

You can also load and save one instant replay.  If you load an instant
replay, you must watch it before choosing Resume Driving or it will be
replaced with new track footage.  Save replays on you copy of Indy 500.

Options

MOUSE SENSITIVITY
To get to this option, press Esc, choose Options from the Main menu, and
