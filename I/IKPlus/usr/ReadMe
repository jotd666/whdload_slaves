	That install applies to "IK+" © 1988 Archer Maclean.
	The original disk release, the HitSquad rerelease and the CDTV

	That install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path.
	Both can be found in the WHDLoad package.

	installation mode.

	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.

	ProPack or FImp (but without extension!).
