 This install applies to "International 3D Tennis" (c) 1990 Sensible 
 Software/Palace - 1 disk. Thanks to Didier Giron and Philippe Bovier 
 for the original!

REQUIREMENTS:
- Slave requires WHDLoad V10+ and RawDIC.
- Game requires 512k chip mem (+0.6Mb other memory for preload option)

Version 1.1 (16.05.2020) done by JOTD:
- adapted stupid RNC decrunch overflow that required more than 512k chipmem
  now file is decrunched lower in memory, and moved at the proper location (issue #0004529)
- fixed possible random lockup in title music replay (at least on WinUAE)

Version 1.0 (21.08.2001) done by Codetapper:
- Full load from HD
- Protection removed (Dos/MFM combination and speed check on track 1)
- Loads and saves games (an absolute nightmare to code!)
- Joystick and mouse ports swapped around
- Mouse port is disabled by default so you can play a one player game.
  Toggle the mouse port on/off by pressing Help
- Snoop bug fixed (access to kickstart Rom)
- Colour bit fixes (x2)
- Instructions included
- International keyboard support (requires WHDLoad 12+)
- All files can be crunched to save space (Propack, Fimp etc)
- RomIcon, NewIcon and GlowIcon (created by me!)
- Quit option (default key is 'PrtSc')

This was one of the hardest patches I have ever done, mainly because the 
code for loading and saving games is very complex and spaghetti like.

I have fixed absolutely everything I could think of in this game.  In the
original, the game stupidly requires you to plug a joystick into the mouse
port and worse still, if you forget about this, you cannot actually select
any of the options on the title screen!  Press Help to toggle the mouse
port back on if you are playing a two player game.

Greetings to those of you who prefer quality fixes than fast half finished
ones.
