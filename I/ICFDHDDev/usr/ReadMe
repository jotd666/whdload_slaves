 This install applies to "It Came From The Desert" & "Antheads" Â© 1989 Cinemaware

 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path. It can be found in the
 WHDLoad package.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 1.0 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page or create a mantis issue directly
 at http://mantis.whdload.de

 version 2.0 (08.11.10) done by JOTD:

 - sound samples now play OK (donkey)

 version 1.2 (09.03.08) done by JOTD:
 - SPS version 14 supported

 version 1.1 (09.06.07) done by JOTD:

 - adapted to data disk (Antheads / ICFD II)

 version 1.0 (05.09.05) done by JOTD:
 - install script supports free version from cinemaware site
   (with faulty disk 3). Instead of including the 200K file, I made
   a program to copy as much of the file as possible from the disk, and
   then append the non-working part with a provided file (thanks Chris
   for the original and working version !!)
 - re-assembled slave
 - source code included

 version 0.1 (20.11.02) done by JOTD:
 - initial pre-release
 - many icons provided
 - manual included
 - solution included

 Notes:
 
 - The "Anthead" version works but if you leave the intro running, you'll face a black screen
   where you have to press "fire" in order to continue. I think that this is the "do you want to restart
   from a saved game" screen, only this is black for some strange reason. I'm not fixing this.
   Solution: skip the intro or press fire when it happens.
